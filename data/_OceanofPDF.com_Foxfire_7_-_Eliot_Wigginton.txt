INTRODUCTION 
During the spring of 
1975, and shortly be¬ 
fore my graduation 
from the University of Virginia, I came home to Rabun Gap to visit 
my family and to think about the future. Graduate school, some 
travel, a job in Atlanta—these were all viable options, but at this 
point I was still very much undecided. I hoped that the tranquility 
and serenity that so often accompanies this particular season in these 
parts would help me better sort out what was going on inside. 
One incredibly warm, breezy, and vibrant afternoon I stopped 
by the Foxfire office which, at that time was at the Rabun Gap-Nacoo- 
chee School. It was much like I had remembered it almost four 
years before. Collected artifacts of many shapes and sizes still hung, 
rested, and were propped everywhere. In shelves, on cabinets and 
tables, they stood as vivid reminders of an era gone by. There were 
berry buckets and spinning wheels and homemade fiddles. In one 
comer was a miniature moonshine still fashioned by Buck Carver 
and in another was some large and striking folk art designed and 
carved by C. P. Ligon. 
Of course, there were students everywhere (I later found out that 
I had dropped in during the Foxfirejournalism class). I could overhear 
several of them making new discoveries in the photography dark 
room. Others were opening mail and dealing with correspondence 
and circulation. One group had just brought back an interview with 
Kenny Runion, a local craftsman and story teller, and were eagerly 
listening to this tape; and as always there were those faithfully putting 
in their time on the transcribers, painstakingly writing out each and 
every word of a two-hour interview. 
Among all of this activity, adult staff members Suzy Angier, Margie 
Bennett, and Eliot Wigginton were busily running to and fro—offer¬ 
ing encouragement, advice, planning strategy, but for the most part 
letting the students follow their instincts, make their own decisions 
and bear up under the ensuing responsibility. Foxfire, the program 
designed to provide alternative and experiential educational ap¬ 
proaches to learning, was, it seemed, still working well. 
As I surveyed all of this activity and organized confusion, I remem¬ 
bered my days as a Foxfire student. And they were not those dreary 
and overly sentimental class reunion type of remembrances, but 
more that as a high school student I had done something real and 
workable, positive and productive. I remembered the many hours 

============================================================

io 
FOXFIRE 7 
that I had spent at Aunt Arie Carpenter’s, the eighty-seven-year- 
old lady who lived by herself in a log home, and how her quiet 
and gentle, but powerful philosophy and outlook on life had a pro¬ 
found effect on my development. I remembered the time Mike Cook 
(who is now in charge of television and video production for Foxfire) 
and I went up to Harley Thomas’ and recorded on paper and film 
his demonstration of the intricate dovetail notch that was once used 
in the mountains as a way of constructing the walls for a log cabin; 
or Jake Waldrop, who took us on a hike through the mountains in 
search of ginseng and showed us how to make a turkey call from 
a bone in the wing of that animal. I can also remember the introduc¬ 
tions and articles that Wig made us write and rewrite about those 
experiences, and how I was glad he did when I got to college. 
As I looked around that small but busy office and work area, I 
felt good and I knew this experiential philosophy was confining to 
go forward in the right directions. In that office that same afternoon, 
Wig and I had a chance to discuss and reflect and talk about the 
future of the organization. Wig indicated that he would like to see 
planned and well thought out expansion of the program into other 
areas with the addition of new staff members as well. Royalties com¬ 
ing in from the Foxfire books were providing additional income to 
hire more people. I felt like the Foxfire organization was still some¬ 
thing I wanted to be a part of; and after some discussion, I left that 
afternoon with a job I felt good about, and six years later as I sit 
here and struggle with these words, my enthusiasm for the ideals, 
expectations, and goals of the Foxfire organization remains high. 
One of my first responsibilities was to work with a group of stu¬ 
dents who had been involved for a year in the Foxfire process of 
writing, editing, and producing small articles for the magazine and 
who wanted to take this involvement one step further by working 
on something more complex and lengthy. Keith Head, who at that 
time was from Scaly Mountain, was one of those students who 
thought he was ready to tackle a more difficult project. We both 
did not know what his project would be until he showed me a tape 
transcription of an interview he had with his great-grandfather, 
Grandpa Ray Dryman, who was one of the oldest members of the 
Pentecostal Church of God in this area. He discussed at great length 
his involvement with the church and his personal religious experi¬ 
ences. It was in great detail that “Grandpa Ray” talked of the han¬ 
dling of fire, speaking in “tongues,” and other occurrences in his 
church. Keith and I strongly felt great interest in this interview, 
and we agreed that as his project he could again talk to his grandfa-

ther and others in our area who demonstrated strong religious faith 
and gather more information for a better in depth study to document 
“religion” in this part of the Appalachians. 
Keith’s study took on new importance and the material collected 
soon took up a whole filing cabinet drawer. The more we found 
out, the more we realized that the subject of “religion” was broad, 
controversial, and personal. To be as fair and objective as possible, 
many old church preachers and other church people were visited 
and recorded. 
Somewhere along the way, Keith and I came to the realization 
that we would not be finishing up this project during that school 
year. I was developing and teaching other courses and projects, 
and the scope of this subject made us realize that we still had a 
long way to go. Keith was hired to work the summer and after 
another year in college he came back in 1977 for yet another summer 
of research, interviewing, and editing. Another student, Wendy 
Guyaux, who was headed to the University of Georgia in the fall, 
joined Keith in these undertakings. Together they visited more 
preachers and church members from almost every denomination 
in our area and traveled many miles to singings, baptisms, camp 
meetings, foot washings, and revivals. 
By 1978, after these sporadic but intense work efforts on this 
project, we felt most of the research was completed. We were 
still uncertain as to the final form and format our work would 
take. There was a strong feeling among our students and staff 
that due to the importance of religion to the people of our region 
and the fact that it provides the basis for many of their beliefs, 
attitudes, and activities, that the material should be compiled 
and offered as one of the Foxfire book series. Doubleday, Inc., 
accepted the idea, and, thus, Foxfire 7 was officially slated for final 
workup and delivery. This title was chosen because Foxfire 5 had just 
been released and Foxfire 6 was near completion and ready to go. 
By this time, of course, Wendy and Keith were heavily involved 
with college studies and work, but other students helped in numer¬ 
ous ways. Certain groups of Foxfire students were largely responsible 
for putting together other chapters that appear in this book, particu¬ 
larly the ones about shaped-note singing and snake handling; Carol 
Rogers (who took the cover photograph for the hardback version 
of Foxfire 6) spent the most of one summer printing photographs 
and conducting some final and essential interviews, including those 
with Richard Moss and Quay Smathers, both Christian Harmony 
singers; and Rosanne Chastain and Tammy Ledford, two of my pho-

tography students, were responsible for the cover photograph that 
appears on the hardback version of this publication. 
It was also during this time that other help was given. Keith and 
Wendy had strongly felt all along that due to the complex and some¬ 
times controversial nature of the subject matter, some scholarly writ¬ 
ing by a qualified individual would strengthen the validity of their 
documentation and set the work in proper context. Thus, when 
Dr. Bill J. Leonard, Assistant Professor of Church History at the 
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky, of¬ 
fered his services, we accepted. Dr. Leonard wrote a general religious 
and historical overview and a pertinent history of each of the denomi¬ 
nations we covered, the latter appearing as appendixes. In addition, 
Dr. Edith Card, professor of music at Clemson University, Clemson, 
South Carolina, who had previously worked with Foxfire’s music and 
folklore teacher, George Reynolds, and his students, wrote the much- 
needed technical and explanatory preface that appears at the begin¬ 
ning of the chapter on shaped-note singing. Local resident and stu¬ 
dent teacher Susan Davis also added her editing and advisory skills 
in the final stages and helped us to finish up. 
This student-conceived-and-produced project presents a subject 
that at times has been extremely controversial. The word “religion” 
triggers a different response in each of us. We have tried to be 
careful to not make judgments concerning what is repeated herein. 
Religion is personal and each of us chooses to deal or not to deal 
with it in our own way. We found interesting the diverseness of 
beliefs even among the members of a single church. Moreover, the 
various churches of a single denomination were not always in agree¬ 
ment about every doctrine and ordinance. 
This book has been stimulating but difficult at times to compile. 
This is the first Foxfire book dealing with a single subject, but one 
that affects so many people in the mountains. Attempts were made 
to cover all major denominations (these denominations are pre¬ 
sented alphabetically herein); however, since this book is a study 
focusing on the documentation of religious beliefs exerting the most 
influence in our particular area of Appalachia, some may have been 
omitted. To these, we offer our apologies; and to those who were 
gracious enough to allow us to come into their homes and hearts, 
we express our gratitude. 
Simply, this book is about those who appear within, giving per¬ 
sonal accounts of the faith that means so much to them. As you 
read the material, remain mindful of the power of the religion of 
the people in this area. They are not adverse to share.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 
By Bill J. Leonard 
I 
n the sultry heat of a July 
evening a throng of wor¬ 
shippers moves toward the 
open-ended tabernacle from which the sounds of organ music— 
vibrato blaring—fill the summer air. They enter the building to sit 
on rough, straight-back pews on which are strewn the worn gospel 
hymnbooks. The air is heavy with the smell of the sawdust which 
covers the floor. There is singing, then prayers, accompanied by 
an occasional “Yes, Lord” and “Thank you, Jesus,” spoken sponta¬ 
neously from members of the congregation. The preacher, selected 
moments before at the inspiration of the camp director, enters the 
pulpit and the sermon begins. The words come pouring from his 
mouth, warming the already heated night: “Saved . . . Lost . . . 
Heaven . . . Hell . . . blood bought . . . Bible-believing . . . cruci¬ 
fixion, resurrection . . . second coming ...” And the sins—sins 
of sex and alcohol, lying and cheating, disobeying parents, dancing, 
movies, skipping church, refusing to believe the Bible, rejecting the 
Holy Spirit. And then the answer: JESUS!! Trust Him, love Him, 
serve Him, accept Him, believe on Him, fear Him, follow Him. 
Finally comes the call: “Come and receive the good news.” “Stand 
and sing, sing, and sing some more.” 
Just as I am without one plea 
But that Thy Blood was shed for me 
and that Thou bidst me come to Thee 
O Lamb of God, I come. . . . 
They come—first one and then another. Some in stoic silence, 
some with quiet abandon, some in torrents of tears. And with their 
coming all heaven breaks loose. Shouts of “Glory,” “Praise the 
Lord,” “Hallelujah,” “Glory to God,” as salvation and revival come 
to a people. 
The crowd responds, the preacher responds, the organ responds. 
Then, all are seated once again. For another preacher has been 
chosen, another sermon is ready to be proclaimed. Plenty of time 
for one more service, one more call to repentance, that is, if Jesus 
tarries. . . .

The camp meeting, anchored firmly in the American past, contin¬ 
ues as a reality in West Virginia, Georgia, the Carolinas, and through¬ 
out the Bible Belt of the American heartland. It expresses one 
important emphasis of American religion: the abiding concern for 
heart religion and conversionistic faith. 
The sign outside reads, “Old Regular Baptists,” and inside the 
one room, clapboard structure a foot washing is going on. Men 
sit on one side, women on the other. Members bind aprons around 
their middles, take battered dish pans and tattered towels, to kneel 
before fellow Christians in a ritual as old as the Christian church. 
The preacher sounds out the scripture text in a kind of singsong, 
chant-like cadence: 
“The Bible says . . . that the Lord Jesus ... on the night of 
his arrest . . . laid aside his garments . . . and taking a towel 
. . . washed his disciples’ feet . . . OOOOOOO, them feet- 
washin’ Baptists, they’ll be here till the Lord comes again.”1 
After the washing comes the supper. “Do this in memory of me.” 
Again women serve women, men serve men. A bit of homemade, 
unleavened bread, a taste of unfermented grape juice, sealed with 
a handshake or a gentle embrace. No one takes the bread and the 
cup who has not washed feet. And so it goes in the mountains of 
eastern Kentucky, western Carolina, and northern Georgia, where 
a people preserve their heritage and reenact it in the present. 
There is a small church in West Virginia where a meeting is going 
bn three to four nights a week, four to six hours a night. The setting 
is the Pentecostal/Holiness tradition, complete with shouting, speak¬ 
ing in tongues, singing, and loud preaching, most of it carried out 
to the beat of a bass guitar, drums, and the omnipresent electric 
organ. It is a lively affair, but on certain nights it gets even livelier. 
For on the floor near the pulpit there is a box, approximately three 
feet long, covered with a screen and padlocked tightly at the top. 
Eleanor Dickinson, in a popular study called Revivalism!, describes 
its purpose: “At some time during the service, usually while music 
and dancing is going on, a preacher will unlock the box, reach in 
and pick up one or more snakes. Anyone in the congregation may 
come forward and reach for a snake if he or she feels moved to 
do so.”2 
Elzie Preast, the late lay pastor of the church, reasoned, “But it 
[the Bible] does say ‘They shall take up serpents,’ and Jesus is the 
one that’s doing the talking. Said, ‘They shall take them up.’ Well, 

============================================================

I’ve got to do it, or somebody’s got to do it, or else Jesus is a 
liar. If we don’t do it, Jesus can raise up a people that will do it.”3 
These are but a few of the images which the words, “mountain 
religion,” bring to mind. Camp meetings, foot washings, snake han¬ 
dling, holy rollers, tongues speaking, tent revivals, loud preaching, 
and emotional exuberance are thought by many to characterize the 
Christianity of the southern highlands. While these qualities of reli¬ 
gious experience are found throughout the region, caricatures and 
stereotypes all too easily become inseparable from reality. This vol¬ 
ume seeks to preserve something of the reality of Appalachian Chris¬ 
tianity as found in the memories of those who experienced that 
religion for themselves. 
No one who knows the Foxfire series needs to be told of the value 
of oral history in preserving the heritage of a people. From the 
first, these books have sought to encourage the young to hear and 
retell the stories of the old, to record the recollections of generations 
whose secrets are almost forgotten, and to describe those profoundly 
simple skills which others have forgotten, take for granted, or ignore. 
From furniture-building to home remedies, from recipes to folklore, 
Foxfire has helped to recount the history of a people in one corner 
of the American nation. 
In these efforts, the religious traditions of Appalachia cannot be 
overlooked. Although occasional articles or limited editions of the 
Foxfire magazine have given some attention to mountain religion, 
the editors believe that a complete volume of the Foxfire books should 
be devoted to this topic. Clearly, this is due to the fact that religion 
has made such a significant impact on Appalachian life. In the harsh 
frontier surroundings religion provided a way of coping with the 
hurts, pains, and disappointments of a sometimes hostile environ¬ 
ment. In the shared events of birth and rebirth, happiness and com¬ 
mon humanity, it was a source of celebration. Through religion a 
people developed symbols to express life’s highest values, reinter¬ 
preting traditional Christian observances and creating new ones. 
The religion described in this collection of reminiscences is the 
product of a variety of influences, biblical and doctrinal, social and 
economic, national and regional. The materials illustrate something 
of the nature of American Christianity as experienced in one geo¬ 
graphical region of the Republic. 

============================================================
PAGE 18
============================================================

The American Christianity: 
Many Churches Under God 
First, American Christianity was characterized by both pluralism 
and uniformity, qualities clearly evident in the interviews provided 
here. With the advent of religious liberty (a freedom not present 
in most of the early colonies), no one denomination or sect could 
demand the allegiance of the entire population. No state could use 
the civil power to coerce attendance at religious services or to secure 
financial support for any religious group. This meant that standard- 
brand denominations, independent-autonomous-noncooperating 
churches, sects, or cults could flourish in the mountains (or else¬ 
where) under the reasonably protective arm of the first amendment 
to the Constitution. Pluralism, then, is that term used to describe 
an American religious community made up of multiple groups, each 
more or less equal under the law. 
Few religious bodies experienced harassment from the state. Snake 
handlers and Jehovah’s Witnesses may have had their share of legal 
problems, but most churches were free to practice their faith without 
government intervention. Thus a multitude of churches, denomina¬ 
tions, and sects appeared in the nation and in the Appalachians. 
As these interviews indicate, freedom of religion led to great diver¬ 
sity in doctrine and practice. Baptism might be by immersion (dip¬ 
ping the whole body in as much water as possible) or by sprinkling 
(touching the head or forehead with a minimal amount of water), 
administered to infants, children, or adults in fonts, creeks, rivers, 
or fiberglass “baptistries” inside the church house with a mural of 
the Jordan River painted in the background. Salvation might be 
immediate and dramatic or quiet and gradual. It might be received 
once and for all, or repeatedly lost and found. For some, only an 
elect minority can be saved, while other churches insist that salvation 
comes to all who freely respond to God through repentance of sin 
and faith in Jesus Christ. 
Pluralism helped to create competition between those churches 
seeking converts from among the same constituents. A group which 
claimed to be the “true” church often felt compelled to prove that 
it was “truer” than other groups making the same claim. Baptists 
debated Methodists and Presbyterians over baptism, while Method¬ 
ists and Presbyterians argued over perseverance of the saints. Such 
competition is illustrated in the comments of the frontier Methodist 
who remarked, “We had a revival meetin’ last week and no one 
was saved. The Baptists down the road had a meeting the same 
week and, thank God, they didn’t save anybody either.” 

============================================================
PAGE 19
============================================================

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 
!7 
These conflicts over doctrine and practice do not obscure the 
uniformity which is also characteristic of both American and southern 
religion. In America until the late nineteenth century, and in the 
South until more recently, Protestantism was the dominant religion. 
There was denominational diversity, but within certain basic Protes¬ 
tant boundaries. 
Although many groups sought to trace their origins to Jesus, the 
New Testament church or even John the Baptist, all shared doctrine 
drawn from the Protestant Reformation and the work of Martin 
Luther, John Calvin, and the radical Anabaptists. Even the influx 
of Catholic and Jewish immigrants, which by the early 1900s had 
created new forces of religious influence in America, had little imme¬ 
diate impact on the Protestant establishment of the South. The au¬ 
thority of the scripture, the centrality of the sermon, the need for 
justification by faith alone, the necessity of individual morality, and 
the presence of a strong inner piety were indicative of the importance 
of the Reformation on common theological views of the American 
Protestant majority. 
Second, the Christianity of Appalachia has been greatly influenced 
by the revivalism which characterizes much of the religious life of 
America. From the Great Awakenings, which swept the colonies in 
the 1740s, to the frontier revivals of the early 1800s to the evange¬ 
listic crusades of the twentieth century, revivalism brought both style 
and substance to American religion. Indeed, revivals established a 
basic form for worship and evangelism in the churches of the moun¬ 
tains. 
Revivals are those outpourings of religious enthusiasm which oc¬ 
cur periodically in the church. Revivalism has been defined as “the 
Protestant ritual (first spontaneous but, since 1830, routinized) in 
which charismatic evangelists convey ‘the Word’ of God to large 
masses of people who, under this influence, experience what Protes¬ 
tants call conversion, salvation, regeneration, or spiritual rebirth.”4 
They seek to bring conversion to those outside the church and re¬ 
newal to those already converted. Revivals might begin spontane¬ 
ously in the ordinary life of the church or grow out of carefully 
organized camp meetings and protracted gatherings. Through reviv¬ 
als, pluralistic churches secured converts to Christianity in general 
and their denomination in particular. Much of the religious life of 
America has been influenced by revivalistic method and theology, 
particularly in those groups—Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Holi¬ 
ness—so prevalent in the southern highlands. 
Revival preaching—loud, dramatic, earnest, lengthy, and sponta¬ 
neous—set the pattern for preaching in most mountain churches.

FOXFIRE 7 
The traveling evangelist, who got results and drew great crowds 
with his (and only occasionally her) charismatic personality, became 
a model which local pastors often had to imitate if they wished to 
retain the respect and attention of their congregations. Sermons 
were taken from scripture but moved hurriedly to contemporary 
hurts, fears, and sins. Conversion was the prime aim of most ser¬ 
mons, as preachers promised the rewards of heaven and threatened 
the fires of hell to those who did not repent. 
Revivals also established a style of worship based on the controlled 
spontaneity of a new type of Protestant liturgy. Hymns were personal 
and vigorous, with religious words set to catchy and popular melo¬ 
dies. Leaders, soloists, or choruses often sang the verses while the 
congregation joined in on the refrain. Hymns taught Bible stories, 
doctrines, and ethics. Some aided the growth of denominational 
identity and competition in the frontier. 
The Methodists sang: 
We’ve searched the law of heaven, 
Throughout the sacred code; 
Of Baptism there by dipping 
We’ve never found a word. 
To plunge is inconsistent 
compared to holy rite; 
an instance of such business 
we’ve never found as yet. 
The Baptists, not to be outdone, responded: 
Not at the Jordan River, 
but in that flowing stream 
stood John the Baptist preacher 
when he baptized Him 
John was a Baptist preacher 
when he baptized the Lamb. 
So Jesus was a Baptist 
And thus the Baptists came.6 
With the preaching and the singing came the congregational in¬ 
volvement: shouts of amen, hallelujah, sometimes glossolalia (speak¬ 
ing in tongues), and other expressions of emotional enthusiasm. 
Converts related the specifics of their salvation experience, while 
penitents confessed their sins. “Altar calls” or “invitations” chal¬ 
lenged the sinner to come to the anxious bench to be “prayed 
through to victory.” Southern churches incorporated these revival

practices in many of their weekly services until the revivalistic style 
became the basic form of worship in many congregations. 
The revivalistic approach to preaching, singing, and salvation 
helped to establish a style of evangelism which came to characterize 
Appalachian religion. Conversion became more immediate and was 
seen as an intimate, personal experience, often quite dramatic in 
nature. It was the response of the heart to the call of God in Christ, 
and it affected all facets of human nature. Sinners were saved “from 
the top of their heads to the tips of their toes,” and if it really 
“took” they were made new creations in every aspect of life. 
A third characteristic of American religion evident in these inter¬ 
views is the concern among many groups to recreate the New Testa¬ 
ment church in the present day. Many churches, denominations, 
and sects came to believe that they had reconstituted, restored, or 
rediscovered the true practices and doctrines of the primitive Chris¬ 
tian community.6 
The new American land, so long undiscovered by European Chris¬ 
tians, seemed the place which providence had prepared for the resto¬ 
ration of New Testament Christianity. Here, unpolluted by the 
trappings of popery, the worldliness, and the immorality of Europe, 
the church could blossom again. This was the “New Israel,” the 
City set upon a Hill to provide light to all the nations. Optimism 
about America’s place in the reestablishment of biblical Christianity 
likewise influenced the relationship of religion and nationalism in 
Appalachia and throughout the country. 
American religion, pluralistic, Protestant, revivalistic, competitive, 
and restorationist, provided trends and tendencies which shaped 
significantly the Christianity of Appalachia. These interviews reflect 
some of those trends as they were uniquely developed in the south¬ 
ern highlands. 
SOUTHERN CHRISTIANITY: 
THE RELIGION OF A CULTURE 
The religion of Appalachia was also greatly influenced by the 
Christianity of the American South. This Bible Belt religion per¬ 
meated the social and cultural life of the region, defining more 
sharply the nature of Christianity in America. While there were many 
denominations in the South, southern religion was shaped by what 
might be called the Baptist/Methodist religious establishment. 
The Baptists were everywhere, in all kinds of churches with diverse 
doctrines and varying practices. Southern, Independent, Missionary, 
Regular, Separate, and Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit-Predestinarian Bap-

tists (to name only a few) might vie for the souls of the southerners, 
but all were Baptists, and the Baptists had southern religion sewed 
up (or washed up as their opponents might suggest). 
Add to that the Methodists, with their ubiquitous circuit riders, 
and the religion of southern Appalachia was almost complete, except 
for an occasional Presbyterian or Disciple of Christ. When the Pente- 
costals arrived they found a welcome reception among some moun¬ 
tain folk but also some strong opposition when their enthusiasm 
for tongues and healing created disturbances outside the religious 
boundaries set by other southern Protestants. In earlier days, the 
Catholics and Episcopalians did not often fare much better if they 
challenged the more revivalistic establishment. 
Southern religion also reflects intensity in its concern for faith, 
morality, and evangelism. Southern Christians often seem to believe 
more, and believe more intensely, than many groups outside the 
South. Southerners generally reflect more conservative theology, 
with a commitment to the “unchanging” truths of the faith. The 
religious establishment in the South often places its greatest stress 
on the need for personal salvation, the unflinching allegiance to 
certain crucial doctrines, and the importance of a rigorous personal 
morality. 
All persons need salvation and the whole society, indeed, the 
whole world, must hear the “old, old story of Jesus and his love.” 
Evangelism and missions thus occupy a major place in southern 
religious activities. Through door-to-door witnessing, radio evangel¬ 
ism, or missionaries sent abroad, the southern churches give evi¬ 
dence of their concern for personal evangelism. The need to “snatch 
souls fyom the burning,” bring all the world to faith in Christ, and 
take the gospel to all nations has long been an imperative for south¬ 
ern evangelicals. 
The proof of genuine conversion is found in a distinctive Christian 
lifestyle and, thus, personal morality is another strong concern of 
southern churches. Separation from the world and uniqueness in 
morals, dress, and attitude are important evidences of Christian dis- 
cipleship. Campaigns for moral reform and civic decency have fre¬ 
quently united southern Protestants beyond doctrinal differences. 
Crusades against gambling, tobacco, alcohol, and prostitution have 
produced some of the strongest ecumenical activities of southern 
churches. 
Not all groups, however, can agree on what constitutes Christian 
morality. Differences over the use of makeup and jewelry by women, 
movies, dancing, television, and music are common among southern 
churches and denominations.

Another important force within southern religion is fundamental¬ 
ism. While that particular theological orientation is certainly not 
limited to the South, it has been a major influence upon the doctrines 
and practices of the southern churches. Fundamentalism is not 
unique to one denomination, but appears to varying degrees in many 
southern religious groups. It represents that effort to establish a 
set of unchanging propositions or doctrines which are absolutely 
“fundamental” to Christian faith. 
Fundamentalism, as a movement in America, has often been asso¬ 
ciated with that period of the 1920s when questions of biblical au¬ 
thority, theory of evolution, and science threw the churches into 
an uproar, culminating in the infamous Scopes’ Monkey Trial held 
in Dayton, Tennessee, in the summer of 1925. Those events have 
served more to caricature the fundamentalism which existed both 
before and after the controversies of the twenties. 
Fundamentalists in the South represent no clearly organized 
movement, and many of their number would disagree vehemently 
over which set of doctrines is most fundamental. The force of funda¬ 
mentalism may have less to do with specific doctrines than with 
the way in which fundamentalists approach religious truth. 
First, fundamentalists often have difficulty separating the reality 
of genuine religious experience from the need to believe certain 
basic propositions about the gospel. They are convinced that one 
cannot be called Christian who does not affirm the truth of a wide 
variety of necessary articles of the faith. 
Second, fundamentalists usually insist that any deviation from es¬ 
sential doctrines represents a compromise of the truth. There is 
one truth, one way, and compromise is a sign of weakness in the 
faith and a betrayal of the gospel. There are no shades of wrong 
or right, no half-truth concerning God. Doubts about one proposi¬ 
tion will surely weaken the structure of all doctrines. 
Third, once the basic propositions are affirmed the individual has 
the answers, or at least the formula, for dealing with whatever cir¬ 
cumstances life may bring. The fundamental foundation of the faith 
thus provides a secure base upon which the believer may stand in 
confronting the struggles of life. One may not know all the truth, 
but the principles by which truth can be known have been discovered 
and accepted. 
Fourth, although there are many different doctrines accepted by 
a variety of fundamentalist Christians, the common dogma, essential 
to all others, is found in the fundamentalist interpretation of biblical 
authority. Whether the doctrine is baptismal immersion (indepen¬ 
dent Baptist), baptism “for the remission of sins” (Church of Christ), 

============================================================

speaking in an unknown tongue (Pentecostals), or taking up serpents 
(snake handlers), if the scripture is not trustworthy on one doctrine, 
how can it be trustworthy on any? Most modem fundamentalists 
would insist that scripture holds within it no contradictions, errors, 
or “mistakes” and is the infallible, inerrant word of God. Modern 
versions of the Bible may contain errors, copying mistakes, or mis¬ 
translations; no such problems exist in the original, but no longer 
extant, manuscripts of the scripture. The concern for doctrinal purity 
in translations of scripture has placed many fundamentalists, espe¬ 
cially in Appalachia, on the side of the King James Version and 
against the use of any one of many modern translations from the 
Revised Standard Version (a particular anathema) to the paraphrased 
Living Bible (somewhat more acceptable among certain groups). The 
KJV, published in England in 1611, is thought to represent the 
best text for the church and is often considered as inspired as the 
original Hebrew and Greek texts. As one classic line has it, “If the 
King James Version was good enough for the Apostle Paul, it’s 
good enough for me.” 
In addition to biblical inerrancy, fundamentalists will likely affirm 
the following essential doctrines: the reality of the Genesis accounts 
of creation; Adam and Eve as the genuine “parents of the race”; 
the virgin birth of Christ; the substitutionary or sacrificial atonement 
of Christ; the bodily resurrection of Christ; the literal second coming 
of Christ; the reality of Christ’s miracles as described in the gospels. 
Finally, fundamentalists often display a tendency to speak infallibly 
on matters of faith and morals. This has frequently led preachers, 
revivalists, and church members to consign to hell those who did 
not accept “the plain truth” of one group’s particular ideas. 
Fundamentalism is alive and well in twentieth-century Appalachia. 
It shapes churches, sometimes splits them, and keeps them arguing 
with friends. 
Fundamentalism informs but does not completely dominate an¬ 
other significant facet of southern religious life: the need for personal 
religious experience. This process begins with conversion, but it 
is more than that, since continued encounter with God is absolutely 
necessary for vital Christian witness throughout the life of the indi¬ 
vidual. In the revivalistic churches of the South, conversion—inti¬ 
mate experience with God through Christ—is the rite of passage 
into both the kingdom of God and community of the church. No 
one who has failed to experience Christ personally can be fully ac¬ 
cepted into Christian society. Thus, conversion carries with it both 
eternal and temporal ramifications. The imperative for conversion 
of every person is the central theme of much of the preaching in

southern and Appalachian churches. For the evangelical preacher 
there are two types of people, the saved and the lost, those on 
their way to heaven or hell, with no middle ground in between. 
As Billy Sunday insisted: 
You are going to live in heaven or you are going to live forever 
in hell. There’s no other place—-just the two. It is for you to 
decide. It’s up to you and you must decide now.7 
The preachers, therefore, are called primarily to awaken the lost 
to their need of salvation. Sermons focus on the state of the individ¬ 
ual before God, the evil of the human heart, the promises of heaven 
and the threat of hell. More “modern” evangelists often emphasize 
the joys of the Christian life, the rewards of the saved, and the 
triumph of heaven, much to the chagrin of the “old-fashioned” 
preachers, who continue to paint vivid pictures of the torment of 
a literal, burning, fiery hell, “where the worm dieth not and the 
fire is not quenched.” (Mark 9:44) 
The way of salvation varies in southern churches. In some, it is 
a process of nurture, growth, and confirmation. In others, it is a 
dramatic event characterized by emotional upheaval as the sinner 
turns from sin and the world to the forgiveness and love of Christ. 
The process of this life-changing experience may be brief or lengthy, 
depending on the preacher, the church, or the individual. It includes 
a recognition of sinfulness, a deep sorrow for sin, a turning from 
sin to the mercy of God (repentance), an acceptance of Jesus Christ 
as the sacrifice whereby sins are forgiven with a direct invitation 
to Christ to “come into” the human heart and take control of the 
life. In many southern churches it is essential that the converted 
know the exact time—day, hour, moment—when salvation occurred. 
Failure to know such a time may mean that the experience was 
invalid and the process must be repeated. 
following conversion, the newly converted individual must con¬ 
tinue to grow in grace and know successive experiences with God. 
In some individuals, this may result in a second decisive experience: 
the baptism of the Holy Ghost, whereby the Christian is sanctified 
for holiness of life. In this event, particularly important in the Pente¬ 
costal/Holiness tradition, the believer is empowered by the Spirit 
to live the life of Christ daily. Many believe that the sign of this 
“second baptism” is the gift of unknown tongues. This experience 
is discussed further in the section on Pentecostalism. 
Another pivotal religious experience, frequently described in these 
interviews, is the “call to preach.” This is a moment of crisis in 
which particular (primarily male) believers are singled out for “the 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
greatest of all callings,” the proclamation of the gospel. For many, 
this occurrence is more powerful than conversion. Sometimes the 
call comes by means of an audible voice, accompanied by a bright 
light or a dramatic vision. In many cases, the person fights against 
the call as the last possible vocation into which he (sometimes she) 
should go. In fact, in many churches, the harder the preacher fights 
the call the more authentic is the experience. 
Personal religious experience is a non-negotiable requirement in 
most evangelistic southern churches. As the accounts provided here 
indicate, the experiences, while varied, have many common ele¬ 
ments. Visions, voices, dreams, and emotional upheavals are not 
uncommon. In these occurrences, the principles of scripture are 
internalized: The individual passes from light to darkness and ac¬ 
knowledges the reality of inner religious truth. 
The type of religion reflected in these interviews is unique, less 
because its qualities are evident only in the South, than because 
its influence uniquely permeates the culture of the southern Bible 
Belt. In many sections of the South, religion serves as a dynamic 
force for social control and influence. To be southern is to be reli¬ 
gious, Christian, Protestant, Baptist, or Methodist. The religion re¬ 
flected in this book is southern. But it is also Appalachian and that 
involves other qualities and characteristics. 
APPALACHIAN CHRISTIANITY: 
PLURALISM IN THE MOUNTAINS 
Although greatly influenced by religious trends in America and 
in the South, Appalachian religion also developed its own unique 
qualities. First, the relative isolation of the region helped insulate 
the churches from many forces of social and theological change. 
The religion established by the early settlers was probably preserved 
longer in the remote mountain areas than in the more accessible 
urban centers of the nation. Isolation often retarded cooperation 
between churches and limited the exchange of divergent ideas. Isola¬ 
tion contributed to the conservatism of the churches and the ten¬ 
dency to view local religious traditions as closest to those of the 
New Testament. It also helped succeeding generations to have a 
secure religious heritage and an identity as Christian believers. 
Second, the geographical isolation, theological conservatism, and 
rugged individualism of mountain life helped create a spirit of inde¬ 
pendence in the churches. Independent churches with no connec¬ 
tions outside the local body were often the norm in Appalachian 
religious life. 

============================================================

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

Many churches were founded by traveling evangelists and then 
guided by lay preachers who lived in the community. This was partic¬ 
ularly true of Baptist and Holiness churches where local autonomy 
and congregational government meant that congregations could be 
founded independent of boards, presbyteries, or bishops. Even those 
mountain churches with some denominational affiliation frequently 
reflect a greater concern for autonomy than for strict adherence 
to the procedures and recommendations of the parent body. 
The subjective nature of faith, the independent spirit, and the 
local church structure also provide a context in which church dis¬ 
putes and divisions are common. Much of the diversity of mountain 
religion is related to the many church “splits,” which occur and 
from which new congregations are founded. Appalachian churches 
often illustrate the old adage that Christian denominations “multiply 
by dividing.” 
A third influence upon the religion of Appalachia is found in 
the folk ways of the mountains. Mountain traditions, music, stories, 
and lifestyle were important factors in shaping the religious expe¬ 
rience of the region. Those biblical images compatible with the hard¬ 
ships and benefits of mountain life were particularly evident in the 
preaching and worship of the churches. Folk singing with a guitar 
rather than the organ worked its way into Appalachian hymnody. 
Deliverance from the drudgery of hard work, escape from poverty, 
and the assurance of a better world to come are common themes 
in the sermons of many preachers. The people of the mountains 
interpret Christian faith in ways compatible with their own experi¬ 
ence and struggles. 
As Appalachian religion developed its own unique expressions, 
it also created new symbols and reinterpreted existing ones. The 
churches established new traditions and invested local customs with 
religious significance. The walking of the aisle or altar call came 
to symbolize conversion in the life of an individual. The conversion 
experience itself was often referred to as “walking the aisle,” “com¬ 
ing forward,” or “coming down to the front” (of the church). 
The fellowship meal, the personal testimony, the right hand of 
Christian brotherhood, the experience of speaking in tongues, and 
other common events held symbolic as well as concrete meaning 
in different churches and communities. These symbols spoke beyond 
words to give identity and security to congregations and denomina¬ 
tions. 
The interviews provided here illustrate the way in which religion 
and lifestyle interact in the southern highlands of America. They 
represent an effort to preserve what might be called “peoples his-

tory,” the perception of religion and its place in society as under¬ 
stood by the people who practice it daily. This is not religion as 
articulated in precise theological formulas and dogmas. It is the 
description of faith as lived out by the practitioners in what some 
might describe as the “grass roots” of the church. 
This is history as oral tradition and popular recollection, discov¬ 
ered as a people describe those beliefs, symbols, and observances 
which offer them a sense of value, meaning, and a place in the 
society of Appalachia. The memories of baptism, sermons, conver¬ 
sions, and revival meetings speak volumes about the way in which 
religion is perceived by the people who have chosen it. 
Appalachian Christianity has also had its own particular stereo¬ 
types, which, in the popular mind, identify all religion in the region. 
Ignorant preachers, holy rollers, snake handlers, radio evangelists, 
and barefoot believers worshipping in log churches are among those 
images which often caricature the religion of the southern highlands. 
True, there are certain forms which fit the stereotypes and these 
interviews reflect some of those popular experiences. But the inter¬ 
views also reveal that there are many other expressions of religion 
which go beyond the caricatures. Not all the preachers, for example, 
are uneducated. Nor does the lack of formal education imply the 
absence of learning among many mountain clergy who are self- 
taught in matters of scripture, history, and theology. The obsession 
of mountain churches for individual conversion and a rigorous per¬ 
sonal ethic does not necessarily indicate a lack of commitment to 
social action or political involvement. Holy roller is no longer (if 
it ever was) an appropriate designation for the people of the Pente¬ 
costal/Holiness tradition. Neither is snake handling the extensive 
practice which modem media coverage might suggest. 
Furthermore, not all the people of Appalachia express their faith 
through some form of organized religion. Many have little interest 
in any form of religion at all. While Christianity has a strong influence 
on mountain society, many persons appear to get along quite well 
without benefit of clergy. These obvious unbelievers need not expect 
to practice their unbelief in peace. As the known and hardened 
sinners of the community, they are often the object of pastors, laity, 
and traveling evangelists, who seek to move them from the broad 
way of destruction to the narrow way of eternal life. The stereotypes 
and their contradictions frequently exist side by side in the moun¬ 
tains. 
Finally, the religion which developed in Appalachia is in transition. 
As a more mobile, more secular generation moves in and out of

the mountains, the changes created affect all facets of life, including 
religion. 
Those who remember need to tell their story while they are able. 
The children of this new era may well have forgotten, repudiated, 
or reinterpreted the practices and traditions of the past. They need 
to be reminded of those events which shaped the faith of their fore¬ 
bears. Students of American religion may find these accounts helpful 
in preserving another facet of history and religion of Appalachia. 
As “outsiders” with new religious traditions move into the region, 
they need to become aware of the heritage of religion which has 
preceded them, whether they accept it or not. 
For American religious pluralism no longer applies exclusively 
to the Judeo-Christian religious establishment. Indeed, it may be 
that in contemporary Appalachia, “Hare Krishna” will one day sound 
across hills and hollers where only hallelujahs have been heard be¬ 
fore.

I’d rather be a Baptist 
and eat that Baptist pie! 
Nationally, there are at least fifty different religious groups who 
call thejnselves Baptists. This collectively large denomination there¬ 
fore is extremely diverse and, except for a few important and central 
beliefs, can rarely agree on religious doctrine. One main reason 
for this diversity is the Baptists’ strong belief in autonomy, especially 
at the local church level. Even in the more structured subgroups 
of Baptists, much emphasis is placed on allowing each individual 
church to choose much of its policy and to chart much of its own 
direction. This sometimes sets the stage for disagreement among 
members of a particular church and it is not uncommon for other 
churches or types of Baptists to be conceived from these disagree¬ 
ments. 
As a group, the Baptists are a strong force in the mountains. In 
addition, large subgroups, such as the Southern Baptists are also 
greatly appealing and attract many followers on their own. These 
interviews represent Baptist diversity and strength, and included 
are those who present the views of Southern, Independent, Free 
Will, Primitive, and Black Baptists. As you read this section, be mind¬ 
ful of common threads of Baptist theological belief, but look for 
specific differences that make the types of Baptists so unique.

BEN COOK, Southern Baptist 
The old horseback-riding circuit preachers of yesteryear have their own special 
place in both religious history and folklore. To me, they have already etched 
themselves into legend along with other grand and glorious once-upon-a-time 
characters such that settled these mountains and made them their home. And 

============================================================
PAGE 31
============================================================

I’m sure that the old circuit riders were a special group of men in terms of 
boldness and dedication—to arise from bed early on a January Saturday or 
Sunday morning and greet the dawn along with a howling north wind and 
journey ten to fifteen or more miles over treacherous, icy, rock-strewn mountain 
trails to conduct services. And I’m positive that it would take a more brave 
soul than myself to conduct an evening service that same Saturday or Sunday 
in still a different location and then journey home on foot or horseback through 
the inky blackness of virtual wilderness forests and thickets. 
One of the preachers who remembered riding these circuits was Reverend 
Ben Cook, a Southern Baptist preacher from the mountains offackson County, 
North Carolina. The son of a preacher, Mr. Floyd Cook, and one of nine 
children, Ben was bom in the Caney Fork section of that same county. In 
fact, until his death in February 1979, Reverend Cook had lived in that 
part of western North Carolina for all but three of his eighty-three years. 
Reverend Cook was a preacher for the better part of five decades and pastored 
in over twenty churches. During these years, he conducted many revivals and 
other special services and, even in his retirement, he accepted speaking engage¬ 
ments and preached when he was called on. Reverend and Mrs. Cook raised 
a large family of seven who gave them fifteen grandchildren and fourteen 
great-grandchildren. 
During the few years we were fortunate enough to know Ben, he helped 
us immensely with our study of mountain religion. He provided us with enter¬ 
taining, moving, and informative material, and also helped us to arrange 
an interview with another retired Baptist minister. It was from him and his 
congregation that we obtained permission to document a foot-washing service 
at his church.

Every time Paul Gillespie, our advisor, and Wendy Guyaux (a fellow student 
who has worked with me on this project) and I had the opportunity to visit, 
Ben was always more than willing to sit and talk with us, show us something 
of importance and just plain help us any way he could. Personally, I hope 
that this story, told in his own words, can capture, in some way, a part of 
the spirit of this great man of God. 
KEITH HEAD 
I was about, I guess, sixteen years old [when I became a Christian]. 
You know, back then they believed in waiting ’til they got up [in 
age]. My father was a minister and he and old Frank Arrington 
was in a revival meeting at John’s Creek. It was a school building 
back then and I went there—me and my brother and Ham Mash— 
we were all converted at the same time. I was about sixteen years 
old and I got under conviction. I wanted to be saved but I wanted 
it to be done in secret [to] see if I could live right. Then I’d tell 
it. I found out you can’t do it that way. [I] prayed all week and 
was under conviction. I got to feeling good but I wasn’t satisfied. 
I went there to the altar at John’s Creek, an old school building, 
and down under a seat—they had those old time seats there in 
the school building—I don’t know what happened but there was a 
light that shone, brighter than the sun. It shone from the top of 
my head all over me and everything was just as white as snow. 
The congregation looked like angels, and the people that I hated, 
why, they were the first ones that I put my arm around. The people 
that I’d called hypocrites back when I was a sinner were the first 
that I got a’hold to and I loved them. I shouted all over the church— 
I don’t know what happened. It took a long time before I realized 
what had happened. Before I got home the devil tried to make me 
doubt it and he tried to make me believe that it was just excitement, 
but I prayed and the Lord gave me a sign that I was saved. My 
brother was saved, too, in the same meeting, and we joined the 
Balsam Grove Baptist Church and were both baptized together. Ham 
Mash professed religion that night and Lem Parker, an old man, 
was saved the same night. We were all baptized out there in the 
creek. 
I never did doubt my salvation. I was down under a bench when 
I was saved. I had to give up everything, I had to forget everything, 
I had to die to everything. When I was born of the Holy Spirit of 
God, it shone all over me and through me. It made me love everyone. 
That’s my beginning.

BAPTISTS 
How did you feel led to be a preacher ? 
My father was a minister. I felt impressed to preach; I was bur¬ 
dened to preach. [My father] took sick, took pneumonia fever. I 
went and prayed and asked the Lord that if I was called to preach, 
I wanted to be certain because it was a great burden to start out 
in the world. I’d heard so many hard things said about preachers. 
I dreaded the thought of preaching. I asked the Lord that if I was 
called to preach to let my father tell me before he died. Just before 
he died the pneumonia fever broke, his heart got weak, and he 
called me into his room. He said, “Do you know you’re called to 
preach?” 
And I denied it and said, “No, I didn’t know it.” 
He said, “You are,” and then he died in a little bit. 
For a year I tried to keep from preaching. I just didn’t want to 
preach. I was out in the mountain, fox hunting with a bunch of 
people, and I was so burdened. They went up on the mountain 
and I said, “I’ll stay here with the horses and if I get better—I 
told them I had a headache—I’ll come up there and hear the race. 
So that night—I don’t know whether I was asleep or awake—I saw 
the angels and Jesus Christ. He said, “You were called to preach 
and you won’t do it.” And He said, “It’s too late. It’s over.” I believe 
I’d’ve died that night if I hadn’t agreed to preach. I told the Lord 
that night that if I lived to the next Sunday, I’d preach. The next 
Sunday I preached in a little church, Cathan’s Chapel, my first ser¬ 
mon. I don’t know how long I preached. The Spirit of the Lord 
just absolutely took over. I believe you’ve got to be led by the Spirit 
of God to preach a gospel sermon that will have an effect on people. 
The Spirit of God has to carry the message to the hearts of people. 
My mother pulled me off the pulpit shouting when I preached 
my first sermon. I guess it was as good a sermon as I ever preached 
in my life. I’d conducted funerals [before]. My father was the only 
preacher that lived up there on the head of Caney Fork. He pastored 
[several] churches up there. There wasn’t anybody that could con¬ 
duct funerals. I’d conducted funerals and I’d been a deacon a long 
time in the church before I was called to preach. I could lead prayer, 
that wasn’t any trouble to do that. When I got ready to preach, I 
just got up and read some scripture and took a text, and then I 
don’t know what else happened. The spirit of the Lord just took 
over.

I prayed. I read and prayed. Now I think that a man ought to 
prepare himself and to do everything he can to prepare, and then 
to trust the Lord like he didn’t know anything. Because if God doesn’t 
give you a message, it won’t amount to anything. I used to wonder 
why we didn’t get dying grace now. Everyone would like to have 
it. You’d like to have it, but you don’t need it. God told Paul, “My 
grace is sufficient.” You need living grace now. And when you get 
sick, you need grace for sickness. Then when you come to death, 
you need dying grace. Now the preacher can read, pray, and do 
everything else. He won’t get preaching grace until the very moment 
he gets in that pulpit. When he gets in there and it comes time 
for him to have that grace, it comes. I get scared to death lots of 
times. I’ve had to preach to large churches and great congregations 
of people. The thing about it—you’ve got to turn yourself loose 
to the Lord. There are lots of people that try to do it themselves. 
You can’t preach yourself. The Holy Spirit will lead if you let it. 
Is preaching something you have to be “called” by the Lord to do? 
Certainly. I don’t believe anybody could preach unless they were 
called. That’s the Divine Call. I went to the preacher’s schools; I 
went to Raleigh, and I went one year to college up here at Cullowhee. 
Then I tried to get all the books so that I could prepare myself to 
preach and I’ve had good success. Yes, that’s a Divine Call. The 
only way a preacher could succeed is to be called by the Lord. I 
believe in heartfelt religion. I think that there’s too many, probably, 
that are trying to preach that are not called to preach. 
What was it like when you first started out? 
I went on horseback. There weren’t any automobiles back when 
I first started. I rode across the mountains into Canada [North Caro¬ 
lina], right over there close to where that Bly Owens [another moun¬ 
tain preacher] lived. That was before he ever preached. I’d go there 
and preach at Saul’s Creek in the morning on Saturday. We had 
Saturday meetings back then. I’d preach there and then I’d go on 
to Wolf Creek ten miles away and preach in the evening. Then 
the next rhoming, I’d get up there and preach at eleven o’clock 
and then come back to Saul’s Creek to preach [in the evening]. 
Then I’d go home. That was more than twenty miles. Back then I 
went and [sometimes] it had rained all day or snowed all day. It 
looked like it would kill you to cross that mountain and go and 
preach. That’s when I began preaching. You never did get sick from 
that.

I’d ride across the mountain to Caney Fork [also]. Then I began 
pastoring churches [regularly]. I pastored Tuckaseegee and Yellow 
Mountain and Cedar. Then I came down to Lovedale and was pastor 
there for twelve years. Then I was elected to Balsam Church up 
here next to the Haywood [County] line. I preached there twenty- 
one years and built that church down there; it was called Pleasant 
Balsam. We built that back during the Depression. Then I went 
from there down to Richland, near Waynesville, North Carolina, 
and pastored there for five or six years. I’ve pastored about twenty- 
one churches in my fifty-four years [of preaching]. I’ve baptized 
about thirty-five hundred people in my life. I can’t tell you how 
many I’ve married. 
When I started out, I had good success with churches and revival 
meetings. I think I’ve been an evangelistic preacher all the time 
I’ve run revival meetings and got acquainted with the churches. 
[When] I pastored up at Tuckaseegee, we had a great meeting up 
there. We had a revival meeting that went on a month. When we 
started there hadn’t been a meeting there in years with any success. 
Me and Lawrence Crawford preached together. Lawrence was a one- 
armed preacher; he’s been dead for several years. We started a meet¬ 
ing there and he stayed one week and went home. He said it wasn’t 
doing any good. The second week a little child died and I attended 
the funeral. Then the Wesleyan Methodists had a woman minister 
over there and she died. Then a Parker woman, Matt Parker’s sister, 
died. [There were] three deaths there in three days and that started 
a revival meeting. Sometimes the Lord has to preach in other ways. 
He’s got to prepare [people] to hear. He said that “all things work 
together for good to them that love the Lord.” Sometimes it takes 
death to open the door for the gospel. 
We went from house to house and there were thirty-eight baptized 
in that revival meeting. When I baptized there, there was so much 
ice floating—it was in the wintertime—that I’d have to wait for the 
big sheets of ice to get over to keep from hurting [the people being 
baptized]. They saic} I’d freeze to death, but I baptized thirty-eight 
and I came out and wasn’t too cold. You know, I’ve never heard 
of anybody taking a cold being baptized. There’s something about 
it. Of course, it’s the Lord. 
I remember back when I was a young preacher and running a 
revival meeting, every church up in there would come. They’d every 
one come to the revival meeting. They would just run a house over. 
The yard would be full of people. You know, people had time to 
read the Bible. They didn’t have all these amusements we have

today. The only thing they had was the Bible. They believed in 
the Bible and they had time to get acquainted with each other. We’re 
living in such a fast age of the world [now] that it seems like people 
don’t have time to get acquainted with each other. Back when my 
father was a minister, when somebody came that he knew—maybe 
he was hoeing corn—he’d just stop and sit down and talk three or 
four hours or half a day and they’d eat dinner. The com was in 
weeds, but he’d just talk all day with people. They had plenty of 
time to get acquainted. They loved each other better. 
I remember when my father was sick. He had Bright’s disease 
and they had to go to Waynesville, North Carolina, and get a doctor 
and bring him across the mountain. He’d swell so big and they 
had to come here and draw the water out of him. He looked like 
he was going to die. [The neighbors] that summer made us the 
best crop that we ever had. They came in here and planted the 
corn, helped hoe it and gather it. That was love. 
They’d have workings and they’d clean off land, great fields of 
land. They’d pile [brush] and bum it. They’d have what you call 
corn shuckings and come in and shuck out a man’s com. Then 
they would come on and have bean stringings and all like that. 
[The people] were all together—united together. And at the first 
meeting that I ran at Balsam Grove when I was a young preacher, 
we had two services—one of a morning and one of an evening. 
[The people] quit doing anything [for two weeks]. They just cooked 
and ate. That’s all they would do until that meeting was over with. 
The women had their place where they had prayer meeting and I 
had about eight or ten men up on a hill. They were people that 
couldn’t get right with the church and I took them up on the moun¬ 
tain. I remember there were six or seven that professed religion 
there on that hill and they shouted all over top of that hill. It was 
a rough hill and I can show you it today. We didn’t do anything 
until that service was over. You know, if people could use two weeks 
[like that] in the year—God lets you have the rest of the time except 
two weeks—drop everything and serve the Lord. What would you 
think that would do for the churches? 
When they ran this [revival] meeting down here at Lovedale, we 
started by having singing. We’d ask people and I got them to come 
from Knoxville, Tennessee and all around. We had loudspeakers 
on the church out there at Lovedale, and on Sunday morning we’d 
play some of those old hymns over the loudspeakers and they could 
hear it all over the country. We’d play these old hymns like “Amazing 
Grace’’ and that’d draw people out. We got about two hundred

and fifty over there in Sunday school; didn’t take too long. I’d go 
every Sunday morning and preach and sing for thirty minutes, and 
I’d advertise revival meeting over the radio; announced it. Then 
we’d get singers from everywhere. We’d make them a collection. 
That singing helped to get a congregation of people. Then revival 
started and I don’t know what happened. 
It was the greatest thing. I preached out there a month and two 
nights and I’d say that we averaged fifteen hundred people every 
night. They were blocked all around that church and they were 
even down into the highway. They came from four or five counties 
here, and it was the biggest meeting I guess that’s ever been held 
in Jackson County. Me and Bill Crawford baptized ninety-one there 
in the river at one time. The Spirit of God just lit up that whole 
hilltop there. While I was preaching on the inside, Hombuckle, an 
Indian down there at Cherokee, was outside preaching. They had 
lots of conversions on the outside of the church and up in the ceme¬ 
tery. The Spirit of God came down. Lost people’d just come to 
the altar. That’s the mountain peak, I feel like, in my life because 
I reached the high up there. 
There’s a time when people really want a revival. You know, there’s 
a time, He said, to do all things. You can’t have a revival meeting 
unless the church wants it. I’ve thought of it in that way. Let the 
church get ready for [a] revival meeting. I think you ought to plan 
ahead and pray. I believe in starting a revival meeting with a prayer 
meeting—having a prayer meeting for about a week before you begin 
a revival. 
One time I was up on Caney Fork—just a country preacher up 
there—and they voted over there at the First Baptist Church in 
Hazelwood, North Carolina, for me to hold a revival meeting. 
The preacher came over and said, “The church, Sunday night, 
voted for you to conduct a revival meeting down here at the First 
Baptist Church in Hazelwood.” 
I said, “I’m just a little country boy. I feel like that’s too great a 
burden for me.” I said, “You go home and I’ll pray until tomorrow 
evening.” I said, “If the Lord gives me a burden, I’ll be there. If 
He doesn’t give me a burden, I’ll not be there.” 
I prayed until the next evening. I got a burden and I went over 
there. I believe it was fifty-some odd were baptized because of that 
meeting there in Hazelwood. I went back a year or two later and 
baptized forty-eight. I baptized over one hundred people into that 
church there in two revival meetings. I suppose that most of their 
old members [were the ones] I baptized there.

I ran a meeting [in Macon County]—a revival over near Rainbow 
Springs where the old sawmill was. I’ve also preached down there 
when they were off for noon dinner. I’d preach there at the mill— 
me and Joe Bishop. We’d go on the mountain and pray. That was 
a shouting meeting. The superintendent of that job was the singing 
leader. Lord, he’d shout! 
One fellow there made fun of the people. They had a bad mountain 
to go down with their lumber. They’d stop their train there and 
they’d have prayer before they’d turn over the mountain because 
it was dangerous and steep. And this brakeman made fun of them 
having prayer. He got under conviction there in that revival meeting 
and he couldn’t be saved, but one day they stopped their engine 
to pray before they turned over the mountain and he got religion 
there. He was called to preach after that. He had to go right where 
he’d made fun of those fellows praying. That was the most religious 
company I’ve ever seen—Ritter Lumber Company. They really did 
support that revival. I could go out for dinner with people and 
they had a place for me to stay every night. The company arranged 
that. That was during the Depression. When the revival was over 
with they gave me a hundred dollars in an envelope and that sounded 
like a whole lot of money back in those days! 
When I first started out like that, I went into 'a community and 
I stayed there until the revival meeting was over with. I didn’t go 
back home. It seemed like that if you got out away from that church 
so far, you’d get out of the spirit and it was better to stay among 
the people and work with them. 
What took place when somebody came to get saved? 
They’d get down on their knees and come weeping. I believe 
that you’ve got to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit. The 
gospel and the Holy Spirit convicts a man of sin and when he’s 
convicted—I’ve seen them come falling into the altar, crying for 
the mercy of God. Let them stay there until they get right with 
God. And when they get right with God, they’ll endure the end. 
One night we had a meeting that had been going nine weeks 
and there were about fifteen or twenty on the altar and no one 
had been saved. A little boy, seven or eight years old, had been 
coming to the altar every night; no one would invite him, but he’d 
come. Everyone thought he was too little to be saved, to be accounta¬ 
ble. I didn’t pay any attention to him and I’d always go to the moun¬ 
tain top and pray before I would come to preach on Sunday night. 
I was up there praying and all I could see was that little boy on 

============================================================

that altar. And something said to me, “Have you ever instructed 
him?” 
I said, “No, I haven’t and no one else has either.” 
So I went back that night and old Uncle Abe Norman was the 
preacher. It was his grandson. I was praying and all I could see 
was this little boy. I said, “I don’t know, he might be closer to 
death than any of these men here.” You know, they all came up 
and got around that little boy and he was saved. Then there was 
ten or fifteen saved just about as fast as they could come up, after 
he was saved. I baptized that little boy down there in the river and 
that following week he was killed over there on the highway with 
a car. That taught me that God knows His business. I baptized him 
down there in the river and that following week he was killed and 
I attended his funeral over there. That little boy had that whole 
thing tied up there. God knows. That little boy was closer to death 
and closer to hell than those old men were. Things like that have 
helped me along life’s way. You know, the Spirit will lead you if 
you let it. When it tells you to do a thing, it’s right. I don’t care— 
you don’t need to argue with it. 
How do you feel about snake handling? 
I was pastor of a church up there at Yellow Mountain when there 
was a preacher up there that believed in the handling of snakes. I 
knew about that. He tried to make a big show of it, you know, but 
I don’t believe in tempting God. I think that those things are danger¬ 
ous. I don’t think Paul knew that that serpent was in there when 
he picked up [wood] to build that fire, but when it got warm, it 
thawed up and bit him. They thought he’d die but he didn’t. He 
shook it off. Now this preacher up here on the Cullowhee Mountain— 
I was pastor up there at Yellow Mountain not too far from where 
he was—told them to bring a snake on Sunday night and he would 
handle it. There were two guys there and I don’t think that they 
had the right kind of spirit. They caught a rattlesnake and deviled 
it all week just to make it ill. It would strike at everything, you 
know. They took it in and took it out and it bit [the preacher]. He 
threw it down on the floor and they told him to pick it up and it 
bit him again. I do know that they used all the medicine that they 
could find on that fellow and it liked to have killed him. 
Do you believe in shouting? 
I believe in shouting. I think pride has just almost killed the Spirit 
of God [and people don’t shout much any more]. My mother shouted 
as long as she lived. When Jesus Christ comes back to earth again,

He’s coming with a great shout. Isn’t He? David said* “Let them 
shout from the tops of the mountains.” I think we’ve got something 
to shout about if we’re born of the Holy Spirit of God. To be deliv¬ 
ered from the power of sin and death is something to shout over. 
These old pioneer mothers, back forty or fifty years ago, were 
always shouting in church. In the revival meetings there were ^ome 
of the old mothers that could do things the preacher couldn’t do. 
When some of those old Christian mothers began to shout, it con¬ 
victed sinners. I think that shouting is just a gift of God and I think 
it’s a part of the service of God. I love to see the day when they 
glorify God. 
Do you have an altar in your church ? 
I believe in an altar. We’ve got one over here. When we built 
New Hope Church, we put that in the cornerstone over there, that 
the old-time altar be retained in that church as long as time lasts. 
I think an altar is for the Christian. You take those prophets back 
there, the first thing they did, and when Noah got out of the ark, 
the first thing he did was build an altar. And when Abraham started 
the journey, he built an altar. We have one and we come to that 
altar—the Christian people do every [Sunday] morning before the 
preaching starts. 
The altar’s not for sinners; it’s for Christians. The mercy seat is 
for sinners. It’s in the same place and sinners come there to the 
mercy seat. The Christians pray with them until they get right. 
Did you ever have any foot washings? 
Yes. We still have them over here [at New Hope] yet. When this 
church was established twenty-one years ago, it went to get in the 
[Baptist] Association. We had some modem preachers that objected 
to a foot-washing church being taken into the Association. We had 
a council [meeting] and I went in there with all the preachers of 
this county that was in the Tuckaseegee Association. I said, “These 
old pioneer preachers practiced foot washing and Jesus Christ prac¬ 
ticed it. If you’re telling me that I can’t be a Baptist and can’t follow 
the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ and do the things He did, I 
don’t want to be in the Association. We’ll go out before the Associa¬ 
tion and I’ll read the thirteenth chapter of John and if they’re not 
going to observe that and not going to let that be Bible, let’s just 
tear it out. We’ll put it before the whole Association and see what 
they think about it.” They agreed to [let us] have foot washings 
and be in the Association.

We put the ladies on one side of the church and the men on 
the other side. The men wash the men’s feet and the women wash 
the women’s feet. That’s about the best service you’ve ever been 
in. We have communion at the same time. We do it whenever there’s 
a fifth Sunday in the month. 
Do you believe in Divine healing? 
I don’t think anybody doesn’t believe in Divine healing. I think 
Jesus Christ has just as much power today as He had when He 
was here on earth. I don’t think that that’s ever been done away 
with. I believe that people are being healed today. 
I’ll tell you one experience I had and the reason why I believe 
in Divine healing. I was up at Cathan’s Chapel, the church where 
I first started preaching. I was at a revival meeting. We were having 
a good meeting there and I was the only preacher. In the evening 
I took sick—my bowels were running off and [I was] vomiting— 
just as sick as a man could be. Time began to run out before the 
service and there wasn’t anybody to preach. I went across the little 
creek there—I can go yet today to the very place I went to—and I 
said, “Lord, I believe You’re in this revival meeting. People’s being 
saved. I don’t have any medicine and if you want me to preach, 
heal me now.” The Lord healed me that minute. That’s been fifty- 
three years ago and that’s just as right to me today as it was then. 
I could go to that place today and show you the spot of earth where 
that happened. Now that happened to me and that’s been a great 
grace for me. Lots of times when doubts and things come, I could 
go back to that spot of earth where that took place. I believe in 
Divine healing. 
How could you recognize a Christian? 
You could tell them because of the way they talked and the way 
they lived. You could discern between the righteous people and 
the wicked people. They had the old-time altar in the home. They 
brought the children up to love and fear God. The seed has to be 
planted in the heart of the child. You can take a child and you 
can make anything out of him if you start in time. I believe that 
most of these criminals that come out—I think it’s neglect of the 
parents back there in the home. 
There’s never been a time as hard to live the Christian life as 
there is now. There’s so many things to get the attention of people 
and draw them away. Back in the olden days, back in my mother’s 
and father’s day, we didn’t have any newspapers. All we knew was

Jackson County and what was said. Where I lived up there, it took 
you a whole day to come to Sylva in an ox wagon. There was a 
tanner down there and in the summertime we’d peel tan bark and 
drag it off the mountain and load it on a wagon and bring it down 
here to Sylva and buy things we needed. In the fall of the year, 
we had hogs and things like that to kill and we’d bring them down 
here and get what we had to, salt and stuff we didn’t make on the 
farm. We just about had to eat what we made and make what we 
eat back then. You [can] hardly imagine how it was then—maybe 
come to Sylva once or twice a year. I heard my grandfather talk 
about going to Walhalla, South Carolina, and getting things that 
they had to have in wagons. Back in these mountains, they’d raise 
cattle, sheep, and hogs and they could take stuff like that down in 
there and swap it. 
How do you feel about church today ? 
A lot of church today is form. Back in the days of Jesus, those 
Pharisees had control of the Temple and Jesus didn’t have anything 
to do with the Temple. He couldn’t; He was bom in the manger 
and wrapped in swaddling cloth. That showed that pride could never 
enter into the Kingdom of God. Now you’ve got to get down to 
the manger if you’re ever [to be] bom into the Kingdom of God. 
That’s how Jesus came into the world. He said, “Pride is an abomina¬ 
tion in the sight of God.” I think that’s what’s wrong with the 
churches today. They’re not reaching the lost world. It’s been several 
years since I’ve seen an old man saved. Today you’ve also got to 
get young people to join the church. 
I think, however, that the church is the greatest institution on 
earth. To be a true Christian we have to put Christ first in our 
life. If it wasn’t for the church today, this world wouldn’t last an 
hour.

PLATE 4 Reverend Bly Owens. 
BLY OWENS, Southern Baptist 
We set off to find Reverend Bly Owens on a cold, snow-blustery day in 
early March. It seems like yesterday. Ben Cook and Joe Bishop had both 
mentioned Reverend Owens to us, and we knew we had to meet this man of 
whom they had spoken so kindly. After traveling what seemed like forever, 
mostly on a winding dirt road, Paul and I deduced more than once we were 
hopelessly lost. Time and time again, we pulled out our crude map and directions 
and, in anticipation, we kept saying, “just a little further. ” 
After traveling some twenty miles from the paved highway, we rounded a 
curve and came to the end of the road. We later learned we were in an area 
that is known as Wolf Mountain and there we found a small weather-worn 
frame house and the Reverend Bly Owens. Our time in travel was well spent. 
As we pulled into the driveway a tall, commanding man surrounded by a 
flock of grandchildren came out to greet us. He had been making ax handles 
from hickory wood, but was more than glad to talk to us about religion and 
his “blessed Savior. ” Throughout our interview this warm, kind-spoken man 
would become deeply touched, pause, muse, sometimes lighting his pipe, and 
transport us back through time as he related his life and evangelical experiences. 
After our first visit, we went to see Reverend Owens several more times. 
Once, Wendy and I found him shaking a swarm of bees into one of his many 
hives and expressing his utmost concern that neither she nor I get stung. On 
numerous occasions he would attend to the whims of his grandchildren and

communicate with them without directing his attention away from us. We 
always left Bly’s house believing that this profound man never knew what a 
stranger was, and as one of the oldest preachers in Jackson County, we are 
proud to have him as a part of our religious study. 
KEITH HEAD 
Man has tried everything he could to please the Lord but [man 
is] not doing what the Lord required of the human family. They’ve 
tried all kinds of old music and everything to worship the Lord 
and the Lord is displeased with it. We’ve gone down the last twenty 
years. If time were to last and we’d go twenty years longer it would 
be hard to pick up any spirit at any church. The Lord required 
this—and I’ve been a Bible reader about fifty years, I guess fifty- 
five years—the Lord required a living sacrifice. Not an old guitar 
or a dead audible, but a living sacrifice, whole and acceptable, which 
is your reasonable service. Well, that’s hard to get out of the people 
today—to give their bodies as living sacrifices. That’s what the Lord 
commanded the human race from the foundation—to give their bod¬ 
ies as living sacrifices. The Lord didn’t require something of me 
and you that we couldn’t do. 
The Lord has not left the people, the people have left the Lord 
to a great extent. Well, in my day—if you go back sixty-five or seventy 
years ago (I’ll soon be eighty-four years old)—there is just as much 
difference in the service of the Lord back then and now as there 
is in a sunshiny day and a dark night. Now that’s true. Well, they’ve 
got fashions and they’ve got forms. If you’ll show me—yonder lays 
two old King James Version X Bibles—if you’ll show me a proper 
word in there I’ll acknowledge to you. It’s all plain and common— 
recorded from Genesis to Revelations. 
The Lord said in the sixteenth chapter of Revelations that he 
would send hail upon the earth—every stone about the weight of 
a talent. Instead of repenting, they blasphemed the name of God 
and repented not to give Him glory; that’s God’s Word. Well, he 
poured out His vile upon the sun and the sun scorched men with 
heat and they repent not to give Him glory. Last summer we were 
down on Savannah between Dillsboro and Franklin [North Carolina]. 
Made two crops up there at the mouth of Betty’s Creek. There 
was some of the hottest sunshine, it was like fire heat. Just like 
building a big fire you know. Well, then He said—the Lord spoke 
of the last war. There will be wars and rumors of war and earthquakes 
and famine in different places. We’ve had wars, we’ve had earth-

quakes. America never has had a famine, but it looks like it’s liable 
to come. 
It looks like we’re living in the days of tribulation today. He said 
it would grow worse and worse until the end. Now that’s the Bible; 
that’s God’s Word. Then you’ll find it in all of these gospels. Now 
the first two thousand years from the creation God looked down 
and saw man’s heart [and it was] evil continually. There wasn’t but 
one righteous person and that was old Noah. He said, “Noah, know- 
eth thou thy grace in the eyes of God?” Noah walked with God. 
He said, “Noah, go build an ark. I’m going to destroy both man 
and beast whom I have created, off of the face of the earth.” It 
wasn’t anything his sons had done or wasn’t anything his daughter- 
in-law had done, wasn’t anything his wife had done. They were 
spared through Noah’s righteousness. Noah went and warned the 
people that the flood was coming. They made light of him. Lot of 
people made light of the gospel but when the waters began to climb 
to the highest peaks, they pushed the children up. They said, “Old 
Noah told the truth.” It stood many feet above the highest peak. 
Well, at the end of the next two thousand years, God saw that 
He had to have a sacrifice whereby man could be saved. A person 
wouldn’t go to heaven, they couldn’t be raised from the dead. The 
grave held the body. When He found the sacrifice, it was His only 
begotten son. It was the third part of the Godhead which was in 
the Trinity. They crucified Him and He rose and went back and 
sent the Holy Ghost. He said to His disciples, “It is good that I 
go away. If I go not away the Comforter will not come which will 
teach you the ways of all truth and all righteousness and bring all 
things unto your remembrance, whatsoever I have told you.” 
And now we are coming upon the last two thousand years. [There 
will be] fires and vapors before the great and terrible day of the 
Lord; that you’ll find in Malachi. That’s the last book of the old 
Bible. An airplane going over—a smoker you know. You’ve seen 
them going over and leaving a very long string of smoke. [The 
first time I saw one] I thought it was burning up and I came to 
the house and got my Bible and ran a reference on smoke. I found 
[that we would] have a sign in the sun and in the moon—there 
would be fire and vapors of smoke before the great and terrible 
day of the Lord. That’s the Bible; that’s the Lord’s Word. We are * 
getting right down and we are liable to see that any time. Our Bible’s 
about fulfilled. 
I was walking the railroad when the Lord saved me. I could go 
[there] today. I was walking the railroad when Christ came down 
on the cross right in the prettiest light in front of me. It was a

mile to the church. The first thing I knew I was in the churchyard. 
I can go back to that just as plain as it was when it happened. I’ve 
witnessed a lot right down through life. I’ve witnessed leadership 
of the Spirit down through life. 
Now listen fellows, I’m a Quaker in a way. I believe in waitin’ 
’til the Spirit moves. That was a Quaker. He believed in moving 
when the Spirit moves. I certainly believe that. I’ve run a revival 
in this room and baptized three grown people and they’re living 
today. I don’t believe in over-persuading people. I believe in giving 
them their choice. So there isn’t but one thing under the sun that’ll 
ever cause a wicked person to repent; that is the Word preached 
in power and purity. Go to that heart and you won’t get away from 
it. I was a mean boy back yonder, twenty-eight years old when I 
got right. I was twenty-eight the fourth day of June and joined the 
church and was baptized in the first days of October. If I live ’til 
the fourth of this next June I’ll be eighty-four. I’ve been down the 
road a long time. There were things in the beginning years that 
the devil would throw in my way. I can smile at Satan’s rage today 
and move on. It won’t hinder me, no sir. 
Why did you decide to become a preacher ? 
Lord have mercy; I didn’t decide nothing. I’d rather had my head 
cut off than to turn out to preach. But one night on that bed right 
there, I felt my calling. Well, I had blood poison shoot up from 
my wisdom tooth and run down here and it got to my collar bone. 
My brother-in-law went after old big Doc Nichols. He came to me 
and said, “Bly, if it would have been thirty minutes later, there 
wouldn’t have been a doctor in the world that could have saved 
you.” But before he got there, it was just as plain to me as—well, 
it was a calling. God had laid His hand on me and said, “Bly, go 
into the world and warn people of the great wrath of God.” 
I said, “Lord, I’ll take your Word and I’ll go and stand by as 
long as life lasts by your help.” 
I can’t get away from that today and if I would have said, “No, 
Lord, I can’t go,” in two or three days I’d’ve been under the ground. 
And that’s been years ago. Well, in three hours I was better and I 
was up in a few days. 
The first message that the Lord gave me you’ll find in Isaiah. 
Isaiah said, “Lord, send me.” That was up in the field up yonder. 
I could show you in full where I went to pray. The Lord just opened 
that up to me. I went to Charley’s Creek Church—the first message 
I ever preached in my life. God called me.

Do you remember any strong revivals ? 
When they’d run a meetin’ somewhere, [it would run] ten days 
and [they’d] baptize forty-five and fifty grown people. I’ve seen ’em 
fall just like setting one of those ax handles up there and turning 
it over. [It would just] lay and lay. But I guess if it was to happen 
in the church today, half of the people who claim to be Christian 
people would run out of the house scared. I’ve seen that in my 
day. 
Old Preacher Jordan ran a revival meeting over here in the edge 
of Transylvania [County, North Carolina] at what’s called Macedo¬ 
nia. He wanted to have success. A big Spanish Oak stood right 
close at the end of the church and a thunder rain came up. Lightning 
struck that Spanish Oak tree and tore it all to pieces. The old 
preacher fell on his knees and asked the Lord to strike the people 
with the Spirit as lightning struck that tree. And they fell at the 
spring [near the church], they fell in the yard, and they fell in the 
church. One woman lay forty-eight hours before she came through. 
My brother went and seen them baptized. I’ve been there lots of 
times at Macedonia—a spirited church. It’s way over a hundred and 
fifty years old. 
I’ve been over many a person a praying when they hollered and 
screamed that the Lord had saved them. Numbers and numbers 
of them. Got a neighbor that lives on the hill right over there. He 
put his arms right around my neck, down like that and I raised 
him up. Him and his boy. Yes sir. A couch sat over there where 
that record player is. He was just tore all to pieces and praying 
and evidence had come to me that the Lord had saved him. I said, 
“Marvin, pray on and see where you are. Evidence has come that 
the Lord has saved you.” He just finally calmed down and after a 
while, he got up. Well, I was having night meetings here—run about 
a week here and my wife’s baby sister was here and my boy’s wife. 
He came by the next evening and wanted to know where I was at. 
I was off and gone. He said, “Bly just told me last night when the 
Lord saved me.” Says, “I want to tell him I want to come back 
tonight and join the church for baptism.” 
Would you tell us about some of the baptizings with which you were involved? 
[A man] that lives up the road here had a girl grown and a grown 
boy. They got right. I baptized them in Wolf Creek Lake down 
here. I baptized three crowds in that lake. I moved up here on 
Tennessee Creek after that. I said I wasn’t gonna baptize no more

after that in that lake. That old mud. That mud was so deep—old 
stick mud would pull the socks off your feet! Yeah, I like to fell 
myself in there. I couldn’t pull my feet up! 
I went into a home over here and preached to those people. There 
were three in the family and not one of them belonged to the church. 
The woman was turned into eighty years old and the man into sev¬ 
enty-nine. My last message there, they all got right. I baptized five 
down there beyond that first bridge. Well, that summer I baptized 
sixteen in that holy water. Well, that man and that woman is laying 
on the hill up yonder. I don’t know how many people are laying 
on that hill that I baptized. 
We’ve got wise people in the world. We’ve got presidents and 
we’ve got the Senate and the Congress. There’s never been a person 
yet that could figure out—that little girl that was here a minute 
ago—there’s never been a person yet that could figure out the worth 
of that little soul. The Lord said the price of the soul of man was 
above rubies or the cattle of ten thousand hills. We get out here 
then, and maybe one soul gets saved and we say, “Well, we didn’t 
do much good.” But if you could gain the cattle of ten thousand 
hills in one hour, you’d think you were going to be a millionaire. 
But the price of the soul of man is above all that. That’s the Bible. 
That’s the Lord’s Word.

JOE BISHOP, Southern Baptist 
Reverend Joe Bishop and his wife, Pearl, live in a comfortable little house 
in a small clearing near a peaceful rolling creek in the sparsely populated 
community of Punkintown. Bom in August i8gy, one of eleven children in 
a farming family, Reverend Bishop is one of the oldest Baptist preachers we 
have interviewed. He has known and held revivals with other Baptist ministers, 
including Ben Cook and Bly Owens. 
Joe Bishop has served in the Baptist ministry for many years and has pastored 
in eight churches. Another of the old circuit-riding preachers, Reverend Bishop 
has dedicated his life to his family, community, and the growth of different 
churches and the teachings of Christ. Due to the overwhelming support of 
his congregation, he still pastors a church in the Punkintown community where 
he has lived for the past thirty-five years. 
KEITH HEAD 
I was just a big sinner, drunkard, gambler—everything wicked. 
And after coming out of World War I I got under conviction going 
to preaching. Brother Haggard [A. A. Haggard] from Tennessee 
ran a tent revival in Gastonia and I was saved there. I went to the 
altar—I’d been praying before I went to the altar. I didn’t stay at 
the altar very long until I was saved. Then the change came. I walked 
down the streets, the lights shined brighter, I was in a new world.

Paul said, “Behold, old things are passed away and all things have 
become new.” I was living in a new world around me. Wasn’t any 
trouble then for me to quit drinking and bootlegging or gambling 
or anything. It was gone. I never went back to it for fifty-six years 
now. 
I knew it down in my heart [that I was called to preach]. Fact of 
the matter, I knew from the time I was a little boy that I’d preach 
sometime. Yes, I’d preach, have a baptizing, and baptize dogs! [It 
was] just a natural gift to me. Preachers are not trained into being 
ministers, although we need all the schooling we can get. God told 
the old prophet, “I called you in your mother’s womb.” There’re 
bom preachers with a gift, a talent. Then you go ahead and accept 
Christ and develop that talent. Begin to preach. A man’s got a natural 
talent just like singing or anything else. Preaching is not a joke; 
it’s real. 
I walked these mountains, preach right on through the rain and 
snow. Never backed up for anything. We didn’t get much pay; the 
people didn’t have much. Back during the Depression, they could 
hardly pay a preacher. A lot of them quit, but I kept on going. I 
walked to Liberty Church over in Macon County, pastored there 
ten years and walked through these mountains. I walked to Mountain 
Grove Church, Ellijay Church. 
I’ve had lots of revivals. That church at Rainbow Springs that 
Ben Cook told you about—we had a big revival out there. I had a 
revival over at Cowee Church in Macon County; it went on five 
weeks I believe. Old Brother Clay was pastor [of that church]. That 
was the first time I ever preached a revival in this area. I was going 
to school down at Sylva. I’ve had good revivals here at my church. 
[One time] we lined the converts up along the gravel road down 
there to give them the right hand of church fellowship; I always 
gave the converts a handshake [after they were baptized]. 
I baptized a fellow out here when the pond was frozen. I wasn’t 
the pastor; Brother Hooper was, but he was late getting here and 
they sent out here [for me] and said that a fellow wanted me to 
baptize him. Somebody came out here and told me. I went out 
there and I said according to our belief—the church charter—you 
got to have seven members. They ran up there and got Mrs. Hyatt 
and a bunch of women and some of the men—picked some up. 
They didn’t have the pond fixed, had to dam it up some. There 
was an old boy standing there and he helped me baptize the fellow. 
About the time we got through, the pastor and all them came. There 
was ice all around the edge of [the pond].

I baptized, I believe, forty-one on what they called a cold Saturday. 
I walked about a quarter to half a mile down the road in my sock 
feet after I came out of there; it was down around zero. I baptized 
over here at Mountain Grove, on the pond there at old man Adams’ 
mills. It froze and the water poured over there and there were icicles 
hanging down there as big as your leg. I’d baptize at twenty below 
just as quick—no difference to me. He called me to do the job; 
I’ll do the job and leave the rest up to Him. There’s been lots of 
people baptized in cold weather and ice broken out. Of course now, 
in general, people hold their revival meetings in the summertime. 
But I never did go for that too much; I believe just anytime God 
leads men to get the people together, let them preach. 
Do you believe in shouting? 
People shout at the Baptist Church. They had a lot of shouting 
up here, used to; not as much as they used to. You shout when 
the Spirit moves you! Jesus was going into Jerusalem riding on a 
donkey. The disciples were with Him and they spread their garments 
down on the way; they were shouting praise to God. The Pharisees 
went up to Him and said, “speak to your disciples that they make 
their noise”—in other words, emotion. And He said if they didn’t 
cry, these very stones would cry. So that meant something was going 
on. If a fellow doesn’t believe in shouting, he better stay out of 
heaven! There will be lots of it up there. 
Have you ever seen any Divine healing? 
Yes, I’ve had several [experiences with Divine healing]. Well, right 
down here—you go down and ask the Chairman of the Board of 
Deacons or any of these fellows here—there was a girl down there 
and the doctor gave her up; they said she couldn’t live and they 
called me up from the road—I was going down to the store. I knelt 
there [with her] and prayed; I got up and said, “That girl will get 
well.” Later, a man came up to my house and I said, “What in 
the world has happened?” 
He said, “A miracle’s happened. That girl is just perfectly well 
now.” She’s living in Shelby now—raised a big family. 
I prayed with a woman over here at Wautauga; she had locked 
bowels—no doctor up there. I just had took Wautauga [begun to 
preach there] and I was walking down through there and her little 
girl called me. I didn’t know the people. I was practically a stranger 
myself over there. I went in there and had prayer with her. I prayed 
for God to let her live. I went down there and got old Brother

Corder and we took her to the hospital. They operated on her and 
the doctor told her husband, “She’s going to have a hard time to 
live. Gangrene’s set in.” 
She hollered out there and told them, “I’ll live.” As quick as 
she got through a prayer, I knew. Yes, I believe in Divine healing. 
She got well and raised two kids. 
I had two operations in the last month and a half. I came out 
of the hospital and came on home. I’ve had lots [of Divine healing]. 
I believe in that. But I don’t believe in foolishness now. Yes sir, 
with the help of doctors, I believe in getting down there with God 
and praying your way through. 
How do you feel about snake handling? 
I think it’s just pure foolishness because of the power in a poison¬ 
ous snake. It’ll kill you if you don’t get something done about it. 
God never puts you in a position where He would impose on you 
affliction of that kind. It’s going against the law of nature, the natural 
things. If I cut my finger off, it’s going to hurt and it’s going to 
bleed. And if you get in there and let a snake bite you—I know 
one fellow was talking about it and I said, “If God tells me to handle 
a snake, I ain’t going to do it.” 
When you sum up salvation of religion and God’s plan, it takes 
good, common bay horse sense all the way through. Religion is 
so strange; everybody’s got religion. They’ve got some kind of reli¬ 
gion, something they bow to—they pray to the moon or the cows 
or something. Salvation in the New Testament is just good, common 
bay horse sense. That’s all you can make out of it—God saves a 
man by faith m-the Lord Jesus Christ. We don’t always do that, of 
course. 
How do you feel about stringed music in the church? 
Some of the old people didn’t believe in that. I put it this way 
to one old lady: “The Lord made all the music because it’s good 
and the Devil stole part of it!” I was at a revival and a bunch of 
fellows came in a quartet and they had a guitar with their music. 
There was an old woman there and she was kind of boss there; 
she built the church there with her own money—a fine building. 
They never would contrary her because she was a good woman; a 
good Christian. She said, “You can’t bring that in here. You’ll have 
to leave that out.” Well, that left out their singing; they came to 
sing. 
I said, “Why?” 

============================================================
PAGE 54

She said, “I don’t believe in string music.” 
I said, “Move the piano then. Get it out of here.” 
She said, “What?” 
I said, “Yes m’am, the piano’s string music.” 
She said, “Well, I love you, Joe. I’ll take your word for it. Come 
on in.” 
And that settled the question. She’d always ruled that out, see. 
I had a tuning fork. Hit that thing on the wall somewhere and 
take off with it! But young singers growing up now can’t do that. 
They don’t know enough about music. 
How do you feel about speaking in tongues ? 
Well, I think that tongue’s a language. It’s mentioned there in 
Acts. I think if God had given it to anybody, He’d given it to me 
as much as I’ve prayed and worked. I’m not going to argue with 
them about their belief in that. Evidently God gave it to those people 
there at Pentecost. They were there from every nation under heaven 
and they heard them speak in their own tongue. God gave it to 
them there. It’s possible He could give it to a person today. 
Have you ever had any visions ? 
All the time; God said where there’s no vision, the people perish. 
The church and each member of it needs a vision. Each Christian 
needs to have a vision; a vision of the lost world. I had a vision 
or a dream one night in the hospital; all the next day it seemed 
like I was in another world. I saw the Judgment. Everything had 
kind of an orange color. All kinds of people were there. I saw my 
family there; others were trying to hide. It was a vision, I think, of 
the Final Judgment. 
What has been your greatest joy as a minister ? 
Winning souls. Seeing people saved. Going to them personally, 
talking with them, praying with them; then watching them live it. 
I don’t worry about the money. I’d stayed in the gambling business, 
the bootlegging business or something if I wanted money. I’m over 
eighty years old [now], and I’d walk one hundred miles if I knew 
I could win one soul. Yes, that’s what I prayed for when I’d get 
sick a lot of times—God let me get well and win one more soul.

HOWARD SOUTHARDS, 
Independent Baptist 
/ have attended many church services down through the years and there 
are certain sermons that I have heard [that have] remained in my memory 
as being more powerful and dynamic than others. These include Reverend 
Clendennon’s “Open Your Windows Eastward, ” Hal Lindsey’s, “The 1980s— 
Countdown to Armegeddon, ” and another I heard several years ago at the 
Kettle Rock Baptist Church preached by Reverend Howard Southards and 
entitled “God’s Fence Around Hell. ” In this message, the Independent Baptist 
minister spoke of the love of God and His many efforts to attempt to save 
all men. 
To me, this one message typifies the sermons of Reverend Southards, which 
constantly stress God’s love for and patience toward His people and the opportu¬ 
nities He gives sinners to repent. Although Reverend Southards is a pastor 
and leader, he sees his role as being a servant to his God and his congregation. 
He offers help and encouragement to those both in and out of his church 
and strives to live the Christian example. He refuses to compromise or give 
in on issues he sees as important to the development of Christianity and the 
church in today’s world. Simply, it seems that Reverend Howard Southards 
is a part of that “fence around hell. ”

I’ve always enjoyed sharing my experience with the Lord with 
other people. Approximately thirty-three years ago this month, I 
felt the call of God to be saved. I was fourteen years old. I had 
gone to church all of my life; my daddy and mother were Christians, 
they had raised me in church. I’d gone to Sunday school and church 
all of my life but not until that Saturday afternoon did I really feel 
the call of God to be saved. We used to have services on the first 
Saturday and Sunday in the month; that’s the only time the preacher 
came around. He pastored three or four churches and he’d only 
come to our church once a month. So that Saturday afternoon—I 
remember the verse of scripture he preached from in St. Luke, chap¬ 
ter three, verse nine: “Now therefore the ax is laid to the root of 
the tree and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn 
down and cast into the fire.” And I could almost feel the flames 
of hell engulfing me. When that preacher got through preaching, 
he gave the invitation to be saved. We had what we called a mourn¬ 
er’s bench in the church. Praise God! I made my way down to that 
mourner’s bench. I didn’t shake a preacher’s hand to get saved. I 
didn’t sign any card to get saved, but I fell on my knees there at 
that mourner’s bench. A boy of fourteen years old. I’d never tasted 
a drop of whiskey, I’d never taken God’s name in vain, I’d never 
said a curse word, but I realized that I was a sinner going to hell. 
On that mourner’s bench about three o’clock in the afternoon— 
I can remember just as well as if it were today—I cried out, “God, 
be merciful to me, a sinner. Don’t let me go to hell. Save me!” I 
can’t tell you what happened; I honestly don’t know. All I know is 
something happened to me. I can’t explain my physical birth, but 
I know I was physically bom. I can’t explain my spiritual birth, but 
I know that I was spiritually bom that day. That Saturday afternoon 
about three o’clock, I was born into the family of God. And that 
same Saturday, God wrote my name in the Book of Life just as 
sure as this world. By my faith, I’ve seen my name in the Book of 
Life. Now maybe other people haven’t had that experience, but I’ve 
seen my name there and I know that I’m saved. There’s a lot of 
things I don’t know but one fact I know for sure—beyond a shadow 
of a doubt—there’s not enough devils in hell to make me believe 
that I’m not saved. I know I am! Beyond anything else in this world, 
I know that I’m saved because that Saturday afternoon something 
different happened to me. I was saved; bom again of the Spirit of 
God. And I praise God for it. Amen! 
[When I was called to preach,] I felt that the Lord was dealing 
with me in a special way—not that I felt I was a better Christian

than anyone else; I didn’t feel that I was closer to the Lord than 
anyone else. But I will tell you this: Before my calling happened, 
I had gone back to the altar and asked God to baptize me with 
the Holy Ghost. Now this is another thing that [some] Baptist folks 
will laugh at you about, but it is definitely taught in the Word of 
the God. I had gone back to the altar and asked God to baptize 
me with the Holy Spirit so that I could be a witness for Him. I 
was ashamed to mention the name of Jesus to people and if I felt 
somebody was lost and needed witnessing to, I’d back away; I 
couldn’t do it. I just didn’t have the power of God in my life. Well, 
I got the feeling of the Holy Spirit of God. And then I felt like 
the Lord wanted me to preach His Word. Like any human being, 
I began to back away because I felt I was incapable of doing it; I 
just couldn’t do it. But the Holy Spirit kept dealing with me and I 
kept saying, “God, there are other people that have more education 
than I have.” 
But God kept saying, “Son, I’m counting on you. I want you to 
99 
go. 
I kept saying, “Lord, I can’t leave my family. I just can’t do it. I 
just can’t do it. I just can’t accept the responsibility. I’m just not 
capable. I wasn’t born to do that.” 
But God kept saying, “Son, I want you to preach.” 
For three and a half years I carried that burden of this thing, 
knowing that I should be preaching but trying to get out of it. But 
all the time I knew that sooner or later I was going to have to 
preach because there is a calling for which there is no repentance. 
God knows what He’s doing; He doesn’t make a mistake. And for 
three years, I ran from this. I tried to get out of it. 
I went to prayer meeting one Wednesday night and during that 
prayer service at our church, I was under such a burden that I can’t 
even remember who the man was that preached—I can’t even re¬ 
member what he preached about. All I knew was that if I didn’t 
get that burden off my heart, I was going to die. I almost had a 
nervous breakdown. I was working at the [Atlanta General Motors] 
plant [then]. So I came home from that prayer meeting—I’d 
gone by myself because my wife had stayed home with one of the 
kids who was sick—and I told my wife I was going to have to 
preach. 
She said, “Well, if the Lord’s calling you, you better preach.” 
I went to bed and I was just hoo-hooing; I was crying and I got 
out of the bed and got down on my knees and I prayed and asked 
God to take the burden. I said, “Lord, I’ll preach if you want me

to.” But somehow the burden was still there. I got back up and 
got into bed and went to sleep. I got up the next morning and 
went to work and along about nine o’clock that burden hit me so 
heavy, I thought I was going to die. And I just burst out crying 
up there in the plant where I worked among all those men. 
This fellow [there] thought he’d done something to me and he 
asked me, “What’s the matter?” 
I said, “Well, I’m going to have to preach. God’s calling me to 
preach.” 
He said, “Well, I knew you were going to have to. You’re too 
good a fellow for the Lord not to use you in a special way.” 
I came back home that night. I got down on my knees and I 
said, “Lord, I know I can’t do much and I know there’s others 
that could do a better job, but if you want me to go, here I am. 
I’m willing to do the best I can.” And that burden left me. I’m 
not the greatest preacher. I’m one of the sorriest that God’s got, 
but He has used me. And I praise God for that. Ever since that 
day, ever since that burden lifted, I’ve tried to preach what God 
lay on my heart. The first message I preached was in John fourteen 
and six: Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.” I 
never changed my message since then. He’s still “the Way, the Truth, 
and the Life.” I haven’t another gospel to preach but Jesus. God 
has blessed me and God has used me. I know that I’m the least of 
God’s preachers, but I praise God that He called me. Thank God, 
that He did. There’s a great responsibility and there’s a great burden. 
But there’s a great blessing, too, in being a preacher of the gospel. 
[I am with] the Independent Baptist Church and [it] is not affiliated 
with the Southern Baptist Convention at all. We’re independent 
of the Southern Baptists and our fellowship headquarters are in 
Springfield, Missouri. There’s over sixteen hundred churches in our 
independent fellowship, but every church in our fellowship is autono¬ 
mous and each rules and regulates their own business. In other 
words, nobody tells us what to do, not even our fellowship headquar¬ 
ters. They don’t dictate anything to us. We’re autonomous in that 
we control our own business. We rule our own house, in other 
words. 
We split from the Southern Baptists and the original split came 
somewhere along about 1950 when the Revised Standard Version 
of the Bible came out. The Revised Standard Version of the Bible 
came out [and this Bible] rearranged the scriptures where it doesn’t 
even read like our King James Version. And we Independents will 
not accept any version of the Bible other than the King James Ver-

sion. We stand upon the King James Version. We don’t want any 
revised versions. We don’t accept any of those. That was the main 
thing it [the split] came over. 
The Revised Standard Version leaves things out that are important 
in the scripture. In the King James, for instance, in John, chapter 
fourteen—a familiar scripture—it says, “In my father’s house there 
are many mansions,” and in the Revised Standard, it says, “In my 
father’s house are many rooms,” and there is a vast difference. There 
is a difference between a room and a mansion—a vast difference. 
Then it [the Revised Standard Version] also denies the virgin birth; 
it says that Jesus was bom of a young woman. And I’m not saying 
that she wasn’t a young woman when Jesus was bom. But there’s 
a difference between a young woman and a virgin. The King James 
Version definitely declares that Jesus was bom of a virgin. Had He 
not been, we wouldn’t of had any gospel to preach. But He was 
virgin-bom and they left that out. Therefore, these old-timers 
couldn’t accept that and I don’t either. I refuse to accept that Jesus 
was bom of a young woman. He was definitely born of a virgin, 
because the Bible specifically says that He was. 
That was the main issue on why the Independents split out from 
the Southern Baptists. There are several other [issues] that the Inde¬ 
pendents and Southern Baptists don’t agree on. This cooperative 
program that the Southern Baptists have—[from that] they send 
part of their money to their theological seminaries [one of which 
is] up in Louisville, Kentucky. And in this seminary, they have infidels 
teaching. I cannot honestly send my money knowing good and well 
that young men are going up there [to learn] to preach and that 
these infidels are teaching them that the book of Genesis is a myth— 
that you can’t believe the creation, and that in the book of Jonah, 
the miracle that happened to Jonah didn’t really happen. These 
infidels are teaching these young preachers all of this and then they 
come back to these little churches like here in Macon County and 
they’ll tell you there’s errors in the Bible and that it’s not the infallible 
Word of God and then they tear the churches all to pieces. I cannot 
support them by paying salaries [to those] up there that are teaching 
in those schools. I’ve got to answer to God for where I give my 
money and I’m not going to support such as that. 
We send our money directly to our own missionaries. One of 
the missionaries that we support was over at the church the other 
day. He came back from Africa. We &end money [from our church] 
directly to him. Not necessarily on a [regular] schedule—sometimes 
once a month or once every three months, or just whenever we 

============================================================

feel like it. We send it directly to our missionary and he, in return, 
sends me a receipt that he received every penny of that money. I 
take that receipt and read it to my church in a business meeting. 
No one else gets their hands on that money but him. Every penny 
of it goes directly to the missionary. The Southern Baptists send 
part of their money to this cooperative program and with that money 
[they pay their missionaries] and then they have to pay all their 
people to operate that program. 
I can’t agree with [the Southern Baptists] on these things. That’s 
why we’re independent. We’re completely disassembled from them. 
We’re not affiliated with them at all. 
In most Independent Baptist churches like my own, we definitely 
believe in shouting. As a matter of fact, we have shouting on Wednes¬ 
day night over at our church. People shout on Wednesday night, 
just like they do on Sunday [morning] and Sunday night. But one 
[person] sent me word the other day that I was living on emotional¬ 
ism. And I told him, “No, I wasn’t living on emotionalism, I was 
living with it!” We believe in emotion—definitely believe in emotion. 
If the Holy Spirit doesn’t touch a person until they can praise God 
once in a while, they’re not close enough to God! They need to 
get a little closer! And we definitely believe in shouting; just as 
well get use to it, because we’re going to shout when we get to 
heaven! So now’s a good time to get tuned in! I’ll tell you what 
we have done. We’ve formed a prayer chain over at our church. 
Everybody’d hold hands and just complete the circle of the church. 
And people get to praying and then get to shouting. 
Basically the Independent Baptist Church believes in the old-time 
way; in other words, what the old-time Baptists use to be. As the 
song says, “We believe in the old-time preaching, praying, singing, 
and shouting.” The modern Baptists have excluded all of that. And 
they have a little sermonette and little form of Godliness. [They’ve] 
left the Spirit of God out. Most of the Southern Baptist churches 
you go to and in some of the Independent, they’ll hand you a little 
bulletin back at the door and they already have the program fixed 
out. They know a month in advance what’s going to take place. 
But we don’t do that; we just believe in letting the Holy Spirit of 
God lead us. Now we have a certain time to meet over there but 
what’s going to take place after we get there, we have no idea. 
[We] just let the Holy Spirit lead us. [We] just worship God in 
spirit and in truth. 
I know a lot of people believe in Divine healing. We Independent 
Baptists do, too. We believe in anointing people with oil. I have

a bottle in my pulpit. I anoint people with oil and pray for them 
because it’s in the Bible. But do you know some people look down 
their noses at me and say that I’m a fanatic? They say that I’ve 
flipped my lid . . . that I’m crazy, that I’m old-fashioned, I’m a 
fogy because I believe that. But I’ve seen people healed by the 
power of God because we obey what God’s Word says to do. God 
heals because we do what He says do. 
We had a lady that asked us to pray for her. [She] had cancer. 
She had been to the doctor over here in Sylva [North Carolina], 
and the doctor told her that she definitely had cancer. Another 
preacher, another man, and myself anointed her with oil and prayed 
for her on a Saturday night and God instantly healed her. She went 
back to the doctor on Tuesday; they x-rayed her and examined her 
and that doctor came out of that office shaking his head and said, 
“When you were over here the other day, you were eaten up with 
cancer. Now I can’t find anything wrong with you but a little ulcer 
in your stomach.’’ God instantly healed her. 
I’m going to give you my own personal experience. I had a kidney 
stone. I spent five days in the hospital and they x-rayed me every 
day and knew just exactly where that thing was every day. The kidney 
stone moved from the top of my kidney down to the bottom of 
my kidney within those five days. I never passed the stone in those 
five days and my doctor told me that I could come home. He said, 
“Go home and get on the lawnmower; ride the lawnmower and 
mow the grass and this and that and maybe you’ll pass it.” This 
was on a Thursday. He told me to come back to his office on Monday 
to be x-rayed again. I came home, went to church on Sunday, and 
had my deacons anoint me. I had my oil over at the church and 
I had them anoint me and pray for me. And boys, just as sure as 
I’m sitting in this chair, God took that kidney stone out of me and 
I haven’t got a scar. I went back to the doctor’s office on Monday 
and was x-rayed. The doctor came down from operating at eleven 
o’clock and he looked at those x-rays and he said, “You take him 
back in there and x-ray him again.” 
Then he called me back into the office where he was developing 
the film and he said, “Well, it’s gone.” 
And I said, “Sure it is. I know it is.” 
He said, “We can’t find it on the x-ray.” 
And I said, “Sure it’s gone.” 
Just as sure as I’m sitting in this chair, God took that stone out 
of me. We obeyed what God’s Word said to do and they anointed 
me with oil and prayed for me. And if that verse of scripture isn’t

any good, then neither is John 3:16. But it’s all the infallible, inspired 
Word of God and we believe it just exactly as it is. Don’t try to 
leave it out or add to it or take from it—-just accept it like it is 
and believe it like it is and preach it like it is. 
I’ve [also] seen instances in my church. Now, I know someone 
would make fun of me if I tell them we anoint people when they 
have a sick headache. They’d make fun of me and say, “Well, a 
headache will go away anyhow.” But I believe in talking to God 
about everything—about a headache, a cold or anything else. God’s 
interested in the little things as well as the big things. So I’ve anointed 
people over there with a sick headache and immediately it would 
be gone! And I anointed a lady over there the other day that had 
the doctor tell her she had pleuresy. They had gone on vacation 
over in Gatlinburg [Tennessee], and had to come home; she got 
sick and had to come home. I anointed her and prayed for her 
and God immediately healed her. God does those things! He defi¬ 
nitely does those things. But some people will laugh at you. They’ll 
say “Ah, that’s for the Pentecostal people,” or “That’s for somebody 
else.” But praise God, it’s for me just the same as anyone else. 
That’s why some call me a fanatic and an old fogy and others call 
me trash. A fellow called me on the phone the other day because 
of what I’ve preached and he said I was going to hell and leading 
my whole church to hell. But I just stand for the Word of God. 
I’m just as sure saved as I’m sitting here in this chair. There is 
something about it that I know—I know! The devil can’t make me 
doubt it. Praise God!

PLATE 7 Howard Parham. 
HOWARD PARHAM, Primitive Baptist 
Low in number in this area, the Primitive Baptists draw criticism from 
many groups, including other branches of the Baptist faith, because of their 
belief in predestination. As Mr. Parham says, “We believe that God’s got it 
all planned and [everything’s\ already predestinated; we’re just here to carry 
out what He has predestinated for us to do. ” The Primitive Baptists do not 
believe in missionaries, Sunday school, or the use of musical instruments in 
the church. Even though the Primitive Baptists are criticized, Mr. Parham 
remains steadfast in his faith: “The old Primitive Baptists, I’m not ashamed 
of them at all. I know they’ve dwindled down to nothing, but I’m still convinced 
they’re more right than ever now. ’’ 
This interview is presented in two parts. The first contains Mr. Parham’s 
discussion of the Primitive Baptists and in the second he talks about the old 
Lystra Primitive Baptist Church which still stands today. The section about 
Lystra Church first appeared in Foxfire magazine, Fall, 1976. 
KEITH HEAD 
The two [religions] that came here to start with, I understand, 
was just the Catholic and the Primitive Baptist, and the rest of them 
just sprung off from them. I don’t know when they first landed at 
Plymouth Rock up yonder, but it was way back there around 1600

and something, and that’s been a long time ago. Of course, the 
Indians were already here and they had their belief. 
The Primitive Baptist wasn’t took up in this [part of the country] 
’til 1902. [Until then] there were just Baptists [here]. In 1902 this 
association right here took up the Primitive Baptist—they put the 
“Primitive” to it to make it original. The others call theirselves just 
Baptists. What we call Missionary Baptists, sprung off from the Primi¬ 
tive Baptist. They sprung off on foreign mission, and the regular 
Primitive Baptists don’t believe in foreign mission; we don’t believe 
we can carry the gospel anywhere because it’s all God’s work. We 
believe that God’s got it all [planned] and [everything’s] already 
predestinated; we’re just here to carry out what He has predestinated 
for us to do. We do have “called” preachers. He can call some in 
the foreign nations as good as He can here, because He said, “I 
have a people in all kindreds and tongues.” But He don’t predesti¬ 
nate us to work in foreign missions. Therefore, that’s what the big 
difference is right there. 
We don’t believe you can have anything to do with your salvation 
and the Missionary Baptists believe they do. [We believe] He speaks 
and it’s done, and He commands and it stands fact. If He tells one 
of His little ones to “come unto me,” then they’ll come; they can’t 
resist. You can’t resist the power of God. But the Missionary Baptists 
will tell you that you’ve got to do first, before God will do. ’Course, 
there’s several different kinds of Baptists: Missionary Baptists and 
Free Will and all that; and, of course, they’ve got the Churches of 
God. But [all those beliefs are based] on the same principle. They 
believe in the “good do” system—you've got to do before God can 
do—and we just don’t believe in it. We believe that all God’s children 
will do good [or bad] because it’s predestinated for them. That’s 
the biggest split right there. Regular Baptists don’t believe in predes¬ 
tination. [We believe everybody was predestined] before the world 
was even made. 
The Presbyterians believe in predestination to a certain extent. 
We’ve got some people now that call themselves Primitive Baptists 
who believe that God predestinated all good things, and the bad 
things are left to the people, but we don’t believe that way. We 
believe that God predestinated all things, good and bad. What we 
call “bad” is for God’s good to serve His purpose, and it brings 
out the good. All that we call evil brings out the good. 
He’s got an elect family. That’s another thing where [the Baptists] 
split. [Regular Baptists] don’t believe that God’s got just an elect 
family. They believe that just anybody [can be saved]. When He 

============================================================
PAGE 65
============================================================

BAPTISTS 
63 
said, “All come unto me,” He was talking about all that He had 
elected. He already had said that He had an elect family. So, there’s 
a lot of difference—-just as much as night and day—in regular Primi¬ 
tive Baptists and regular Baptists. 
There isn’t nobody that can live above sin. [God] just comes in 
momentarily and then He withdraws. You’ll sin. When God with¬ 
draws His Spirit from you, you’re in sin; you’re already a sinner. 
You don’t have to go out here and do anything, ’cause you’re a 
sinner then. If [people] could [live above sin], there wouldn’t have 
been any need for Christ to come. That was His purpose of coming 
on this earth. It was God’s will for Him to come here and live above 
sin. He’s the only one that’s ever done it. 
I couldn’t say that I’ve been born again. I have to go back to 
where I say I hope I have, and that’s as far as I can go. You’ve 
just got to hope, and you don’t know [whether you’re saved or 
not]. You see, in the eighth chapter of Romans, Paul was speaking 
to the Romans and he said, “You’re saved by hope.” And, if you 
see a thing, why should you hope for it? It was just like me coming 
home tonight: I was hoping I’d have a good supper, but when I 
got here and got the supper, then my hope ceased, because I’d 
come into possession. That’s the only way you’ll ever know about 
heaven . . . when you come into possession. 
When I [began going to the Primitive Baptist Church,] I went 
for years expecting to join there. That’s one thing that they don’t 
do; they don’t ask anybody to join the church—never. So, one August 
meeting (they used to have August meeting over there and commu¬ 
nion and foot washing), I went, but I decided I wouldn’t join that 
day, because a lot of [my people] would be there. I wanted to join 
when there wasn’t anybody there much, so if they turned me down, 
it wouldn’t be embarrassing to the old flesh. But I did. I had an 
experience that day when they called for the opening of the doors 
of the church. 
You have to get up and tell your experience—what the Lord’s 
done for you—when you join. The biggest thing I had to get up 
and tell about was how much I loved them all and how I loved 
the church, and that I didn’t feel fit to be with them, but I did 
want a home with them. I got up, I walked down that aisle, and it 
was just easy as everything—as the old saying goes, “as falling off 
a log.” I felt like I was just walking on air, and that was a great 
experience. I’d always had the experience where I wanted to hug 
every one of their necks, and I got to do it when I joined the church. 
Then, the next Sunday was the baptizing, and I had a great experi-

64 
ence there. When I walked into the water and was baptized, I felt 
like there was something that was washed away. No doubt at the 
time. But, I’ve doubted that a lot of times since. So, I live in doubt 
the biggest portion of my time. They are all that way, every Primitive 
Baptist that I know. A true Primitive Baptist doesn’t know if he’s 
saved. 
I had another experience. When I was coming from church one 
time, I was coming down this road up here, and I could see every¬ 
thing—every blade of grass and everything. I was just lifted up, 
worshipping God, and nothing could bother me. I didn’t need any¬ 
thing, ’cause I was taken out of this world. I believe that. But, I’ve 
often thought a lot of times since then, “What was that?’’ I believe 
I knew at the time; but, you see, that’s it, you don’t ever know. 
You’ll never get [the Primitive Baptists] to tell you that they know 
they’re saved or know they’re a child of God. They’ll say, “I hope 
I am.” 
We don’t believe in Sunday school because we don’t believe [just 
anybody] can teach God’s Word unless it’s God’s will. He did tell 
His disciples to go teach, and those that He told to go teach we 
believe are the preachers. As far as picking up the Bible and teaching 
it [in Sunday school], we just don’t believe in it. What we do believe 
in is the preacher getting up there and preaching. You take whenever 
a preacher gets up and preaches . . . if I haven’t experienced some¬ 
thing he’s talking about, it isn’t worth anything to me—not a thing 
in the world. But, when he gets to preaching his experiences and 
my experience, and both of these are alike, then there is where 
your teaching comes in. He will bring across some points that you 
haven’t thought of. The scripture says “teaching and preaching is 
to stir up your pure mind.” You’ve already got that pure mind in 
there; it’s just got to be stirred up, and that is one way God has 
got of doing it—through that man. The man had nothing to do 
with it because [the Bible] says, “Every good and perfect gift comes 
down from above.” 
We don’t have any music, no piano, no nothing. We just sing. 
When you’re blessed to sing and blessed to hear it, it’s prettier 
than anything else in the world. There isn’t any piano to drown it 
out, either. It’s really pretty. I think I’ve heard as good of singing 
right over there at Lystra [Primitive Baptist Church] as I’ve ever 
heard in my life, I’m telling you, with no piano. They’ve just never 
believed in it. We believe in piano and music in homes. I like good 
string music—all of them do, but that’s worldly stuff. When you 

============================================================
PAGE 67
============================================================

BAPTISTS 
65 
go to worship God, they just don’t believe in taking the worldly 
stuff and putting it in the church. All those old songs that we use 
were inspired by God just like the scriptures were. We believe that 
they aren’t anything but sermons themselves. We feel that if God 
blessed us to sing, we’ve got the music. We don’t need the piano 
there to drown out the music. 
We don’t have any special services as far as sunrise service, sere¬ 
nade, and all that. [We have church] once a month. That’s the way 
all Primitive Baptist churches are. Once a month—maybe a Saturday 
and a Sunday. It used to always be eleven on Saturday and eleven 
on Sunday, but I’ve noticed some of these churches now, on account 
of people working in public work, have it at two-thirty in the after¬ 
noon on Saturday. Over at Lystra, it went on at eleven on Saturday 
and Sunday. 
We don’t believe in any such a word as revival. There isn’t but 
one revival, and that’s Jesus Christ, Himself. The Baptists say they 
have a revival to revive the people up. We don’t believe that one 
person can revive another up; Jesus Christ does that alone. We 
do have “attracted” meetings we call it, and associations and things 
like that. That’s to get together, all the churches. But as far as a 
revival, we never refer to it as that. 
[At Lystra] we used to have associations and a union meeting. 
We’d have a union meeting in the spring, and then an association 
in the fall, and [each time] all the churches would meet together. 
We used to have our association the second weekend in October— 
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
Every time each church would have to make a report [as to 
whether] they were in peace [with one another]. If [the churches] 
weren’t in peace, the association wouldn’t recognize them. They’d 
have to get in peace among themselves. [For example,] sometimes 
the members would get out with each other or somebody might 
bring a charge against a member. They would deal with that until 
they got it settled and if he didn’t straighten up his ways, then he 
would have to be turned out [of the church]. Even out here in natural 
life, two brothers might trade around somewhere and fall out with 
each other. If they did, they’d have to straighten that out and get 
back in fellowship with each other or whichever one that’s in fault 
would be turned out—whichever one they determine is in fault' 
or both. They’d sure turn them out. The preacher hasn’t got any 
say-so at all in the Primitive Baptist church, it’s the deacons that 
rule the church. But whenever they turn anybody out of the church, 

============================================================
PAGE 68
============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
somebody’s got to make a motion. Then they appoint a committee 
to go out and see what the trouble is and see if they can’t correct 
it. If they can’t, then they go ahead and turn them out. 
[At association] they have their business part, then they’d go into 
the preaching. They’d have visiting preachers. I’ve been up to North 
Carolina a good many times on three-day meetings and heard twenty- 
seven preachers. I’m hoping to hear ten or fifteen this weekend. 
They start preaching around nine or ten o’clock, and go on ’til 
about two or three, something like that, and maybe have a lunch 
on the ground. 
We communed quarterly [every three months], then we washed 
feet once a year. [We had a communion table] for the deacons to 
sit at to serve the wine and the bread. Just as soon as we’d get 
through communion in August, we always go through the foot wash¬ 
ing after the preaching. We’d turn two benches together and spread 
towels over it for them to wash each others’ feet. The women would 
wash each others’ feet and the men would wash each others’ feet. 
That’s the purpose of the women [sitting on one side of the aisle] 
and the men on [the other]. That’s the way they always were. 
Churches are still set up that way. There’s a church right up here 
above Athens [Georgia] called Mt. Zion, and I go there every second 
Sunday. The men sit on [one] side and the women on [the other]. 
It’s just a custom. It’s not anything the regular Primitive Baptists 
have got against women, ’cause they generally think well of the 
women folks. 
[According to John,] when the supper was ended, Christ girded 
Himself with a towel and began to wash His disciples’ feet. He 
washed all His disciples’ feet. Then He said, “You call me Lord 
and Master, so am I. Ye should wash each others’ feet hereafter.” 
[Washing feet] shows humbleness. Now I’ll tell you, when I first 
joined the Primitive Baptist church, I was a fairly young man, and 
to let one of them old gray-haired men get down and wash my 
feet ... if that didn’t make you feel little! 
I’m telling you, it sure takes something out of you, but it’s a 
great communion to wash each others’ feet. You know, there’s a 
Missionary Baptist church below Comer that pulled out and split 
from our church. They washed feet there for years and years until 
one of the women stole the other women’s hose and that broke 
up the foot washing. That’s what they tell me. Now, I don’t know, 
I wasn’t there. 
There’s been some changes [in the church]. It isn’t like it was 

============================================================
PAGE 69
============================================================

BAPTISTS 
67 
when I first joined. Paul set the church up to Timothy and them 
back yonder in Corinthians. When he was setting up the church, 
he told them that the woman was to be silent in the church, and 
not to speak ’til they got back home. [That] if they had anything 
to bring to the church, to tell their husband. That’s the way it always 
was, but I’ve noticed now that women are taking more part in the 
church. So, it isn’t exactly like it was. It’s changed some. 
We don’t have offerings. When the meeting’s over, if anybody 
wants to give the preacher [some money, they can]. We just give 
him something for his expenses. We’d try to pay him his way to 
here and back. As far as the offerings, there’s never been an offering 
taken. There’s never been a plate passed around in a Primitive Bap¬ 
tist church that I ever knew of—not a true Primitive Baptist church. 
[Primitive Baptists dress up for church] now, but I remember a 
time that they’d come to Lystra in their overalls and brogan shoes. 
Of course, that’s about all they had way back in the thirties, and 
they didn’t think anything about it. Since I’ve been a member (I 
joined over there in ’51) I’ve known them to come in overalls. 
They’re not against [going to ballgames and movies] or going 
to a dance or anything because that’s worldly stuff. [It’s acceptable] 
as long as you conduct yourself right. We’ve got it on the church 
record where they turned some out for not paying their debts, or 
being drunk or disorderly. Turn them out of the church. The biggest 
portion of Primitive Baptists believe in taking a drink. I’ve always 
had my preacher a drink when he comes, but that’s as far as they 
want to go. If a man can’t control it, that’s it. 
God can [heal people]. That’s all the healing there is. You take 
these doctors and all. What skill they’ve got comes from God; it’s 
just a blessing from God that they’ve got, and they can’t heal any¬ 
body. It’s a blessing that God gives. I’ve seen Oral Roberts do it 
on TV, but as [far as I’m concerned] it’s just a show. I don’t know 
what it is—I couldn’t say. What I say doesn’t make it so and it 
doesn’t make it not so; it’s either so or not so to start with. But, 
to me, it’s just a show. 
They don’t believe in speaking in tongues—unknown tongues they 
call it. I know the scripture speaks of the unknown tongue and all 
that in certain places, but the unknown tongue is already spoken 
in the Primitive Baptist church. If you go and hear [the minister] 
preach and you haven’t experienced what he’s preaching about, 
that’s unknown tongues to you to start with. That’s where the un¬ 
known tongue comes from.

[Primitive Baptists don’t believe in snake handling.] I know Paul 
did that. Paul was even bit by the worst snakes there were. But, 
you see, that was to be put on record to show God’s power. 
We got an old Lystra church book here—1803. It says on the 
first page that twelve people established it in 1803. Yes sir, that 
book’s that old. I’m the only member there now—only member. 
It hasn’t ever changed since I’ve known it, but the thing of it is, 
it’s gone dead, I reckon. We would have been having some services 
there maybe once a year anyhow, if we could’ve had a way to do 
it, because it doesn’t have any windows in it or anything. They’ve 
busted them all out. Back [in the old days] people didn’t bother 
nothing like they do now. I just don’t understand that. They’re tear¬ 
ing [the church] up now. Why they want to do that, I don’t know. 
You know what? Times have changed. 
When I was a boy I worked in the field. When I came out from 
school, I went over yonder and cleaned off terraces or whatever 
there was to do ’til night. I didn’t have time to run out. [When 
school was out] I knew to get home to work. You had to pick cotton 
in the fall, you had to chop cotton in the spring and things like 
that. Boys don’t have anything to do now. 
Sunday, a boy nineteen years old hung himself—a first cousin 
of mine hung himself in the bathroom. [Life] must be pretty boring 
to them for some reason. Of course, to my understanding, he was 
on some kind of pills and that might have been what caused it. 
I’ll just tell you, people can get mighty messed up. I got married 
when I was nineteen, and I worked every day at home ’til I did 
get married. You didn’t have any time to be getting out and getting 
hold of pills much; of course, you didn’t have enough money to 
buy any with anyhow. I went off many a night with a nickel in my 
pocket and I’d buy a girl a pack of chewing gum and have a date, 
too. I wasn’t embarrassed and the girl wasn’t either, ’cause they 
didn’t expect anvthinff. I would have liked to have had some money, 
but I guess I’d been in some more devilment if I had money just 
like boys are today. 
There was fifteen in our family. There were four of us boys and 
my dad would put in a couple of gallons of gas in the old A Model 
we had back then, and when you burnt that out, that was as far as 
you could go. That’s all he ever put in the truck at one time. That 
was all he could afford! Gas was eighteen and twenty cents a gallon. 
It hasn’t gone up now like other stuff has. Gas could go to a dollar 
a gallon and still be cheaper than a lot of things that’s went up. 
But you see, [gas prices are] what people harp on most, ’cause they

use more of it now than anything—especially young people, they 
can’t be still. 
The biggest sign [that the end is near] to me is how progress 
has been made in the last seventy-five years. Back before the 1900s, 
they were still knocking rocks together to strike matches and things. 
After World War II everything, approximately, is push-button. Back 
in the thirties, we didn’t have an electric stove. We still had to cut 
wood for the heat and get by with that old fireplace. [Progress] is 
the biggest sign that things are getting near the end. It’s rolling 
faster and faster—like a ball going down a hill; the further it goes, 
the faster it goes over, and by the time it hits the bottom it’s really 
rolling—things are really going. If this world was to go on fifty 
more years [we’d] be killing each other like flies just like it was in 
the old days, because there would be so much here. Maybe we 
wouldn’t be doing it on a purpose, but it would just [be happening]. 
So the end is coming on. In my day, just in my day, the world has 
changed. 
According to the scripture, we’re in the last evening now. That’s 
the way I believe, and I’ve heard a lot of Primitive Baptists say it. 
We’re in the evening of time. I do believe that. But I don’t know 
how long that’s going to go on, because, you see, with God there 
is no time. He says a thousand years is the same as one day, and 
one day is the same as a thousand years. There’s no time with God. 
So, I don’t know what the evening of time is now. According to 
history, the world’s been standing about six thousand years that 
they’ve got record of. It was probably here longer than that. Defi¬ 
nitely, every two thousand years Noah’s Ark came and the second 
Christ came. Now the third is coming up, and something is definitely 
going to happen. According to the scripture, there’s going to be a 
resurrection for all God’s children. Whenever He speaks, they’re 
all going to come forth from all parts of the earth—even the ones 
out of the sea. They’ll come forth. 
According to the scripture, there’s going to be some children of 
God here on earth when [the end] comes, and they’ll be caught 
up in the air. He’s done elected so many people. Do we say God’s 
[unjust to choose certain people]? God forbid. Didn’t the potter 
have a right to take the same lump of clay and make one vessel to 
honor and one to dishonor? So much more has God got a right 
to do that. He’s got a right to choose one and leave [the other]. 
There will be some that have to go through the sting of death. 
The scriptures say so. As far as me [knowing] when that is, He 
says, “Even the angels in Heaven won’t know.” So, as far as me

predicting when it will be, I don’t know; but I do believe we’re in 
the evening of time now. It’s the teaching of the Bible. The scripture 
is going to be fulfilled. I don’t know how you all feel. 
The old Primitive Baptists, I’m not ashamed of them at all. I 
know they’ve dwindled down to nothing, but I’m still convinced 
they’re more right than ever now. A lot of people say they fall out 
with us because we think we’re the only ones that are right. Why, 
if I didn’t think I was right, I sure wouldn’t be in it! I’d be somewhere 
else! Naturally, I think I’m right! There’s just as much purpose in 
every denomination as there is in ours. There’s a purpose in it. 
There’s a purpose in all things for the children of God.

PLATE 8 
Lystra Primitive Baptist Church 
When I was younger, I had always heard about a church near where I 
live. It was supposed to be haunted and, supposedly, if you ran around it 
three times, a witch would chase you around it the fourth time. I kept hearing 
that, so I went there one time and was going to run around it, but I got 
scared, and up to now I have never run around it. 
One weekend, years later, Wig and I went to Augusta [Georgia] on a Foxfire 
trip and we came back by my house for dinner. I had told Wig about this 
church and of some of the superstitions that surround it. He was interested, 
so I took him by there and he liked it. It was pretty run down and there 
were wasps ’ nests everywhere. Some of the gravestones were broken and pushed 
over, and the wrought iron that had been around some of the graves was 
stolen or tom down. Vandals had written all over the outside walls of the 
building. Inside, on a table, was a message that someone had written to the 
vandals telling how much the church had been loved once and asking them 
to stop. It was signed, “A person who loved this church. 
We said that even though the church was mn down, it would make a 
good article if I was willing to look into its history. He said he had never 
seen a church like this before where the benches faced the pulpit from three 
directions. He asked me if I would like to do an article on it and I agreed. 
My parents helped me find the only living member of the church and that 
was Howard Parham. So Bob Sjostrom, one of my classmates, and I went

down for an interview. Since I had already been on a couple of interviews, 
Wig let Bob and me do it by ourselves. When Mr. Parham heard we were 
coming, he went to the church and painted over all the writing so we could 
get a good picture. He carried us to the church, himself, and showed us around. 
He also showed us all the records of the meetings, as well as the plate and 
the deed to the church. I really respect Mr. Parham for going to that much 
trouble just for us. He’s really a nice man. 
After we came back, I started printing my pictures and transcribing my 
tape and finishing up the article. Now that I have learned about the church, 
I am no longer scared of going to it. It’s really a peaceful place. I wouldn’t 
even be scared there at night. Knowing about the church has drawn me a 
lot closer to it and it means a lot more to me now than just a building that 
is supposed to be haunted. 
MIKE DRAKE 
Howard parham: The church was first built over in Oglethorpe 
County across the river. It was and still is a Primitive Baptist church. 
The people moved over to this place and this building was built 
in 1820. They built it close to a spring so they wouldn’t have to 
dig a well and close to water for a baptizing hole. My granddaddy 
got baptized [in that hole] with ice on the banks. He wanted to be 
baptized right then and didn’t want to wait till the water got warm. 
[After they moved] they changed the name from Skull Shoals to 
Lystra. So this building is about a hundred and fifty years old. We

Twelve people over there established the church. They were the

Carrington the minister and John Meadows as one of the deacons. 
They were still fighting Indians when the church was established. 
At that time, there was no community and no roads. 
The most members they ever had, according to my records, was 
fifty. They only have one member now and that’s me. They had

the men sat on the other. [They] always did that. 
They had foot washings up until they quit having services. Every 
year in August they had communion and foot \vashings. We always 
called that Attracted Meeting. We had a three-day meeting in August 
and foot washings on one day. We would still do that if we still 
had meetings. Each of the brothers would wash the others’ feet 
and the sisters would wash each others’ feet. [They would] just pair 
off and that has been going on ever since the church has been there.

CLYDE NATIONS, SR., Free Will Baptists 
One day last summer while en route to one of the many interviews for this 
publication, we came upon a unique and interesting old sign. Its form was 
that of an old gigantic and genuine sawmill blade and upon it in large white 
letters were the words, “Sawmill Hill Free Will Baptist Church. ” Our curiosity 
and interest in the doctrine of Free Will Baptists then started us on a search 
of the church’s pastor and we made plans to come back into the area. 
We learned that the Reverend Clyde Nations, fr. was the preacher at the 
little church and that he also owned and worked at a little general store 
near it. When we approached Reverend Nations, he was naturally cautious 
but as soon as he found out that our intentions were sincere he readily agreed 
to share with us his philosophy and theology. Being busy, he asked us to 
come back in an hour. Upon our return we were pleased to learn that Reverend 
Nations had asked his father and Ted Laney, both Free Will Baptist preachers, 
to meet with us at the store. We were led to a small shed adjoining his store 
and as we pulled up some old Coke crates to sit on among tires and various 
and numerous boxes of supplies, we began an interview that proved to be 
one of the most informative and moving. 
Our first meeting and interview as well as other visits led to a warm friendship 
and an invitation to a revival at the Sawmill Hill Free Will Baptist Church. 
Again, we were met with wonderful cooperation and cordiality as Reverend 
Nations allowed us to record the proceedings and introduced us to the congrega¬ 
tion. From relationships like this one, we strongly feel that this particular 
publication takes on an ever greater importance and significance.

How is the government of the Free Will Baptist Church set up? 
reverend Clyde nations, JR.: We believe that the individual is a 
free moral agent. We believe that each church is a free body. My 
church is not responsible to [any other] church, neither is [any other] 
church responsible to my church. My church is not responsible to 
any organization, neither is any organization responsible to us. We 
are, somewhat, independents—somewhat. There is a Free Will Bap¬ 
tist State Association, and most Free Will Baptist Churches belong 
to it. However, up until ten or twelve years ago I didn’t know there 
was such a thing, because we’re isolated to a certain extent here 
in the mountains. But there is a state association and the state be¬ 
longs to the national association. One time I went to our national 
convention which was held down in Raleigh [North Carolina] and 
there were thirty-six hundred Free Will Baptist ministers there. 
reverend ted laney: We do now have two North Carolina Free 
Will Baptist organizations, if you remember, Brother Nations, Jr. 
Over in Durham County, eighteen thousand pulled out at once [and 
organized a separate church]. 
What was that split over? 
rev. nations, jr.: It was [within] an individual church. The big split 
came over majority rule. In other words, they had a split, they took 
it to court, and the court rewarded the minority in the church. And 
the minority who took the church was a very small minority. It was 
over majority rule—that’s what it split over. 
How are Free Will Baptists and Missionary Baptists different? 
rev. nations, jr.: The major difference between the Free Will Bap¬ 
tists and the Missionary Baptists is eternal security. 
rev. laney: The greatest majority of Missionary Baptists preach eter¬ 
nal security; if you’re saved, you’re eternally saved, and can’t be 
lost no matter what you might go out here and do. We don’t believe 
that way. 
rev. nations, jr.: The Free Will Baptists believe that a person can 
be saved and then depart from God in their actions. [A person 
can be saved, then] live a riotous life, and in the end be lost. That’s 
the major difference between Free Will Baptists [and some of the 
other Baptists]. We differ, also, on the arts of baptism and commu¬ 
nion. For instance, if you belong to a Free Will Baptist church, 
and you move to where there wasn’t any, and you wanted to unite 
with a Southern Baptist church, they would not accept your baptism. 
But if you’re a Southern Baptist, you’re saved, you’ve been baptized, 
and move into our neighborhood—or any neighborhood where there

is a Free Will Baptist church—and maybe there is not a Southern 
Baptist church handy, and you want to come and unite with the 
Free Will Baptists, then you tell us you have been saved, and you’re 
satisfied with your conversion, you’re satisfied with your baptism, 
and we will take you in on that if your life proves it. 
rev. laney: The Bible speaks of the free will. In other words, you 
by your own choice, and by your own free will have a right to accept 
Christ as a savior. You’re not forced to or made to. You have your 
own right to worship. There is nobody to dictate or tell you that 
you’ve got to do this, that, or the other. He speaks of our free 
will often. 
rev. nations, jr.: We believe that each individual is a free moral 
agent in the sight of God, therefore having the right to choose; 
the right to be saved or the right to be lost. That’s where the words 
“free will” come in. 
rev. laney: All the old people that organized this association of 
Free Will Baptists are all dead and gone. That was back when there 
wasn’t any automobiles or anything to travel with. They walked 
through these mountains and went all the way down into Georgia. 
rev. nations, jr.: They went to Georgia and got a charter and came 
back and organized the first Free Will Baptist church in this county. 
They walked! 
reverend Clyde nations, sr.: I’m a man that can’t read nor write 
my name. I thought I’d been called [to preach] for about six months, 
and finally I was on the floor testifying. I said I’d be preaching 
my first message over at the Alarka Post Office in the square Satur¬ 
day—/ didn’t say it, the Spirit of God said it. I fought it, but I was 
on the floor testifying, and He said I’d be preaching at two o’clock 
on that Saturday. It was a great experience. It’s something that I 
just about had to do. I can’t read or write, but I organized three 
churches, built two, and pastored about five. 
rev. nations, jr.: I was saved when I was twenty-one. I was preaching 
before I was twenty-two. When you start talking about the calling 
of the ministry or the decision to go into the ministry, it’s a very 
wide subject, especially in the modern times that we live in. For 
instance, let me say I was watching a national TV program on semi¬ 
naries where there was people going to become preachers. Unless 
I have forgotten, there was sixty-some percent of the young men 
in three different seminaries that had never had a personal experi¬ 
ence . . . that never had been saved . . . that never had a personal 
experience with the Lord. There were various reasons why they 

============================================================
PAGE 82

FOXFIRE 7 
were there. Some had considered the work of a doctor, the hard 
long hours, and the money. They had excluded it because of the 
obligations, and the long hard hours. Some had considered the idea 
of a lawyer, and what they had to go through with, and the money 
they would make. And they considered the ministry, and what it 
involved, and the money they would make in the ministry. Therefore, 
they decided to go into the ministry. It looked easier. That’s not 
why I am in the ministry, and not why I am a pastor. God was 
personally calling me. I was anointed, and when I use the word 
“anointed,” I speak of the power of God. There was many hours 
I laid awake. I could vision myself preaching to congregations of 
people. I visioned people being saved under my preaching and this 
is how I felt God dealing with me. 
rev. laney: As for myself, when I was sixteen years old, I felt the 
call of God. For five years, I guess I lived as rough and rugged a 
life as any man could live, fighting the calling wherein that I was 
called. I went through about any and everything that a man could 
go through with. [When I was] about twenty years old [I went to] 
a prayer meeting one evening. I didn’t get renewed back up, or 
renew my covenant with God in the prayer meeting, but it was riding 
so heavy on me—the burden—that when I got home I made my 
way through the pastured fields, about a mile over into the woods. 
There, on my knees, I made things right with God. When I walked 
into the church that night, they stopped the choir from singing, 
and the pastor said, “Somebody has been saved today.” I hadn’t 
told nobody, and nobody didn’t know it, or anything. But, he said, 
“I wish you would come on to the front and make it known.” I 
couldn’t wait no longer, and I walked to the front. As I went to 
the front, two went to the altar and got saved that night. 
Still I fought the calling of God. I taught Sunday school lessons, 
I sang in the quartet for three or four years. Every way I worked 
for the Lord other than preach. It boiled down to the last thing, 
and there wasn’t anything else to do. The load was so heavy. The 
burden was so heavy that I just couldn’t go on with it. But when I 
went down before the church that evening, I got down on my knees 
and I began to pray. I said, “Lord, if You’ll just lift this burden 
and help me, I’ll do the best I can.” I’m glad that He took it off. 
For thirty years in the pulpit, I’ve never regretted an hour of it. 
Do you see any problems in the church today ? 
rev. nations, jr.: I feel one of the great hindrances of religion— 
I’m talking about the born-again Christian movement—is to let the 
theological [differences of opinion] split the fellowship. I feel that 

============================================================
PAGE 83
============================================================

BAPTISTS 
81 
God is not at all satisfied with the fact that we let these differences 
divide us from fellowship. The unsaved portion of the world is watch¬ 
ing. We’re supposed to represent love, peace, and unity. We say 
we’re supposed to be doing this under the influence of God. 
Do Free Will Baptists speak in tongues? 
rev. laney: The Baptists don’t speak in tongues. Paul says in his 
writings that it’s better that words be spoken in a language that 
can be understood than ten thousand words be spoken in languages 
that cannot be understood. The scriptures go on to tell us, concern¬ 
ing those that speak in tongues, let them have an interpreter that 
they might interpret to the congregation that doesn’t understand. 
Now, take for instance, just yesterday I was at a funeral at the Church 
of God. I don’t know how to understand it, but practically half the 
funeral was preached in what they call the “unknown tongue.” Well, 
there was two-thirds of the people, or more, that was there that 
wasn’t the Church of God people. They all came away just as dumb¬ 
founded as I was about it, saying, “Well, what did they say?” or 
“What kind of a funeral was it?” I’m not against it, but if a man 
preaches, let him have an interpreter. Now take, for instance, Billy 
Graham, the great evangelist here of America. [He] goes all over 
the world; but, you see, let him go to the foreign countries without 
an interpreter, and get up and start preaching over there in our 
language. What effect would that have on that congregation of peo¬ 
ple without an interpreter? But, through his preaching and a man 
[an interpreter] that knows what he is preaching, and is able to 
interpret to that congregation, there’s thousands of souls that get 
saved. With an interpreter, I’d say [speaking in tongues is] all right; 
without it, no. 
REV. nations, sr.: I wouldn’t want to contradict anything that Brother 
Ted said, but not anything says, “He that speaketh in tongues, let 
him have an interpreter.” There’s different kinds of tongues, and 
there’s differences in the unknown tongue. The unknown tongue— 
no man understands it. We don’t preach against it, and we don’t 
practice it. But Paul said, as Ted said, “I’d rather speak in ten words 
with understanding than ten thousand of an unknown tongue that 
by my voice I may edify the church.” 
rev. laney: I went to a revival with two Holiness preachers. One 
of them, a real old gentleman, would preach every other night, and 
never did at no time, in no way, come with tongues. I mean, he 
preached to where everyone could understand it. But the young 
preacher . . . half his sermons the people didn’t understand what 
he was saying. We had the privilege to talk to him one night before

the services had started and we asked him about it . . . why he 
did it, or why it had come about. I’ll tell you just exactly word- 
for-word what he told me. He said, “My sister went through college 
and took up a foreign language,” he said, “and it’s through her 
that I speak these words,” he said, “and it’s not from God.” So, 
there’s where he got his, because he was speaking some other kind 
of a language that he got out of college. 
How do Free Will Baptists feel about foot washing? 
rev. nations, jr.: Yes sir, the Free Will Baptists have them. That’s 
one part of their communion service. The women wash one another’s 
feet and the men wash one another’s feet. Some of the Independent 
Baptists are practicing foot washings now. The scripture is taken 
from one of the four Gospels—which one I don’t recall right off . . . 
rev. laney: All four of them has it. 
rev. nations, jr.: It’s taken from Christ’s teaching where He washed 
His disciples’ feet and it’s supposed to represent humility. 
What are the Independent Baptists? 
rev. nations, jr.: You see, the Independent Baptists came out of 
the Southern Baptists. Do you know why? Independent Baptists 
are really just Southern Baptists or Missionary Baptists, but they 
came out because they could not support the work of the whole 
of the Missionary Baptists such as the cooperative program; in other 
words, the Independent Baptists support missionaries and mission 
work—home missions, foreign missions and so on—but they do not 
support the organization of the Southern Baptists. That’s the only 
thing. 
What is the Free Will Baptist’s stand on abstaining from movies, 
ball games, and other worldly pasttimes ? 
rev. nations, jr.: That differs in the preachers and the churches, 
it sure does. For instance, I like to go to football games and I do 
occasionally. I like to watch a softball game, and I do that occasion¬ 
ally. I’ve not been to a movie house since I was saved twenty years 
ago. Most of the Southern Baptist preachers preach against movie 
houses, and probably most of the Free Will Baptists preach against 
ball games. 
REV. nations, sr.: Speaking of the ball games and movie house, 
all of that ... he says [the policy is] all in the preacher, which it 
is. I’ve been preaching twenty-seven years. I’ve not seen a ball 
game—football, basketball, baseball—and I’ve not been to the mov¬ 
ies. I’ve set that aside. That’s the way we both feel about it. I’ll

say it’s not good to go; he says it’s no harm. We work that a’way. 
rev. nations, jr.: We don’t fight. 
How do you feel about snake handling? 
rev. nations, jr.: Now let me tell you what I think about that one, 
and I don’t mean to be comical. I pride myself in one thing, and 
that’s not being critical of my preaching friends and brethem in 
opposite denominations. I pride myself because I’ve preached for 
nineteen years. In my business here [filling station/bait shop], I 
never criticize my competition next to me—I never do. You can’t 
get one of my customers to tell you that they ever heard me criticizing 
my competition over the road. I pride myself in not doing that. I 
do that same thing in my church. You could talk to my church mem¬ 
bers; I never criticize. I don’t think God is happy when we do that. 
I’ve been a Christian for almost twenty-one years, and the Lord 
has worked marvelous things in my life, and that’s the truth. I often¬ 
times mention this in my preaching wherever I am—that I know 
God is for real because He has done so many things for me, when 
I gave Him my life, that I couldn’t do for myself. I tried to be a 
better person; I tried to be a cleaner person. I made decision after 
decision that would backfire the next day. When I actually surren¬ 
dered my life to the Lord, then He changed my life in the manner 
I’d been trying to, and I appreciate what He’s done for me down 
through the years. But what He’d have to do to get me to pick up 
a snake, I’d have to be beyond myself, I grant you. I could not 
know anything about it or I would not do it. 
rev. nations, sr.: He answered for me and, I think, for most of 
the other Free Will Baptists. I’d handle a snake, all right, if his 
head was cut off and I had on gloves! 
Do you believe in Divine healing? 
REV. nations, JR.: Absolutely; I believe that. Three weeks ago I had 
a true experience with that. I believe that God heard and answered 
prayers in behalf of a man that’s fifty-nine years old. Ever since 
I’ve been pastoring my church, we’ve been praying continually to 
see this man saved. He went to the hospital and when they did 
surgery on him, they said that there was no chance; it was cancer 
of part of his stomach and his lower intestine, and they didn’t see 
any hope. But they went ahead and sewed him back up after his 
surgery, and they kept him there trying to build him up until they 
could do surgery and take out the tumor. People kept praying and 
witnessing to him and now he’s back on his job. Three weeks ago, 
he made an open profession in church. I believe it was a divine

act of God. Yes sir, I do. But as far as me being able to walk up 
to you and laying my hands on you and saying, “I command You, 
Lord, to heal this man”—I’m sure you’ve seen some of that on 
TV or somewhere—no sir, I don’t think we have the right to do 
that. I do believe with all my heart that God hears a humble prayer. 
I don’t know of any greater medicine that I’d rather have if I was 
real sick than to know that people who believe in the Lord were 
finding time and a place to pray for me, pray for my healing. Yes 
sir, I believe in Divine healing. 
rev. nations, SR.: We do preach the fifth chapter of James. Call it 
for them, Brother Ted. . . . 
rev. nations, jr.: “If any among you are sick let him call for the 
elders of the church and they’ll anoint him with oil and the . . .” 
rev. laney: “. . . prayers of the saints will save the sick and if they 
have any sins, they will be forgiven.” 
Is part of the worship service to invite those 
desiring prayer for sickness to the front? 
rev. nations, jr.: Not mine, no sir. 
rev. laney: We have, yes, up at our church. 
rev. nations, sr.: We let them make that choice. If we’re in church 
and some feel like they desire prayer and want us to pray, we anoint 
them with oil and pray with them. We don’t ask them to come at 
any time. 
James says, “If any among you are sick, let him call for the elders 
of the church and let them anoint him with oil. The prayers of 
the saints shall save the sick and if he has any sins, they shall be 
forgiven him.” We practice that—but not as much as we used to. 
We used to keep a bottle of oil sitting in the Bible stand or some- 
wheres at all times, and if anyone asked for prayer, why, we’d pray 
with them. But, they’d ask; we didn’t ask them. Then if someone 
was to send for me to come over and pray with them, if it was 
fifteen miles, I’d go. I’d try to go believing what James said, “If 
any among ye are sick, let him call for the elders of the church . . 
REV. nations, JR.: I think the general stand of the Free Will Baptists 
is somewhat based on that one verse in the Book of James. I think 
if you were going to say something about the stand that the Free 
Will Baptists took, you’d probably do well to mention that they 
do use James’ Gospel quite a bit. 
Have you, personally, ever seen anyone healed? 
rev. laney: Yes, I have. I can take my ownself, just this past Easter. 
A little over a year ago, I had a real heart attack; but up through

the Easter weekend, there was a blood clot somewhere in my chest 
in between my shoulder and my heart. Even this big artery was 
swollen until it was as big as my finger. Well, I went through all 
the weekend preaching, and I started a week of coming to the church 
and having prayer and nothing else at night—of a night, just a solid 
week of coming to church praying. I told some of my members 
Wednesday evening, I said, “If this don’t move, I’m going to have 
to go back to the hospital and get something done.” They said, 
“If you can, wait until prayer meeting’s over tonight; maybe it’ll 
be gone.” 
During that service, God heard and answered someone’s prayer. 
Someone’s faith reached God; or maybe three or four, or maybe 
the whole congregation, ’cause when I went to the trailer after service 
was over, I was feeling some better. I went to bed and I went to 
sleep right off. I got up the next morning and had not a pain, not 
a bit of swelling, nothing. There’s not been any pains of the heart 
in any way since then. God hears prayers. 
rev. nations, SR.: When I was pastoring the same church that [Rev. 
Nations, Jr.] is pastoring now, there was a small child took sick 
and they rushed him to the hospital. They thought he was dying 
or at the point of death. We had prayer and in the next hour I 
told the folks, “I have a car sitting out there and it’s full of gas. If 
any of you think that the baby isn’t better, just get in the car and 
go to the hospital and see.” The baby had improved and came 
home the next day. We were at church and we had prayer, and in 
an hour’s time, when the service was dismissed [the baby had im¬ 
proved] . 
In three years, I’ve been in the hospital eighteen different times, 
myself. I’m a diabetic. I’ve been in there for bursitis, arthritis, and 
everything, and I’ve had many prayers prayed for me. Shortly, I’d 
come out. I’m still a diabetic; there’s never been anyone prayed 
the prayer of faith that I’d be healed as a diabetic, but as far as 
arthritis, bursitis, and all that, >vhy, I guess I’m about as limber as 
any sixty-six-year-old man. 
Did Free Will Baptists have circuit preachers ? 
REV. nations, JR.: Brother Henry Cochran, one of the first Free 
Will Baptists ministers [in this area] told me that at one time he 
used to leave the head of Alarka Creek and walk across the mountain 
and preach where I’m at—at the Sawmill Hill Free Will Baptist 
Church—on Saturday at noon. Then, he’d walk right over to the 
Almond Depot and catch a train, and ride over to Andrews, which 
is twenty-five miles on the train. He’d walk up to the Beaver Creek 

============================================================
PAGE 88
============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
River Baptist Church, which is about a three-mile walk, and have 
a Saturday night service. He’d stay all night there and get up on 
Sunday morning and walk across Atowa Mountain down into Graham 
County and have a Sunday morning service and a Sunday night 
service with them. Then on Monday morning, he’d walk out to 
Thompton and catch a train back to the mouth of Alarka, and get 
off and walk back, which is about five miles back to where he lives. 
He said he did that many times and got paid fifty cents on it for a 
round trip. 
rev. nations, SR.: Speaking of pastoring two churches, I used to 
come to Alarka on Saturday morning, preach Saturday night and 
Sunday morning, and I left to go back to Conley Springs and 
preached Sunday night and Wednesday night. I tried pastoring them 
two [which I couldn’t do now]; I’d get up at four o’clock Saturday 
morning, rain or shine, sleet or snow, come this way and preach 
Saturday night and Sunday morning, and go back down there at 
Sunday night, ministering. 
How often do you have services? 
rev. nations, jr.: We have service on Sunday morning, Sunday night, 
and Wednesday night. 
What is the purpose of revivals and singings ? 
rev. nations, jr.: A revival is to revive the individual. In other words, 
the man that’s lost and don’t know anything about the Lord, you 
don’t revive him; you work toward getting him saved. But a revival 
is to revive the individual Christian; to bring us closer together in 
fellowship with one another and God. That’s what a revival is for. 
As far as singings are concerned, there is diverse opinions on 
what the singings really do. Used to be, I think, it was much different 
than it is now. The professional end of singing, I think, is hurting 
the gospel work more than it is helping it; however, up here we 
have singings. A great deal of time you’ll get in one where the 
Spirit and power of God intervene, and people are drawn closer 
together in fellowship and love toward one another and in God. 
But, singing as a whole . . . there is certainly differences of opinion 
as to what it does really do. 
Nearly every Saturday somewhere in this county, there is a singing. 
And you’ll have ybur different groups. Most of the time, churches 
come together. One church may have a quartet or two quartets 
and a choir; for instance, the Alarka Baptist Church has two good 
gospel quartets. They’re good, too. And they have a number-one 
choir. My church has a quartet and a choir. Most of the churches

do, and on a Saturday night—any given Saturday night—somewhere 
in the county there is a gospel singing in a church. They tell me 
that they used to have a gospel singing convention on the courthouse 
lawn out here in the square in Bryson City every so often. Mostly, 
it consisted of church choirs and they had these old-timers that 
knew music real good. They had judges of the singings. They’d 
walk around and look over people’s backs and watch the music as 
they sang, and they graded them.

PLATE 19 Mrs. Selma Mosely. 
SELMA MOSELY, Black Baptist 
Mrs. Selma Mosely, a member of the Ivy Hill Baptist Church, firmly believes 
in “reading and studying God’s Word regularly. ” A Baptist and resident of 
the mountains all her life, Mrs. Mosely joined the church when she was eleven 
years old and has been actively involved in its affairs since that time. She 
has served as a Sunday school teacher, leader of the small children’s “Sunbeam” 
group, and president of the “Missionary Circle. ’’Although Mrs. Mosely never 
received any formal music or voice lessons, she serves as pianist and singer 
at Ivy Hill, crediting her musical ability as being “a gift from God. ” In 
fact, Selma came from a large family that included eleven children, many of 
whom were musically inclined. She remembers several of her brothers “picking 
up by ear” such instruments as the ukelele, accordian, and guitar. Mrs. Mosely 
strongly holds to her beliefs and faith in the Christian experience. In this 
interview she discusses her religion as being the real, sustaining force in her 
life.

I joined the church when I was eleven years old. I attended church 
[and] different church activities during all my girlhood and as a 
teen-ager. My father was a minister. [Back then] when you were 
young, you were just taught to go to church and then you played 
in different activities. I was in the choir and I was teacher of the 
intermediate class in Sunday school and then [I] was in the prayer 
service that I loved. That s really where I got converted—in prayer 
service. My father always led the prayer devotional. We had BYPU

(Baptist Young People’s Union); I was president of that. Then we 
had a Junior Young Women Circle once a week. The older women 
had a Missionary Circle. So, it kept us busy. [I was] very active [in 
the church] all during my young life even up until this present year 
of 1977. I came here in Rabun County [Georgia] in 1947, [a year 
after I married]. I was here for just a few months until I connected 
up with the Ivy Hill Baptist Church. I’ve been a member ever since 
and I’ve been active in the church here ever since I’ve been here, 
and I’ve been here thirty years. 
I try to stay busy [with church work]. When I had more youngsters, 
I organized a little club we called the Sunbeams. I went with the 
children—the girls and the boys. This went on until now it’s almost 
run out and I don’t have anything to work with. There is a little 
group now, but it seems they are not interested anymore. I don’t 
know. When the change came, it really stunned me. I prayed and 
I said, “Lord, I never thought the time would come that I wouldn’t 
have anything to work with.” I don’t know whether it was the genera¬ 
tion gap, you know. When I was working with this last young crew, 
they got to where they didn’t want to recite their pieces; they didn’t 
want to learn them. And then they didn’t want to read them. So, 
if you don’t do one of the two, there’s nothing for you to do. I 
used to have all types of programs on all different occasions like 
Christmas, Easter—different holidays. I would have programs for 
these children and we would have a real good time. I really, really 
hated when the time came that I didn’t have anything to work with. 
Now, this other little group—the last group that I’m working with, 
they don’t even bring their children to church. So, therefore, you 
can’t work with somebody when you [can’t] really get close to them. 
If I say anything to them I have to say it in the street because they 
just don’t come to church. You can’t get the message over. For a 
long time it was funny but sad—I would always invite them to come 
to church. I’d say, “God loves you, I love you, and I know the 
rest of them that come [do too].” This went on and on and then 
they got to the place when they would see me coming, instead of 
me saying it to them, they would say, “Miss Selma, we’re coming 
to church.” See, they beat me to the draw, but they weren’t coming. 
I got the message real quick. Seems like they couldn’t get the message 
when I was trying to give it to them, but I got their message. So, 
I don’t say anything to them now. Very seldom ever do I invite 
them to church because the church is right there, and they know 
the doors swing on welcome hinges. 
It’s a sad picture. It’s very sad, because I think of the young people 
of today and as I have my morning devotional every morning, I

pray for the young people. I love young people. I love people, regard¬ 
less, I just love people. You know, there is a better way than the 
wrong way. The right way is the best way. If one will accept Jesus 
Christ as their personal Savior—they should just give Him a try. 
They should find out for themselves. 
I was talking to a lady last night over the telephone. I said, “You 
know, you think about the coming of Christ,” [and He is coming 
again because He said He was]. “You think now when we leave 
this earth, we will be at the resting place until the resurrection, 
because He said the dead will be caught up at the first trumpet 
sound and that [trumpet’s] going to be for the righteous.” And 
those that are here on the earth are going to be caught up, too; 
that’s going to be the righteous. He said, “It was appointed to man 
to die and after death there is the judgment.” But there will be 
some [living] on this earth when He comes. Everyone is not going 
to be dead. So, I said, “It is worthwhile for anybody just to think 
about what the Lord promised us—life eternally.” And I said, “Just 
think, there isn’t going to be any more hatred, any more death; 
there isn’t going to be anything but peace and happiness forever 
and eternity. He promised that to everybody, not one individual 
group, not one race. He said He had no respect of person.” Isn’t 
that wonderful when you just think about it? Heaven is going to 
be here on this earth. This is God’s earth. John said he [saw] the 
new heaven and the new earth coming down, so it’s got to be coming 
down; it’s got to be here. To think that you’re just going to live 
forever and eternity without pain, without sickness ... He said 
no more tears. All of that is going to be done away with. This old 
body that we’re living in—it’s going back to the dust. From dust 
He made it and that’s where it will return. The soul is what He 
wants. He said He has a new body for us and that body is going 
to be a perfect body. Mine’s worn out anyway. It’s filled with pains 
and things. Not too many people don’t have pains with their bodies. 
You take the older people that live and have already gotten rackety, 
they’re not going to have to live in those old bodies. He’s got us 
new bodies. It’s a wonderful life. 
As I told you, I joined the church early, at eleven years old. I’ve 
not been perfect, but I’ve been trying very hard. I remember when 
I was converted. Back when I was a girl, they used to call for mourn¬ 
ers. I don’t know whether you all know anything about this or not 
because they have done away with this in all the churches. When 
you were a sinner, you went up to that mourner’s bench and the 
Christian people would pray with you. I mean they would pray with 
you a week, two weeks, or ever how long it took until you felt like 

============================================================

God had forgiven you of your sins and that you were ready to accept 
Him as your personal Savior. There were thirteen of us, I remember 
very well, and we were at that mourner’s bench about a week. Maybe 
we didn’t understand or know [why], but we were there. We felt 
something had happened and the change had come. We had ac¬ 
cepted Christ as our personal Savior and then we were baptized. 
As I said, back when I was a girl, the older women had what 
they called a Missionary Circle and they would sometimes have an 
evening prayer service. I was always with the older group. I followed 
them to these meetings. I liked that. I would sing as a girl—vocal, 
not with the piano. God gave me the gift of singing and I have 
sung in church and prayer service until I have seen those old women 
shout and almost look like they were going to tear the building 
down. You don’t see too much of that now. Back then people were 
really with it. You know what I mean? They were very active in 
Christ. Those old mothers and fathers were happy because tears 
would just be [falling]. As a girl, I said, “Lord, I don’t have what 
they’ve got, and I want it. I want to know that You are alive! I 
want to move and I want You to move me!” I didn’t want to be 
doing it on my own and faking it, I wanted to really know that He 
was a living Savior. I went to evening prayer service and, when 
they called altar, I went back [to accept Christ again]. When I came 
through that time, I understood the Lord more because I was older. 
[Conversion] was the best [feeling], honey; there is no comparison. 
There is nothing in this world, nothing that compares with it. It doesn’t 
last, and it couldn’t, because I don’t think man could stand it. You 
know, the Lord says He doesn’t dwell with man at all times. Now 
this is what you call the Holy Spirit, when He racks that marvelous 
body of yours. I mean it is something. When it’s all over, everything 
looks so new, everything is so different and you are ready—I mean, 
you let the Lord use you. You just open [your] mouth and He puts 
the words in. I mean the Lord will use you. That I know. I thought 
of the verse where Jesus was talking to Nicodemus. He said, “Nico- 
demus, you must be born again.” Conversion and accepting Jesus 
Christ is kind of like a new bom baby. You take a little baby, it’s 
going to be nursed, breast fed or either bottle fed for maybe a 
year, and then the growth just keeps coming. Directly the baby is 
going to start crawling, and after a while, it’s going to start trying 
to walk. This is Christian life. I mean, you can’t get it all at one 
time. You’ve got to grow in it. The Lord tells us, He says, “My 
grace is sufficient to keep you.” He will keep us. Then He said in 
running the race, be patient. So, we have to be patient. You just 
don’t get all of this at one time.

They [used to shout] in services. Yes sir. You don’t see that any¬ 
more. You think people now are serving a dead God, but God is 
not dead. He is alive. You know He went to the grave, didn’t He? 
He stayed three days, but He rose. He is a living God. You can 
go into church and people are sitting up just like monuments. Just 
still. If you can’t feel something, I think something’s wrong. I think 
you need to go back and ask God to give you that that will move 
you, because He is a living God and He’ll move you! You’re going 
to clap your hands and you’re going to say “Amen.” I go to churches 
and say “Amen” and sometimes people look around, and I mean 
you can see them looking. But it doesn’t make any difference, because 
when I hear the truth, you know I can witness. The Lord wants us 
to be witnesses. He doesn’t want us to be silent. He wants us to 
let the world know He is alive. He wants us to talk, He wants us 
to be active, He wants us to sing. He said, “Sing praises with a 
shout!” This is what you don’t see anymore. 
[My father] was a minister and he was the superintendent of the 
Sunday school and also of the prayer service. I’ve heard my father 
preach and I’ve heard him pray. My father lived to be eighty-nine 
years old. There were twelve of us [children]. I was the baby of 
the crowd. So there was a large family. My mother was a good 
Christian woman. She lived a very sweet life. I had a wonderful 
mother and the Lord called her at the age of sixty-three, which 
then [was old]. Now, in this generation, people [at sixty-three] are 
not old. Not even at eighty. They say the “girls” of eighty. When 
I turned fifty, I told my son, “I can remember when my mother 
was fifty, she was an old lady. Now that I’m fifty, I don’t really 
feel old. I know I’m headed in that direction, but I don’t feel old.” 
But she was old and at sixty-three she died. 
I’ve been in [prayer] service with my father. I can remember the 
first prayer that I ever prayed in public. I asked him, as a girl, I 
said to him, “Papa, I want you to call on me to pray.” 
He said, “You want to pray?” 
And I said, “Yes.” 
I was [so] looking forward to this all week I just could hardly 
do any good, because I was thinking about Wednesday night prayer 
meeting, when he was going to call on me to pray. Now, understand, 
I didn’t study any books or anything. You know, they do have books 
and it s all right to study them. I believe in studying. But I didn’t 
study a prayer. I’ll never forget that Wednesday night. I just kept 
looking at my father. I’m sure he couldn’t do any good [preaching], 
because every minute I was just looking at him to call me. Eventually 
he did call me. It frightened me so bad and I was so looking forward

for it [that], when I got down to pray the Lord’s Prayer, I went 
through the first part of it and then it just left. It just went away 
from me. I couldn’t even think of it. I knew the Lord’s Prayer, but 
it just went away from me, and I finally said, “Amen” and got up. 
I was very embarrassed and I told him after prayer service, “Don’t 
call on me anymore.” 
He said, “Yeah, I’m going to call on you again.” He said, “You 
keep praying.” 
He knew I could say the Lord’s Prayer, because back when I went 
to school, we had devotional of the morning and [we] said the Lord’s 
Prayer and the Twenty-Third Psalm in concert. I guess it was just 
the excitement of being in public my first time. I kept praying until 
the Lord really let me pray. When my mother was sick, she used 
to call me to the room and ask me to pray for her. So, I’ve had a 
wonderful life. I’ve tried both ways. I’ve tried the wrong and I’ve 
tried the right way, and the right way is better than the wrong way. 
If anybody can accept Christ and let'Him come into their life, He 
can make a beautiful life for them. The Lord has all of this beauty 
out here, and you know, people walk to and fro in this earth and 
never see it because they’re blind to it. 
Back when I was a girl, they used to have the revival services. 
They had one week of prayer. This was to get the Christians heated 
up and ready. Then, when the preacher came in, honey, he had to 
preach. Oh, yeah! That second week those Christians were really 
on fire! That preacher—all he had to do was hit the pulpit, and I 
mean he’d preach his heart out! He had to, because it was so warm 
you could feel the love and the Holy Spirit. He had to! There used 
to be some of the best revival services that I believe I’ve ever seen. 
And the young people, I mean they would come into the church. 
And most of the time, there weren’t too many that stayed away 
from the altar, either. I mean they would come in and accept Christ, 
you know. But this is what has happened; they have taken this out 
of the church, you know what I mean? They don’t have the altar 
call anymore. They say, “You come and give me your hand and 
God your heart.” But I [think] that’s why a lot of people in these 
churches don’t have the love of Jesus. They don’t know anything 
about Him because they never really went through the part to accept 
Him as their personal Savior. Their name is on the church book— 
they are members—and the churches are full of members, don’t 
you all agree? They’re full of members. “But my name’s on the 
church book.” But, see, that’s not enough. We have to accept the 
Lord as our personal Savior. The most precious gift that has ever 
been given [was] when God gave His Son to the world. Wasn’t it?

He gave His own Son that whosoever believeth on Him shall not 
perish, but have everlasting life. So this is what He has promised 
us and I believe it. I believe every word. 
You know, I’m not a fanatic, but I try to be very religious in my 
everyday life. I want to live a good life. I want to live a life that 
will please God. Then if it pleases God, it will have to please man. 
It will just have to. Then if [man] doesn’t agree with me, I’m just 
going to go on anyway. Yeah. I don’t want to miss what God has 
promised for me, and what He promised for me, He promised for 
everybody. Everybody has this right, and this is what I really like 
about it. And this is what I tell my church people. In our Christian 
life, you don’t have to be jealous of what I do and you don’t have 
to be jealous of what the other person does, God has a work for 
every individual. A Christian family is like a puzzle—every piece 
has to fit in before the puzzle is worked. The Lord tells us, He 
says, “I’ll pay you by your works.” He said, “Behold, I come quickly 
and My reward with Me. I’ll pay each man according to his works.” 
Now He has a work for us. We don’t go in just being a [church] 
member, we have to go in and then do the work that the Lord 
has for us. You know, there was a writer that wrote, “If you can’t 
sing like angels, and if you can’t preach like Paul, you can tell the 
love of Jesus that He died for all.” That’s so true. See, everybody 
can tell that. It s just a wonderful life. I’m going to tell you what 
the Lord said. I know you’ve read it, you’ve heard it. The Lord 
said, “Seek ye first the Kingdom and My righteousness and all things 
shall be added.” 
[After the revivals, we’d have baptizings] on the river banks, you 
know. Of course, now people have pools in the church, but back 
[then] you were baptized in a creek! Or a river, you know. I mean, 
honey, they would be lined up on the banks. It was just beautiful. 
Now when I was baptized, there were thirteen of us. That was a 
pretty good-sized baptizing. People back then would go to church, 
and at the baptizings, the people would be lined up along the banks. 
And those old ladies, honey, and the fathers would be shouting 
and praising God. Yeah. The deacon would carry one [person] at 
a time to the minister. 
Most of the [baptizings were in the summertime] or in the fall. 
They never did baptize too much in the winter. Of course, when I 
worked at the hospital and the hotels, it was Sunday work and then 
I didn’t get to go to service [and baptizing] as much as I’d liked 
to. You know, God said He chastened those He loves. He loves 
us all, but sometimes when you think you’re getting away [from]

or not doing the things that would be pleasing to God, something’s 
going to happen. I’m going to show you what happened to me. 
I was working [on Sunday]. I sent my money, but see, that wasn’t 
enough. You don’t pay in. He didn’t say we were going to pay 
through. He said He was going to pay us by our works. I was sending 
in the money, but I was out there working. You know, I was stricken 
down in 1968 with phlebitis, and I laid for one year before I could 
walk. I thought I wasn’t going to walk anymore. I had a lot of time 
on my hands, I had a lot of praying, I had a lot of crying and 
talking to the Lord. And after the doctors and nurses did all they 
could, the Lord healed me. It’s been ten years and I’m not able 
to work anymore, not full time. I had to go on disability. I broke 
down at the age of forty-eight, so I was young. I wasn’t old enough 
for social security, but I could get disability. The Lord has been 
good to me these [ten] years. He’s let me know that He is the Way- 
maker. I thank Him because I haven’t had to beg. Not a day. He 
said, “I will supply your needs.” He didn’t say my wants now, my 
needs. I thank Him. I’m grateful, and I think these years have put 
me closer to the Lord than ever in my life. 
I really, truly believe in healing, because I’ve been healed so many 
times. I’m not a person that runs to the doctor too much. I’ve been 
healed by people coming in praying for me and I’ve been healed 
just talking to Him, myself. 
[Years ago] a lot of the young people, if they got in trouble or 
depressed or felt like they needed somebody to talk to, would come 
to my father or he would go to them. All he wanted to know was 
if they needed him. He always tried to lend a helping hand and 
reach out for someone. This is my main goal. I think a lot of my 
father and, of course, of Mother, too. I know their prayers helped 
me through life. I know I’m not the best person in the world, but 
I’m not the worst. If I hadn’t had Christian parents [who] disciplined 
me and pointed out that the way of the cross leads home, I probably 
would have been a worse person than I am. I probably wouldn’t 
even be living for the Lord. Finding Him at an early age and being 
in a Christian home [with] a Christian father and a Christian mother 
helped me through life. It’s really helped me. 
Older people used to help one another with their children. If 
they saw your child do something, why, if they didn’t whip you, 
they’d make you think they were going to whip you, and they sure 
were going to tell your parents. You were going to get the whipping! 
So you got it from your parents. But, you know, people are running 
away from that. They could see somebody’s child out here fixing

to kill one another [and they’ll say,] “I’m not going to get involved. 
I’m not going to say anything. It’s none of my business.” And this 
is the way the world is going, and this is bad. This is bad. If I 
didn’t know you, and I saw you doing wrong, I’d like to say some¬ 
thing. To let you know that you’re just doing wrong. You might 
not accept it. Sometimes I think if we got involved a little more, if 
would be a better world to live in. You know, I have a song, the 
title is, “If Everybody Was Like Jesus What a Wonderful World 
This Would Be.” Everybody is not going to be like Jesus. But there 
are some that are trying to get like Him. I think this is the main 
goal. When the Lord saved us, He saved us to help save somebody 
else. He doesn’t want us to be selfish. He wants us to spread His 
love and help people. This is my main goal. I love to reach out 
for somebody and do something or say something maybe to help 
somebody. 
You know, when the Holiness came into North Carolina, my father 
and mother were the first people that opened the door for them. 
The little Holiness church that they have there now started in our 
living room in [Canton] North Carolina. They went from the little 
church—a plank church—to a big rock church. But it all started 
from my mother and father’s living room. They were for [the Holi¬ 
ness church] and [they] went to the altar and kind of got saved 
and got live with it. 
I went through it! We just stayed members in the Baptist church. 
Papa knew it was right because he was a minister. He had preached 
and he just got stronger in the Lord. They could speak in tongues, 
and my mother could, too. I’ll tell you, they shouted the floor out 
in our living room. They had to put a new floor in it. They wor¬ 
shipped in our living room for two years. Over two years, and out 
of our living room went the Holiness church. It was Black, but now 
the whites and the Blacks congregate together and they have a won¬ 
derful time. See, I’ve been away from home a long time, but I go 
back every otice in a while. They have a beautiful church. Everybody 
comes together now. Everybody is [a member of] his own church, 
but they do come together. Just like [our] church out here. We 
don’t have any white members [and] over town they don’t have 
Black members, but every so often, we can get together. All of God’s 
people can get together. 
I’ve had tny feet washed. If I can still remember, it seems like 
this was something like an altar call, you know. They’d get them 
up there, [and] they’d take off the stocking and the shoe, and I 
reckon this really shows the love that you have for your brother

or sister. You know the woman in the Bible ... I guess this refers 
to what she did for Jesus. You know, she washed Jesus’ feet with 
tears, and He was talking about the love that this woman had in 
her heart for Him, and no other one had offered to do this. This 
shows humbleness, too, to humble down to wash your feet. They’d 
just sing and pray, and they had these towels ... it was something 
kind of on the order of taking the Lord’s Supper. This kind of 
goes together. You could just feel the love running from heart to 
heart and, as they say, breast to breast. You can really feel love. I 
think we [should] get back to those kind of things like having a 
family altar with a Christian foot wash. I’m talking about the Chris¬ 
tians now, and this is where it should begin. The Christian needs 
to get more involved and active. You know, there’s scripture in 
the Bible where the Holy Ghost came in on people and they said 
they were drunk but they weren’t drunk on alcohol, they were drunk 
on the Holy Ghost. I think a lot of us ought to get drunk on the 
Holy Ghost. 
I’ve heard of [snake handling and drinking poison], but I haven’t 
ever been in one of those types of meetings. I quote this scripture 
where the Lord says you can eat it or drink it and it will not hurt 
you, but you’ve got to be in the Lord. But you know, there have 
been people bitten out here from this snake handling. I wouldn’t 
want to pick up any snake, because I’m scared of it. 
Back when I was a girl, they had dances. They’ve always had 
dances. The dances have changed, just like everything else has 
changed. I look at the young people on the television dancing, [and] 
it’s beautiful. They’re doing more exercise—they’ve gotten more 
[physically] active than I guess we [were]. We didn’t do all of that. 
I heard somebody on the television say they’d like to see the fox¬ 
trot. They did that back when I was a girl—fox-trot, Charleston, 
two-step, jitterbug—that was the names of the dances they had. 
Everything has changed. The girls and the boys used to dance to¬ 
gether. The waltz, that was very popular. You find them doing that 
every once in a while, but most of the time they just single. Just 
everybody out there on the floor jumping, jerking, and a’ hopping. 
It’s all right. It’s just different. The style of the girl’s hair [has 
changed] and the boys wear the long hair. My mother used to braid 
my hair and she would wrap it. They used to say this would [make] 
your hair grow and mostly that’s what we were wearing it for, but 
we would take this stuff off and take it down on Sunday and style 
it in some way. But life kind of repeats itself a little bit on the 
styles, the fashions, the hairdos and things. My father wore a mous-

tache. The older men used to wear the thick moustache and kind 
of twist it at the end—kind of twirl it up. And they wore the little 
goatee on the chin. 
[The church looked down on our fashions and dances a little 
bit.] I think they’ve always done that. The churches were kind of 
strict but they would talk to us and tell us. A lot of times we’d 
think [to ourselves] or say to another young person, [that] they 
were meddling or something like that, [but] you didn’t say it to 
the older people. You just didn’t let that go out. I mean, you respect 
people and you respect old people and the churches. The young 
people were young and [the old people] would say, “You’re going 
to sow your wild oats.” I guess you’ve heard that version. But when 
you get the wild oats sowed, you’re apt to be through with that 
part of life. I think this is true. I don’t think you can take young 
people and make old people out of them. In this age [the] young 
have so much to confront them. It looks like [life has] more to 
offer you all than it [had] to offer, say, back in my generation. So, 
this is why I pray so hard for the young people, because I’ve been 
young. We all have. We’ve been through that stage—one way or 
the other, we had to get through it. We have to pray for these 
young people and help them to get through that stage. After you 
get over that, life can be beautiful. You’re going to learn more 
about life. Of course, some people never get through with it. You 
take some of these old people, [they] still have to do things they 
did back when they were young. Trying to repeat life! I [say] that 
doesn’t make sense. You don’t repeat it, you just keep going forward. 
I see a lot of them trying to repeat it, but that’s not really good. I 
was telling the taxi driver the other day, I was telling him I didn’t 
want to repeat life, but there would be a lot of things maybe I did 
coming through that I wouldn’t have done [if I’d known then what 
I know now]. I’d try to make it a better life. But I don’t want to 
go back and repeat what I’ve done. No, I want to look forward. 
We know what we’ve done in the past, but we don’t know what 
the future holds. But we do know who holds the future. 
[I think we’re living in the last days, now.] I really do. According 
to what the Lord has told us, He said, “When [you] see these signs, 
you look up and know that your deliverance is drawing nigh.” And, 
according to the Bible, we can look up and expect God anytime, 
because we are in the last days. We are in them. According to God’s 
Bible—and I read that Bible, and I don’t say “daily” because I don’t 
do it in the day, I do it at night. I read that Bible every night. I 
search God’s Holy Word and pray constantly, and then at times

I get the encyclopedia and I get my dictionary on the Bible, and I 
try to run reference. I believe in people studying God’s Word. Paul 
told Timothy, “Study to show thyself approved unto God,” so, I 
believe in studying. We [should] notice the things that God has 
told us and the signs that He has given. He tells us as you see the 
fig trees and the leaves, the winter and the summer, then [those 
are] some signs. He says when you see these things happening, 
just look up and know your deliverance is drawing nigh. I’m looking 
for it. He says, “Not even the angels in Heaven know the time.” 
But He says, “Watch and pray.” So, we know not the minute or 
the hour the Son of Man cometh, but He said, “Be you also ready.” 
Just be ready. He isn’t going to give us any warning. He’s already 
told us everything He’s going to tell us. It’s up to us now.

PLATE 20 Mrs. Beulah Perry. 
BEULAH PERRY, Black Baptist 
In Foxfire 3, students, Beverly Justus Phillips and Vivian Barrel, introduce 
Beulah Perry as “one of the most beautiful people we have ever met. ” Mrs. 
Perry is indeed that and more and we deeply value her friendship and support. 
As well as an extensive personality article that appeared in Foxfire 3, Beulah 
Perry has been featured many times in our magazines and books, aiding in 
our research on a great number of topics. We have documented her making 
baskets out of white oak splits with Aunt Arie Carpenter; she has given us 
recipes for cooking possum and told us how to dye cloth with various wild 
plants; she has told us of her remembrances of old comcob-pipe-smoking mid¬ 
wives and granny women; and she has proved invaluable help with her informa¬ 
tion on old-time burial customs and the care of animals. 
Most important, however, to Beulah Perry are her religious beliefs and 
her association with her Baptist Church and her relationship to God. Beverly 
and Vivian also relate in Foxfire 3 that “her belief in God and the Bible 
are the main forces in her life. She was brought up in a very religious atmosphere 
and these qualities shine through. ” We are again pleased to feature Beulah 
Perry, this time in a religious context; a woman who is a living example of 
the Christian faith and ideal.

My grandparents died when I was about twelve or thirteen years 
old. My grandfather was a slave in his day. I don’t know where he 
came from over in Africa. He was free by the time my mother was 
born. The people who had owned him gave him a little piece of 
land, about twenty-five acres. That sounded like just a garden spot

then. The different white people would take a little bit of his land, 
and maybe another one would move in and take a little more, so 
eventually Grandfather wound up without any of it. 
My parents were farmers. There were nine of us and I was the 
second child. We stayed on a big plantation; and then after we all 
grew up, my father bought a little place. I was raised on a farm 
and we had a good time. When I look back on when we were young, 
it seems like we had more fun than the young people do now. We 
had more leisure time. 
We had six months of school a year, three months one time and 
three months another time. When it came time to work the crop, 
school would close. Then it would open again when we were through 
working the crop. 
We went to church. That’s one thing we did. You know, that’s 
something that gets away with me now. My father and mother carried 
us to church and Sunday school, and now there’s so many young 
people that don’t even go to church, much less Sunday school. It 
seems so strange to me to see a mother and dad with four or five 
little kids and not taking them to and from church. We were raised 
up to go to church. On Sunday evenings we didn’t do like children 
do now—running around. We played and had fun but it wasn’t 
loud. It was quiet on a Sunday. We recognized the day as the Lord’s 
day, so we had fun but it was in a calm kind of a way. 
I was converted when I was nine or ten years old. I never will 
forget. There was a revival going on and when I was a kid, the 
parents carried the children to the altar. They’d have altar calling 
and the parents would carry their children to the altar. The preacher 
talked that night and said for the people to pray for everyone and 
that the Lord would bless us. 
The next morning I went to get water from the spring for my 
mother. On my way to the spring I got to thinking about the meeting 
that night. I thought about what the preacher had said. As I was 
coming back [to the house], I set my bucket of water down and I 
prayed. I was in a little patch of pines about as big as these two 
rooms. Then something just happened. I didn’t know what it was. 
I couldn’t quit crying. I just felt good. I knew I was happy and 
tears kept coming. I went on to the house and I carried my water 
in, set it on the table, and Mother noticed something unusual about 
me. I don’t know what it was unless it was the tears or my eyes 
[which] were red. I hurried out the door. But my mama called me, 
“Beulah, wait a minute. What’s the matter?” She said, “Come here.” 
I went to her and I told her I didn’t know what was wrong. 
I said, “I was coming on back from the spring and I stopped 

============================================================

and prayed, and I reckon I got happy.” I said, “I can’t stop crying.” 
As I was talking to her, the tears were coming down and she 
said, “Well, the Lord has blessed you. You’ve been converted.” 
Mama took her apron and wiped the tears away, and she said, 
“You’ve been wanting to join the church. You can join now. When 
you join the church, you have to be a good girl.” 
So the next day or two one of the elderly ladies in our church 
came to visit Mama and I was in the kitchen, so I heard Mama 
telling about what had happened to me. This lady said, “I told 
you the other day that child was converted and to let her join the 
church. Now you let that child join the church tonight.” 
I’ve been a Christian ever since. My mother and daddy were Meth¬ 
odist. We were all bom, raised, and converted in a Methodist home 
but we moved out to a community where there wasn’t any Methodist 
church. There was only a Baptist church and the Baptist people 
wanted us to join their church. We talked to Papa about it and he 
said it was all right to join. He said, “The church ain’t gonna save 
you. All God wants is a pure heart.” He said, “It’s nice to be in a 
church but when you’re in a church, do right. If you ain’t gonna 
do right, there’s no need of joining a church.” So we joined the 
church there. We were just raised up to believe that way. I guess 
I was about thirteen when we moved out of the community and 
joined the Baptist church. 
I always wanted to be missionary and still, yet, I’d like to be one. 
Every once in a while I sit down and I think, “Sometime I’ll get 
to go to Africa yet.” Maybe it’s just that I want to go makes me 
think that I’ll get to go. I was talking to Reverend Letson, the Baptist 
preacher in town, and he said sometimes when we couldn’t get to 
go places like we wanted to do, God had a mission here at home 
for us to do and just to do everything I could for the Lord and 
He would understand the rest. But I always wanted to be a mis¬ 
sionary. 
My father had an uncle who sold his little plantation and went 
to Africa (he and his whole family) when I was about ten or eleven 
years old. I wanted to go with them. One of the girls and me were 
good friends and I wanted her to tell her dad to let me slip off 
with them. She told her daddy and he told me, no, he couldn’t do 
that—that it would break Papa’s heart. He said, “Now you be a 
good missionary here at home and someday you’ll get to come to 
Africa.” 
I haven t got to go yet and you know, I think sometimes the Lord 
always has had it so. [Sometimes when] we want to go to places, 
[if] we 11 stop and do some little something around where we live 

============================================================

103 
that will help somebody else, that’s a part of a mission. I think 
sometimes, “I may not go, but if it’s God’s will or had been His 
will, I would have gone.” There’s a mission around us. There’s 
something around here I can do and the Lord knows I can do it 
better here than I could anywhere else. He had a purpose for it. 
Back when I was a little girl coming along, we had those big 
revivals every summer for about two weeks. We just had preaching 
and singing and praying and church things. [There was] prayer meet¬ 
ing every night and maybe two or three of the elder people would 
testify, different ones singing and praying and telling about their 
conversions. There was calling to the altar and praying for people. 
We didn’t get to have our [revival] this year. We were building 
the new church. I have really missed it—it’s kind of like you don’t 
feel right when you don’t have that revival. I hope we get to have 
one next year. I like church. You know, it’s hard to get away from 
the way you [were] raised, isn’t it? 
Some of the rich people’s churches don’t make as big a to-do 
as we poor peoples do. They have a kind of dignity or something. 
They have their [church] meeting but it’s just mild and in a quiet 
way. Some of them, not all of them, are that way and some of them 
just let the Lord use them in a big way like we do. Now you take 
the Holiness churches and the Black people’s churches. Those 
churches and ours have church pretty well alike. We just have a 
big time. I don’t know that you do get as much out of those quiet 
kinds of services. I guess the word of the Bible is strengthening 
to us. 
We do go around to different churches and they come to ours 
for different meetings and things. One night another church had 
their Saturday night singing at our church and it was such a glorious 
thing. That’s one thing about the people in different churches, they 
will come to the other’s rescue. They will do that and I think that 
is the best thing there is. I think when God comes to get His church, 
He won’t just get certain people. He wants all of those pure hearts; 
that’s what He comes for and I think about that a lot. When God 
comes back and gets His children together, they’ll be from every¬ 
where—every church and nation. That’s a glorious thing.

And I tell thee this is my turn, 
that thou art Peter, and it is upon this rock 
that I will build my church; 
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it . . . 
Matthew 16:18-19 
The Catholics represent a comparatively new denomination in 
the mountains but one whose numbers are steadily on the increase. 
In Rabun County, for example, during the last twenty years, the 
Catholic church has grown from a few members to several hundred. 
Other Catholic churches in small towns near here also show substan¬ 
tial growth. 
To a large extent, Catholics reflect the newer population content 
of the mountains. Many Catholics, such as Lina Davis, who is pre¬ 
sented in this section, came into non-Catholic mountain areas and 
realized a need for their own church. As Mrs. Davis points out, 
more and more Catholics became established in this area, for reasons 
including business and recreation, and thus the local church was 
bom. 
We feel that the Catholic Church is a strong force in the religious 
community, continuing to grow and add members, be they new 
converts or others moving in. As religious acceptance and tolerance 
take hold, the Catholics can look forward to productive and positive 
times ahead.

Lina Davis, a member of the Catholic church, represents one of the newest 
denominations in our mountainous region. Mrs. Davis was bom in central 
Italy and lived much of her childhood in Milano, the second largest city of 
that country. During World War II, she met and married John Davis, an 
American soldier, and they returned to the United States in January 1947. 
Mr. Davis is a practicing attorney and Mrs. Davis is actively involved in 
community volunteer service, including work with young people’s organizations

her church and explains in the following interview how this particular Catholic 
congregation came into existence and grew strong in this area. 
KEITH HEAD 
When I first arrived in Rabun County from my native Italy in 
January 1947, there was no Catholic church or Catholics living in 
the area. The closest Catholic church was sixty miles away in Gaines¬ 
ville. I attended mass in Franklin, North Carolina, [where] the Sun¬ 
day services were held in a private home. 
In 1956, Walt Disney arrived to make a movie, The Great Locomotive 
Chase, with a crew that was largely Catholic. The crew worked hard 
seven days a week and had little time to travel to North Carolina 
for mass, so the Bishop of Atlanta gave special permission for the 
Franklin priest to offer mass in Clayton. By this time a few more 
Catholics had settled in the area and after the Disney people left, 
mass continued to be offered in Clayton. 
For a place of worship the parishioners had the use of the Commu¬ 
nity House or the Legion Hall. There were very few members; but, 
in the summertime, tourists increased attendance at services to be¬ 
tween 100 to 130 people. Then, one day, as a miracle, a church 
in Pennsylvania decided they wanted to do something in the mission 
field and chose to build a much-needed Mission Church in Clayton, 
paying practically all the costs. In November 1961 the proud congre¬ 
gation attended the first service in their own little church. As time 
passed companies from northern states relocated in Rabun County, 
bringing along personnel and the parish grew from fifteen families 
to forty-five and is continuing to grow. 
The pastor stays pretty busy. Besides St. Helena in Clayton, he 
serves also St. Mark in Clarkesville, and provides religious services

at the reform school in Alto; and with the assistance of a nun, teaches 
religious education for adults and children during the week. 
When I first came over and the church wasn’t here, I went to 
[the Baptist] church with my husband. A few times I was sitting in 
there with a lump in my throat because of the things they were 
saying about Catholics in the church. I was thinking to myself, “that’s 
not true,” and I turned to my husband and said, “but that’s a lie.” 
Finally I quit going. After the people got to know me and after 
they saw my beliefs arid they saw the way I felt about the church 
and how the church came in, you wouldn’t believe the change that 
came from them toward the Catholics. In fact, now I don’t even 
feel we are any different. [You see much more cooperation.] Now 
older prejudice is gone—I know it’s gone. The Episcopalians went 
through the same thing when they came in. But, you know, the 
Episcopal is just like the Catholic, except their ministers can marry 
if they want to and they don’t recognize the pope as their leader. 
You can go in an Episcopalian church and you think you are in a 
Catholic church. 
It is amazing how the presence of a church can change the mental¬ 
ity in a community. I remember how friendly and kind the people 
were when I arrived in 1947. Nonetheless, there was bigotry and 
hostility toward the Catholic religion, which began to change only 
after Catholic worship began in the county. Then people began to 
show tolerance at first, then respect and finally full acceptance. 
My husband is a Baptist deacon. It works out beautifully, and 
we let our children choose what they wanted. As they were growing 
up, I sent them to Sunday school at the Baptist church before we 
had the [Catholic] church here. They wanted to know why Mama 
didn’t go to the Baptist church and I explained it. And so they 
asked me, “Why can’t we go with you?” 
I said, “Fine,” so they came [with me] and they were happy. So 
all my children are Catholic. My daughter is married now to a Baptist 
and there is no Catholic church [where they live], so she goes to 
church with him, which is fine to me. As long as she goes to church, 
I’m happy. 
In Italy, when I was growing up, 90 percent [of the people] were 
Catholic. We knew there were Jews and Protestants, but they were 
just a word to us. They never taught us in school—you see, religion 
was a subject in school like geography and history—we didn’t know 
anything about anything. For us, people were people. When my 
husband, when we were starting to marry, I knew he was Protestant, 
so we went for the application to get married and, for the first 
time, the priest said, “Well, you know your husband is Baptist.”

And I said, “So?” 
And he said, “Well, you know you can’t [marry]. You need the 
dispensation.” 
That was the first time that I knew that I couldn’t marry another 
faith. But, it was easy. We made the application, went through the 
pope and we had permission. [Dispensation] is getting permission 
to marry someone of another religion. It was no problem. Usually, 
at that time, they made the parents sign that the children be raised 
Catholic, but we didn’t sign; we weren’t asked. My parents were 
more concerned that he was a good boy. My mother said she hoped 
that I would stay with my religion. It never crossed my mind to 
change. 
Our belief in God is generally the same as Protestants, maybe 
the rituals differ. If you stand and we kneel, there is a difference 
like that; but it doesn’t make much difference. We believe on the 
consecration of the bread and the wine. We have real wine; we 
just barely wet the lips. 
We were often accused of worshipping the statue and idols. Still 
now, we hear about it. We Catholics have pictures [of Christ] in 
our home and the crucifix and pictures of Mary. But, if you take 
the youth today, they have their rooms full of Elvis Presley and 
this and that. Why can’t there be a picture of Christ? Or a statue 
of Mary? I’m a fan of those, and why do we have to be criticized 
for it? 
We consider Mary as somebody special because she is the mother 
of Christ. I was told by some people here that she is a woman 
like us. I say, “No, she’s not a woman like us. She’s special. She 
was Christ’s mother.” I do pray to Mary to intercede for me. To 
pray for me. We don’t worship Mary and say, “Hey, Mary, make a 
miracle.” We ask her to pray for us. We believe in the Trinity. 
We believe that Mary is a holy person. I pray to God, but every 
once in a while, I say, “Mary, please help me.” I turn to her like I 
would turn to, let’s say, my mother. I say, “Mother, help me.” But 
my mother is a mortal and Mary, to me, is in heaven. God is the 
one we really pray to, but we just ask for the help of Mary. 
We have saints, but these saints existed. That doesn’t mean that 
we worship St. Francis and ignore God—they are just soldiers of 
God. They are an inspiration to us. Their lives were an inspiration 
to us. We try to follow their example. 
[We do believe in purgatory.] In the Catholic doctrine, purgatory 
is defined as a condition of temporary punishment for those who 
depart this life guilty of lesser faults. In the scripture we read, “But 
I say unto you that every idle word that man speak they shall give

an account thereof in the day of judgment.” (Matthew 12:36.) It 
is holy and wholesome to pray for the dead that they may be loosened 
from sins. 
As Catholics, we do believe that, in order to be saved, we must 
believe upon the authority of God—the truth that God has revealed. 
Our Protestant friends believe that God has given us the means 
to know what He has taught—the Bible. But the Catholics say that 
at the time of Christ, the Bible had not been written. Christ did 
not say “sit down and write the Bible and let every man read and 
judge it for himself.” He sent His apostles throughout the world 
to teach and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Ghost. Jesus never wrote a line of scripture nor 
did He command His apostles to do so, except when He directed 
St.John to write the Apocalypse 1:11, but He ordered them to go 
and teach all nations. At the time the King James Version of the 
Bible was authorized, seven books were omitted, so our Bible has 
[these books]. 
All religions outside the Catholic Church teach that the Bible is 
their rule of faith and men cannot be saved without the Bible. But 
the Bible was written fifteen hundred years after Christ. Errors were 
made during the many translations, consequently it has been inter¬ 
preted in so many ways that five hundred different religions were 
founded, all quarreling with one another about the true interpreta¬ 
tion. 
History says that Christ founded His church. In laying the founda¬ 
tions, He spoke to the apostle Peter and the recorded words are, 
“Thou are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church.” He 
did not say, “Martin Luther, upon you I will build my church,” 
nor did He say, “Upon you James, or you Joseph Smith, you will 
build my church, the Mormon Church and so on.” It is not possible 
to believe that Jesus founded a church and then, after fifteen hundred 
years approved five hundred contradictory sects founded by such 
men as the above. Jesus said His church will never teach errors, 
John 20:23. 
[Our priests don’t marry] because Christ, the great exemplar of 
the clergy whose ambassadors they are, was not married. St. John 
the Baptist, eulogized byjesus as “the greatest man born of woman,” 
was not married. Also, being free from family responsibilities, they 
can completely dedicate themselves and their work to the church. 
There are different orders of priests—Franciscan and Dominican. 
They are all highly educated—they are all university educated, many 
of them have a doctorate. When they become priests, they take a

vow of poverty. They barely survive; they don’t suffer, but they 
have just barely the necessities to go on day by day. 
They have to take the vow [of priesthood] three times. Between 
those three times, time goes by and they make their life pretty strict 
and miserable—to see if they are strong enough to take it. Halfway 
some of them change their minds. 
Our priests have to keep secrets. If a priest’s brother is accused 
of a murder and the real murderer goes to that very priest and 
says, “Look, I did it,” the priest cannot go to court and say, “Look, 
my brother didn’t do it—so and so did it.” The priest can’t, for 
any reason—even if he has to die, even if his own life is at stake— 
he cannot break the secret of confession. [If the priest has someone 
confess that they are going to commit murder], he can tell the person 
that is going to be killed. He can say, “Look, you are going to be 
killed, so watch it.” But he cannot reveal who said it. It is the secret 
of confession. 
Nuns also don’t marry. When they take the vow, those are the 
rules that they find, so they have to accept it or leave it. I would 
be in favor of them to marry. I feel like that if they let them marry, 
we would have more priests now. Because some of them want to 
be priests, but at the same time they want to have a family and 
children. 
[Catholicism in Italy is much like it is here.] We were very strict— 
as a matter of fact, too strict, until Pope John XXIII. He was a 
marvelous, beautiful human being. He was down to earth. For exam¬ 
ple, confession—[now] we don’t have to [be confessed] if we don’t 
want to. We believe that confession helps to put us in a state of 
grace as we approach to receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. 
On the day of His resurrection, Christ said to His disciples, “Whose 
sins you shall forgive they are forgiven.” Consequently, to the de¬ 
scendants of the disciples, the pastors of churches, God has given 
the power to absolve (John 20:23), providing we have sincere contri¬ 
tion and repentance. We have to confess mortal sin before we go 
to communion. When I’m through with confession, I feel so relieved. 
We believe in miracles. There’s nobody like Catholics that believe 
in miracles. We have the Bible and I try to understand the best I 
can. But sometimes I interpret things on my own. Now I don’t believe 
literally in Adam and Eve. That’s my mind. That’s left up to us. I 
question lots of things, but that is normal. For me, religion is the 
way you live your life—it doesn’t do any good if you are Catholic 
or Baptist or whatever if you are rotten. It’s your everyday life, to 
me. That’s what religion is, to live a good, clean, fear-of-God life.

In the morning bright and fair? Are you sowing the seed of

Simply, the Church Of Christ maintains that its purpose is to 
restore New Testament Christianity, and moreover, it is the conten¬ 
tion of those making up this church that theirs is the same church 
that was established by Jesus Christ, in approximately a.d. 33. Ac¬ 
cording to spokesperson Wayne C. Rawlings, who is presented here, 
the Church Of Christ does not and will not compromise with those 
from other denominations concerning many Christian theological 
beliefs. Here Mr. Rawlings explains the views of the Church Of 
Christ, placing emphasis on the concepts of restoration of New Tes¬ 
tament teachings. He also discusses the role of missions in bringing 
the Church Of Christ to areas such as our own. 
PAUL F. GILLESPIE 
WAYNE RAWLINGS, Church of Christ 
This interview with Wayne C. Rawlings, minister of the Clayton Church 
of Christ, needs little introduction. Here Mr. Rawlings presents the beliefs of 
the Church of Christ in a straightforward manner. He states that the purpose 
of the Church of Christ is to restore New Testament Christianity—the religious 
teaching of fesus Christ Himself. He places much emphasis on the belief that 
the church is “not a denomination” and “has no part of a denomination. ” 
He perceives his church as being the only “true” church and sees denomination- 
alism as something confusing and unpleasing to God. 
Mr. Rawlings is originally from Maryland, leaving there in 1951 to serve 
six and one half years in the military. In 1958, he became “a New Testament 
Christian” and one year later he married Sandra Daugherty from Chattanooga, 
Tennessee. In 1973, after fifteen years in the appliance business, he decided 
to become a gospel preacher and began preaching part-time in addition to 
attending school. 
The Church of Christ was established in this area in 1974, and Mr. Rawlings 
came here shortly after that time. He feels that mission churches, such as 
this one, are extremely important and that the Church of Christ is generally 
making great strides all across the country.

PLATE 22 Sandra and Wayne Rawlings. 
I am Wayne C. Rawlings, the minister of the Clayton Church of 
Christ. The Clayton Church of Christ has been in [Rabun County, 
Georgia] for approximately four years. The reason why we are here 
is to restore New Testament Christianity just like you find in the 
Bible. The Church of Christ is not a denomination. It has no part 
of a denomination. The Church of Christ is the Body of Christ, 
Ephesians 1:22-23 and a^so Colossians 1:18. These scriptures state 
that the church is the body of Christ. Christ is the head of the 
church which He purchased with His blood, Acts 20:28. The church 
is not an accident, like some people teach. There are certain religions 
that teach that the church was an afterthought in the mind of God. 
They go on this theory that God was going to establish a kingdom. 
Well, God did do exactly that; he established a kingdom which is 
the church. The church was in the mind of God before the foundation 
of the world, Ephesians 3:9-11. And through the church, God was 
going to make known his manifold wisdom. 
It all goes back to the beginning of time when man sinned. God 
created man, and God gave man and woman an opportunity to 
serve Him, but man sinned—he was disobedient. From that disobedi¬ 
ence, man was to die spiritually and physically. At the time they 
disobeyed God’s command in the Garden [which was] not to eat 
of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed and 
partook of the forbidden fruit; they died spiritually right there. Physi¬ 
cally, they died many years later like we do today. There is going 
to be death and judgment. Everybody will stand before the judgment 
seat of God and give account on how they lived on this earth. And 
how we accept God’s Word will [determine] where we will go for 
eternity. God did not leave man in the dark, however, when he 

============================================================
PAGE 114
============================================================

112 FOXFIRE 7 
sinned. God said, “I will make a plan.” That plan was going to be 
through Christ and through the church. 
The Church of Christ is the oldest religion in the world. It had 
its beginning just as Isaiah prophesied, Isaiah 2:1-4 and Daniel 2:44. 
Isaiah said from the mountain of Jerusalem His word would go 
forth. Daniel 2:44 says God would establish a kingdom that would 
stand forever. Well, that prophecy in Isaiah and Daniel was fulfilled 
approximately a.d. 33 when the church was established in Jerusalem. 
Jesus established it. Because when you read the Bible in Matthew 
16:18, Jesus told his apostles he would build his church. Between 
Matthew 16 and Acts 5, the church was established. When you read 
Acts 5:11, it says, “and fear came upon the whole church.” Of course, 
the church was the people. That’s the definition of the word church. 
Ecclesia [comes from] the Greek word meaning to call out—those 
that are called out of darkness into the kingdom of the Body of 
Christ. The word church and kingdom are interchangeable. The 
definition of kingdom is reign, rule, or government. When you accept 
God’s plan of salvation in the Bible and obey it in its completeness, 
then you let Christ reign in your heart. In other words, the kingdom 
of Christ reigns in your heart. Christ rules—and I’m not talking 
about the heart that pumps blood, but the mind. In the New Testa¬ 
ment, the word heart means mind. The church and kingdom is the 
same institution, it’s the Body of Christ. It had its beginning in 
around a.d. 33, and Jesus Christ gave his apostles all authority on 
what to teach. And so we in the Church of Christ follow the apostolic 
teaching which Jesus commanded the apostles to teach. In Acts 2:42, 
it says those that were baptized on that day, about 3,000 souls, 
continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, “to 
the breaking of bread and the prayers.” That is what we do. We 
follow that pattern just as it is recorded in the New Testament. 
So, the Church of Christ had its beginning in Jerusalem in approxi¬ 
mately a.d. 33. It is the oldest religion in the world, and it’s the 
only religion. It’s the only faith, the only church, and so the church 
that I am a member of and others in Rabun County are members 
of, follows the pattern that God has given us to follow. 
After the church was established and started growing, people went 
everywhere due to the persecution of the Christians—even in the 
first century when the church was started. They went into Sumeria 
and Judea and then you could say the uttermost parts of the earth. 
Paul went down through Asia Minor and Macedonia and even into 
Rome. And how the church got established in Rome no one knows, 
but if you read Acts, chapter 2, you see that on the Day of Pentecost, 

============================================================

113 
there were fifteen nations represented there and one of those men¬ 
tioned was Rome. Evidently some of the Jews there from Rome 
on the Day of Pentecost were converted to Christianity and probably 
went back and established a church there. Not a new church but 
the church—the body of Christ. When they obeyed it, they became 
a member of the church. The church grew in the first century [and 
it spread throughout Europe]. It was suppressed by Catholicism 
but continued for a long time, and then in the seventeenth century, 
Alexander Campbell came from Scotland as a Presbyterian, if I’m 
correct. They came to a new world, America, and they studied the 
scriptures. They could see what they were taught and believed was 
wrong, and so they made a plea to go back to the Bible. And so, 
up through Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee, and even some parts 
of Georgia, they made a plea to the early pioneers to restore Chris¬ 
tianity—to leave their denominations and go back to the Bible. There 
is a difference between reformation and restoration. Wesley and 
Calvin and Luther were more concerned with reforming the Catholic 
Church. They were on the right track. They knew Catholicism was 
wrong and they tried to reform some of their ideas. But before 
they completed their work they all died. A lot of things the Method¬ 
ists, Presbyterians, and Lutherans practice—those three men said, 
“Don’t do anything in my name, but give all the glory to God.” 
They didn’t want any Methodist church started—or any Presbyterian 
or Lutheran church. They wanted to stick with the Bible. Alexander 
Campbell was one of the early pioneer Christians that really went 
back to the Bible to restore Christianity. It started moving and more 
people started reading the Bible. 
The strongest parts for the Church of Christ now are Tennessee 
and Texas, but the Church of Christ is going into all the world, 
as Christ commanded in the first century. As time moves on, there 
are people who are concerned about New Testament Christianity, 
and they are leaving their homes and going out and reaching these 
people. The reason why the church took so long to get here in 
north Georgia is because the members of the Body of Christ were 
negligent in carrying out the Great Commission. I can’t apologize 
for that, and I’m not going to compromise it either. They just failed 
to carry out God’s command. So, we are here in this area trying 
to get the people to read the Bible. It’s hard because no one ever 
heard of the Church of Christ. It is not a new religion—it is the 
only religion according to God’s standards. I don t say that to be 
boastful. I say that because we are to obey God rather than man. 
We are here to restore that, and I plead with people on the radio. 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
If you listen to the radio program, you know I challenge people 
to read and to see what God’s Word says about religion, instead 
of what this man says or what that man says. We take it all back 
to the Word of God. 
I don’t think the Church of Christ was met with hostility when 
it came in. The church was established in 1974, and I made a visit 
up here and preached for them one Sunday and I found everybody 
friendly. They were well-received and I am well-received today. Peo¬ 
ple are searching for the truth. It was pointed out to them what is 
the truth, and they obey the gospel. The only way a person can 
get into the Church of Christ is by obeying the gospel. 
No one can join the Church of Christ. [You simply] accept Jesus 
as the Son of God and submit to baptism and have your sins washed 
away. There’s no big emotional thing or waiting period or voting. 
When a person comes to the knowledge of the truth, they accept 
Jesus as the Son of God. They submit to baptism and are immersed 
in water. Between the time they go under the water and come up 
out of it, that’s when God operates on them. You believe He will 
wash away all your sins. Jesus adds you to his church. No one does 
it for you. If a person comes in this door right now and says they 
have been studying the Bible and found that the Church of Christ 
is the true church and they want to be baptized for their remission 
of sins, well, I can’t reject them. I don’t have that authority and I 
will attend to their needs, which is baptism, and God adds them 
to His church. 
Missions are important. We need to go back to the first century 
again. Jesus told his eleven apostles—Judas had already committed 
suicide—He was on Mount Olive, and before He ascended back 
to heaven. He told his apostles, “You are going to receive power.’’ 
He wasn t talking to anyone else. They were the ones to receive 
the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. He said, “You are going to 
receive power, and you are going to be My witnesses. First in Jerusa¬ 
lem, then in Judea and Sumeria, and then in the uttermost parts 
of the earth.” New Testament Christianity began just like Jesus said 
it would [in] Jerusalem, where the church was started. The persecu¬ 
tion took it into Judea and Sumeria; then Paul went into the uttermost 
parts of the earth. Colossians 1:23 said everyone in the known world 
heard the Word preached in that first century. Everyone—thirty years 
after the church had its beginning, everyone in the known world 
heard the gospel. They all didn’t believe it, but they heard it. We 
are to take the gospel into the uttermost parts of the world. 
Christ is our head and we have no earthly headquarters. Our

ll5 
headquarters are in heaven. In reality our citizenship is in heaven. 
Christ is the head of the church and He has set up His organization. 
We have no conventions, symbols, councils, or anything like that. 
Each congregation is autonomous or self-governing. Each congrega¬ 
tion should have elders, deacons, teachers, evangelists, and then, 
of course, members. We don’t have elders here because it is a new 
work. We don’t have anyone qualified to serve as elders. In order 
to be an elder of a church, one has to meet the qualifications found 
in ist Timothy, Chapter 3, and Titus, Chapter 1. The scriptures 
teach, in Acts 14:23, that every church is to appoint elders to oversee 
the work. Those elders are subject to Christ only. They oversee 
the work and they have to answer to God on every decision they 
make, so they’ve got to be absolutely sure that they’re right. This 
is God’s pattern. And even though this congregation here is sup¬ 
ported out of Chattanooga, Tennessee, those elders in that congre¬ 
gation cannot tell us what to do up here. They can suggest things 
but they cannot tell us how to do things. They walk by faith, believing 
that I am going to teach by the New Testament. So they have faith 
in me as a minister that I will fulfill my responsibility and teach 
nothing but the word of truth. They cannot demand this and that. 
So each congregation is autonomous, but we work and cooperate 
with each other. 
A preacher has no authority in the Church of Christ—elders rule, 
men that have been selected and are qualified. Deacons are under 
the elders and they are servants—that’s what the word means. Some 
denominations have deacons that oversee the work and that is con¬ 
trary to the teachings of the Word of God. They can make sugges¬ 
tions to an eldership, but they are subject to the elders. A preacher 
is subject to the elders. In the Church of Christ, a preacher is a 
member of the Body of Christ and all he has done is give up secular 
work and [become] a full-time evangelist. That is the only difference 
between myself and another male member here. I have no more 
authority than he has. I have given myself wholly to the Lord. 
People have taken the verses about the handling of snakes out 
of context, Mark 16:17-20. Jesus was talking to the eleven apostles 
then. He had just given the great commission to them—to go into 
all the world and preach the gospel unto every creature. He said, 
“Now, if you believe—you see some of the apostles disbelieved even 
after the Resurrection, so He’s still talking to the eleven—He said, 
“If you believe, you can go and handle snakes, handle fire, and 
drink poisons.” Here’s the clincher and the purpose, “And they 
went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them

FOXFIRE 7 
and confirming the word with signs following.” So the purpose for 
that was to confirm that the apostles were preaching the Word of 
God. That’s all it was for. So the only way anyone could receive 
these miracles was for the apostles today their hands on them. But 
it couldn’t be transferable. God gave these people these signs and 
wonders to do to convince people. Now, if I lived back then and 
they laid their hands on me, I could go out and do those things. 
But, see, I couldn’t give it to you if you lived back there. The apostles 
had to do that. So when the last apostle died and the last man 
who had had hands laid on him by the apostle died, well, no one 
else could do it. So no one else today could do it. You can read 
ist Corinthians, Chapters 12, 13, and 14 and it talks about the mirac¬ 
ulous gifts. So there is no one living today that lived in the first 
century. And so there is no such thing as people handling snakes. 
They do it today, of course, but how many have died from it? Well, 
that doesn’t prove your faith; that shows your stupidity and igno¬ 
rance! I’m not going to pick up any rattler to prove my faith, because 
I prove my faith by my works. And my works don’t include picking 
up snakes. The people who handle snakes say they can perform 
miracles, but they are using religion for personal gain. 
I believe in Divine healing, however, because I pray for it every 
day. But there is a difference in Divine healing and what we call 
miracles. A miracle is something against the natural resources of 
life. God has set the world in its pattern, and a miracle is something 
supernatural. I mean if you came in here with one arm and I was 
a faith healer and I would restore [the other] arm, it would be a 
miracle. But praying for people that are sick, Divine healing from 
God can come about. We pray for Divine healing or healing from 
God. The prayers of righteous people, as James says, availeth much. 
Speaking in tongues is again one of those spiritual gifts given 
to the apostles that’s been done away with, because it ceased like 
the [other] gifts. When the apostles died and the ones in contact 
with the apostles died, it ceased. Tongues was just another language. 
They talked to people in their own language. There were fifteen 
nations assembled on Pentecost. Historians say there were three 
million people there that day and all different languages [were repre¬ 
sented]. The apostles, through the grace of God, spoke in all the 
languages and everyone heard and understood. 
[The Church of Christ] has services on Sunday mornings and 
nights and Wednesday nights and any other time we want to meet. 
We have gospel meetings, vacation Bible schools, and we cooperate 
with and support other Church of Christ meetings in other towns.

CHURCH OF CHRIST

Our worship is according to the pattern—we have preaching and 
the Lord’s Supper every Sunday like the Bible teaches. We’re to 
listen to God and not change it because we think it ought to be 
another, certain way. For example, we don’t have mechanical instru¬ 
mental music in our worship because it is contrary to the teachings 
of the Word of God. So we don’t use it. We do have an instrument; 
our instrument is our heart. We don’t have mechanical instruments 
and there is a lot of discussion about that. There shouldn’t be be¬ 
cause the scriptures are plain. We do have songbooks and the Psalms. 
We are to sing melodies in our heart and the Psalms, spiritual songs. 
Psalms 23, for example, is a spiritual song. Anything to glorify God— 
that’s the purpose. You can get beautiful music out of those Psalms. 
I want to emphasize that [the Church of Christ] is not a new 
religion. I can’t help but to say that we are the only church. If we 
are to please God, we’ve got to be a member of that church. I’m 
confident that if anyone will sit down and read [the Bible] they 
will see that. Because, I know. I was caught up in this any-denomina- 
tionalism, and God was not happy with that. God is not a God of 
confusion. All of these religions cannot be right. Somebody has 
got to be wrong, so I will take my stand on the Word of God. I’ll 
listen to what God says to me through the Word, and I’ll apply it 
to my life. 
If everyone would go back to the Bible, everyone would be a 
member of the Body of Christ which is the church. There would 
be no denominational religions whatsoever. Anywhere. This is what 
Jesus prayed for. I believe sincerely that what we practice is truth 
and truth can be found in the Word of God. Everything I say can 
be found in that Book. We ought to pattern our lives after that 
Book.

It hardly seems possible that the Episcopal Church, with its formal 
structure, would gain a foothold in the southern Appalachians as 
a strong religious denomination. Episcopalians, however, did quite 
well in establishing churches in the mountains, and efforts such as 
those of Reverend Rufus Morgan, whose life work is presented in 
this chapter, greatly furthered their acceptance, growth, and prosper¬ 
ity in this region. 
The story of Reverend Morgan, who has contributed to articles 
in previous volumes of Foxfire, is largely self-explanatory. Basically, 
he describes his religious upbringing, his education, which includes 
seminary studies in the city of New York and Ph.D. work at Columbia 
University, and efforts in beginning and revitalizing rural Episcopa¬ 
lian churches. 
Reverend Morgan’s endeavors were met with a great deal of enthu¬ 
siasm by many inhabitants of the mountains. His accounts of these 
experiences represent a significant religious history of the Episcopa¬ 
lian movement. 
PAUL F. GILLESPIE 
RUFUS MORGAN, Episcopalian 
Reverend Rufus Morgan, retired Episcopal minister, has been a close per¬ 
sonal friend of many of us here at Foxfire for several years. He has also 
proved to be an invaluable source and contact for our publications, having 
his life story appear in Foxfire 4 and aiding us in our research on “Old- 
Time Burials ” that formed an extensive chapter in Foxfire 2. Many of our 
readers are already quite familiar with this man who, at ninety-five years of 
age, continues to display tremendous strengths and an awe-inspiring love of 
life. J 
Because religion and a strong faith are central in Reverend Morgan’s life,

as was accentuated in the article in Foxfire 4, it was necessary for us to 
draw upon that story to present his beliefs in this particular book. While we 
have used excerpts from that chapter, subsequent visits to the home of Reverend 
Morgan and discussions about his religious experiences have added depth to 
his story of ministry and work in the mountains. 
Reverend Morgan's life is uniquely remarkable to us in many ways: He 
pioneered several Episcopal churches in his area and still ministers to the 
small St. John’s Episcopal Church near his home; until recently, he regularly 
hiked in the Nantahala Mountains and has been up Mount LeConte over 
150 times; with the help of friends and neighbors, he recently built a log 
home to replace his old homeplace completely destroyed by fire; and he displays 
a calm but confident and powerful assurance about himself and his God. In 
Foxfire 2, he says, “A Christian has hope and looks forward to being with 
Christ. The faithful servant of Christ lives on. ... I like one translation 
that I ran across a few years ago in a passage from Saint John’s gospel. 
The commentator gives us this translation: Tf any man observe my saying, 
he shall not notice this until eternity. ’ Then he goes on to explain. It’s like a 
man sitting under a tree reading a book. As he reads, a leaf falls on the 
page of the book. And what does he do? Become disturbed? No, he brushes 
the leaf off and then goes on reading. And he said that death is like that. It 
has no more significance for a Christian than that leaf which falls on the 
page. ” 
Reverend Morgan has had a special impact on many of us.

My grandmother Siler had been a Chipman before her marriage, 
and she was born in New York state of Canadian stock. She was 
brought up as a member of the Church of England in Canada; that’s 
the same as the Episcopal church in the United States. She had a 
half-sister who had married and had come down to Murphy, North 
Carolina. My grandmother came down to visit her, and she met 
my grandfather. He lived over here in this valley. 
She stuck to her Episcopal church, although there wasn’t one 
here. The nearest one was over in Waynesville, forty miles away. 
When there were children to be baptized, she would take them over 
there. Then she let the bishop know that she was here and a member 
of the Church, and that she wanted to keep her contact with the 
Church. So the bishop would call that to the attention of any minis¬ 
ters passing through and they would come by to see her and give 
her the service. 
My parents both belonged to the Episcopal church. They couldn’t 
stay away from the church of their inheritance, and it wasn’t long 
before we started services there in Murphy. My father was what 
they call a lay reader. He started the services in a room above a 
furniture store with a piano box serving as an altar. My mother 
was the organist and Sunday school teacher. My father conducted 
the services except one Sunday a month when a man would come 
out from Asheville and hold services for us. We had some neighbors 
in our community—Blacks—who had no religious instruction at all. 
Sometimes they’d be working for my mother and begin asking ques¬ 
tions, and she would teach them. Very often she would gather them 
on Sundays onto our back porch and she’d have a Sunday school 
for them. Later, somebody enabled her to buy a little log cabin 
near our house which she used for a Sunday school for the Blacks. 
In 1877, a minister finally came, Reverend John Archibald Deal. 
There wasn’t any parsonage, so Mr. and Mrs. Deal lived with my 
grandparents, and I’m pretty sure that it was in this house in which 
we sit. My grandparents had gone to housekeeping in a log house— 
one of the old-fashioned log houses with two rooms under one 
roof with what was called then a dog-trot, an open space in between 
the rooms. 
After Reverend Deal came, he began immediately to make plans 
for building a church, and it was the first St. John’s Church here. 
The land was given by my grandparents, and with the help of money 
that he was able to get, as he said, from the North (I think he 
originally came from Connecticut), and from what gifts he could 
get here, contributions of materials and labor, they built the church.

According to his record, my mother was one of the chief contributors 
to the building of the church. She was just out of prep school, 
but at that age and at that time, she gave a hundred dollars toward 
the building of the church which was quite a sum for a schoolgirl. 
And she fed the carpenters while they built the church. 
While the church was being built, there was an incident which 
is brought to my attention every time I think of St. John’s Church. 
There is a marker up there at a double grave for Chief Cuttahsotee 
and his wife, Cunstagih. [They escaped] from the Trail of Tears 
and came to my great-grandparents’ home. My grandfather visited 
them, read the scriptures to them, offered prayers, and sang hymns 
to the old man. While the new church was being built, the old chief 
died. He had requested to my grandfather that he be buried with 
the white man’s burial. So, since my grandfather was giving the 
land to the church, he had him buried there. And the chiefs wife, 
Cunstagih, died the next day. She wasn’t sick—just passed. So she 
was buried there with her husband. I am always proud of my family’s 
participation in that episode. Their graves are the most prominent 
in the St. John’s cemetery. They have a large stone for a grave 
marker. We were friends of the Indians. Occasionally, not as often 
as I’d like, I come in contact with their great-granddaughter and 
great-great-grandchildren over there at Cherokee. 
After St. John’s was built, the Episcopal church just nine miles 
over in Franklin was started, then one in Highlands, one in Cullow- 
hee, all over the place, because Mr. Deal was a very missionary- 
minded man. Another thing that he did during the expansion of 
his work was to establish a small church between here and Franklin 
for the Blacks. There weren’t very many of them here, but he was 
a very practical man, and he built the church for worship, but also 
developed work for crafts, cabinet-making, and so forth. I used to 
minister to that congregation and last Sunday I had some visitors. 
After our service at St. John’s, we were out there on the porch 
and a pick-up truck turned into the drive. This man came up with 
a bundle in his hand. He was a member of that Black congregation. 
While I had charge of the church down there, he loved rabbit hunt¬ 
ing, and would very often give me a rabbit he had killed, so that 
was what he had. He had a rabbit that he wanted me to have that 
he had had in the deep freeze and then his mother-in-law had made 
some jelly and pickles, and she had sent that to me. I keep that 
contact. When their minister happens to be away, I go down still 
and hold service for them. The man who came up from Columbia, 
South Carolina, to teach cabinet-making built various things for the

church, including a baptismal font for St. John’s. He got inspired 
to go into the ministry and he told me (he was very young when 
he came here) that he studied under Mr. Deal for twenty-three years 
before he could get far enough along to be ordained for the ministry 
in the church, and he worked in and for the church until his death 
just a few years ago. 
The time came when I wanted to go off to school, because at a 
very early age, I determined I wanted to be a minister, I guess 
largely under the influence of my mother. She probably influenced 
me more than anyone else. We shared appreciation of flowers, beau¬ 
ties of nature, that sort of thing, a very great deal. I admired her 
for her devotion to the church in so many ways. She played the 
organ; she taught Sunday school. She let me know very early in 
my life that she would like very much for me to go into the ministry. 
She told me about a prayer when I was sick with typhoid fever 
and the doctors didn’t expect me to live. She gave herself to prayer 
in addition to her ministry to me physically, and she said that if 
God would spare me, she would do what she could to give me to 
God’s service, and that had a real influence on me. 
We didn’t have any high school over there then, so I tried to 
find Some high school that I could attend by working my way. For 
a few months I went up to Andrews, the next town in the county. 
I did the chores—building fires, chopping wood, whatever came 
handy—for my board. I still remember the whistle of the local tan¬ 
nery before daylight. That was a sign to get up and do the chores 
before school. And then I also went to a school at Micadale, a church 
school outside of Waynesville, and lived in the home of the local 
minister, who had several scattered churches, and I did the chores 
there for my board. My oldest sister was teaching in this school. 
She wasn’t so much older than I, but she had gone to a preparatory 
school operated by our Aunt Lucy down at Hickory, so she was 
ahead of me more than her years would indicate. And then those 
schools didn’t prepare me to go very far. I went to the Waynesville 
High School, a public school. One year I boarded with the local 
Episcopal minister and looked after the church, sweeping it, building 
the fires, mowing the lawn, whatever came up. And another year, 
I boarded with the same sort of arrangement, with a Mr. Thomas, 
and did the milking, the fire-building, and other chores around the 
place. During the summer I would get whatever job I could—driving 
a team sometimes to haul material for paving the main street in 
Waynesville. 
Some things follow you in life. James Thomas, the man with whose 
family I was staying that winter, was a descendant of Bill Thomas, 

============================================================

123 
who was a white man but adopted by a Cherokee Indian chief, so 
he was always interested in the Indian’s plight. When the government 
hunted out all the Cherokees they could catch from these mountains, 
they finally gave up and just had to let the rest of them go. Later 
Bill Thomas asked permission to get from the Indians the little 
bit of money the government had allowed them for taking over 
their property, to buy a tract of land to settle these Indians on. 
The government gave him permission and so we have what is called 
the Indian Reservation of the Eastern Band of the Cherokees, which 
authorities say isn’t technically a reservation, because it is owned 
outright by the tribe of the Eastern Band. 
Anyway, I stayed with this family and a baby was born to the 
Thomas family. The mother was a staunch Episcopalian, and she 
asked me to stand as sponsor, godfather of this baby, Sarah. I still 
keep in touch with Sarah who lives in Waynesville. That friendship 
with the Thomases has continued to be very dear to me. 
I enjoyed those years and did better than I expected to in school. 
When it came to the year of graduation, which I think was through 
the tenth year, rather to my surprise I had an average for the two 
years I was there of 99. It was the only creditable grade I ever 
made. And, of course, being the highest grade in the class, I was 
valedictorian. I remember one event that rather embarrassed me 
at the time. I prepared my valedictory speech and then I had to 
practice it. I wanted to hear what it sounded like, and I couldn’t 
very well practice in the home where I was staying, so over across 
the creek that runs through the town, there’s a ridge and I went 
over there to practice saying my speech. One evening I was over 
there on the side of the ridge and I heard voices down below. I 
wondered who was there and what they were coming up there for, 
so I waited. They called and I answered, and they came on up. I 
found it was some folks who had a feeble-minded son who would 
get out and yell and call, and they thought I was he. I think they 
were somewhat dismayed that I was out there in the twilight saying 
my speech. 
While I was there, I had a little practice in church work and Sunday 
school teaching and then I became what we call in our church a 
lay reader. The folks in the church there at Waynesville thought 
that I could help out, so although I was just a high-school boy, I 
got a license as a lay reader. Most of my work, besides Sunday 
school, was holding service in the Black church over on the other 
side of town. I enjoyed that very much. I always had a liking for 
people of other races, whether Blacks or Indians or whomever. 
I remember once the minister got me to go over from there to 

============================================================
PAGE 126

124 
FOXFIRE 7 
Cullowhee to hold service in the St. David’s Church. The principal 
member in the church was old Colonel Davies, who was a Welshman. 
I went over and held service and the old colonel was also a lay 
reader, and he wrote to the minister in Waynesville, telling him 
that he didn’t think it was necessary for the minister to send that 
high-school boy to hold services—that he could hold services just 
as well and save the trouble. 
Well, I graduated there in 1906, and that summer I got a job 
with a lumber mill, Soco Flume Company, over on Soco Creek on 
the Indian reservation. 
Then I went, contrary to the expectation of some of my friends, 
to Chapel Hill. They thought I would go to Suwanee University 
of the South, which is a church college. But I thought since I was 
planning to be a minister, I ought to have experience with people 
who are not church-connected and who are not planning to go into 
the ministry, so I went into the University of North Carolina. 
I found it very difficult there for two reasons: The sort of high 
school that Waynesville had didn’t prepare a man for college and 
so I had to make up almost a year during my freshman year; and 
then I had to earn my way. I found that more difficult than it had 
been in high school, but with what work I could get, sweeping up 
buildings and tending fires and acting as sexton to the church, I 
managed to get through with the help of summer work. 
One summer while I was there, in 1909, the Bishop asked me 
to go to Canton, a papermill town, and start a Sunday school there. 
Because we had no church there and no church building, we rented 
a tent and called it the St. Andrew’s Tent Sunday School. Later 
on the church was built there and they took that same name. 
Part of my work there at Chapel Hill was looking after the church. 
I would build the fires and sweep out and ring the bell. One morning 
I was feeling down in spirits and I needed the communion service— 
at least I felt I did and I still think I did—which was to be at seven- 
thirty in the morning. I rang the first bell thirty minutes before 
the service was supposed to start; then I rang the second bell just 
five minutes before and the minister wasn’t there yet. In a few min¬ 
utes he came rushing in, saying he had slept late. Nobody else came 
to the service. He said, “Well, since there’s nobody else here, we 
just won’t have a service this time.’’ 
That was a terrible disappointment to me and I’ve thought of 
that a great many times when there were just perhaps one or two 
or three for an early communion. I’ve been very much pleased to 
go ahead with the service if there was just one. 
Well, I graduated from there in spite of the hardships. That was 

============================================================

125 
the hardest period of my education. Then I considered the matter 
of seminary and university work, and again I wanted to go somewhere 
besides my own local habitat. I decided to go to the seminary in 
New York City, a general theological seminary. I don’t approve of 
what the arrangement was there entirely, but it helped me very 
much. In the churches there in New York City, they get so hard 
up for qualified Sunday school teachers, they’ll pay seminary stu¬ 
dents for teaching or acting as secretary or doing social work in 
the church, and so besides the scholarship I got at the seminary, I 
got paid for that sort of thing. 
I got along very well, not making any outstanding marks, but I 
enjoyed it. I played handball at the gym we had there. I played 
basketball, but I didn’t get along very well there, because I didn’t 
know much about it and I was too rough, I guess, for the authorities. 
I got penalized quite often at it, but I did enjoy it. 
While I was there, there was a mutual arrangement (and still is) 
between Columbia University and the seminary. The seminary was 
way downtown, 20 Street and 9 Avenue; Columbia was up on Mom- 
ingside Heights. I had to go by elevated train back and forth. I 
studied there as much as I did at the seminary. The course at the 
seminary is three years, but at the end of that time, I managed to 
get a fellowship at the seminary. I was ordained deacon in Spring 
1913, and I got a job during that fellowship year at a small church 
right near the seminary as assistant rector at St. Peter’s Church. I 
had a very pleasant year there. 
The minister with whom I lived one year when I was at Waynesville 
had gone back to his native state of Vermont. He had a church 
up there in Swanton, Vermont. He invited me to come up and help 
him for the summer, 1912, while I was still at seminary. I went up 
and helped with the Sunday school; painted the church roof; various 
other things. Then I discovered that it was just out of the kindness 
of his heart that he had invited me to come up. He didn’t have 
enough work for me. So I got a job in the marble mill down by 
the Asisqua River and I worked there in the drafting room practically 
all summer. I enjoyed getting down to the river, and then sometimes 
out onto Lake Champlain in a canoe after work was over. I’d take 
a sandwich along and share it with the mosquitoes, of whom there 
were plenty. 
So I worked there until nearly time to go back to the seminary. 
When I told the mill authorities, they offered me a permanent job 
in the mill at a salary of more than I received for the first several 
years in the ministry. 
The winter before, I had met a young lady in New York. Her 

============================================================

126 
FOXFIRE 7 
family had a summer home up above Gloversville, New York, and 
we thought we were pretty much in love. Her family invited me to 
come by on my way back to New York City and make them a visit 
in their summer home. I went, going down through Lake Champlain, 
Lake George—a beautiful trip. We got to talking things over and 
her mother didn’t like the idea of her daughter marrying a minister. 
Her mother was something of a climber, and so she talked with 
me and with her daughter. She said, “I won’t allow it, unless Rufus 
will promise to do all that he can to get the best position that he 
can in the ministry.” Well, that’s not my idea of the ministry. She 
would like to have had me a bishop or something of the sort, and 
I wasn’t about to do it. So the young lady said, “Well, whatever 
Mother says, I have to do.” 
I said, “Well, if that’s the way you feel about it, it’s all over as 
far as I’m concerned.” 
So I went next morning down to Gloversville which is above Al¬ 
bany, bought a frying pan and a blanket, almost nothing else, and 
started out walking it off. I walked from there to Boston, 217 miles, 
sleeping out at night, averaging more than 40 miles a day. I got 
to the outskirts of Boston and found a restaurant and got supper. 
I had walked 43 miles that day. Then, when I had satisfied my hunger, 
I went out and looked for a policeman to inquire the way to the 
nearest “Y.” He gave me directions and then as I started off, he 
noticed that I was a little bit stiff, and he said, “Look here, fella.” 
I stopped. He said, “Have you got money enough to get out of 
here on?” 
I told him I thought I had. I still tease some of my Boston friends 
about their trying to run me out of town the only time I was ever 
there. So I toured Boston that day on a sightseeing bus and that 
night I took the boat, the Fall River Line, down to New York, back 
to the seminary. 
I was studying at Columbia University aiming for a Ph.D. in Politi¬ 
cal Science. I met most of the requirements, but I had never studied 
German. I had taken a lot of French and Latin and Greek and He¬ 
brew—never good at any of them—but I had never had any German. 
My sister, Lucy, had been at the Deaconess School on the Cathedral 
grounds there near Columbia University and I was in and out there, 
and she or somebody told me there was one of the students there 
who had studied German, lived in Germany for several years, and 
she heard that I needed German and she volunteered to help me. 
That broke up my doctorate, and I married her instead of learning 
any German to amount to anything. I never did get my Ph.D. Later,

the seminary there awarded me an honorary STD (Doctor of Sacred 
Theology), which is the only one that I ever received. 
The school at Penland was my interest when I started out in the 
ministry. While I was still in the seminary studying for the ministry, 
the man who was bishop over this section of North Carolina, talked 
over what I wanted to do, and I told him I wanted to come back 
to the mountains to do what I could here. He gave me a choice. 
The Episcopalian church had a school founded in 1842, Valle Crucis, 
in what is now Watauga County. It was first started as a training 
school for ministers, who wanted to go to work in the rural section, 
especially in the mountains. Later, it was changed into a boarding 
school for mountain girls that would train them as they would like 
to be trained, but who didn’t have money enough to go off to school. 
He offered me the choice of that position in this old established 
school or a farm at Penland, where a man had tried to establish a 
school for mountain youth and had failed to make a go of it. He 
had just planted some apple trees on it because the one at Valle 
Crucis had done so well. 
I chose Penland because it was virgin territory so far as the Episco¬ 
pal church was concerned and I could determine the policy of it. 
I had been at Valle Crucis one summer studying, intending to write 
my Ph.D. thesis on that community and one phase of the work there 
really distressed me. That was the “old clothes room” where people 
from the cities would send their old garments to be given or sold 
to the people—the so-called poor mountain whites. I didn’t like 
that approach. I preferred the idea of training the mountain people 
in things that they could make a living at themselves and give them 
a sense of dignity. 
So, as I said, I chose Penland and called it the Appalachian Indus¬ 
trial School. I spent the summer of 1913 here, although I was going 
back for further study at the seminary and Columbia University; 
then I came back in the spring of 1914. I fixed up an old log house 
there quite comfortably—it was a plain cabin. Then there was an 
old farmhouse on the place and I made it over into a school building 
with space for a couple of teachers to live and the classrooms. During 
that first year or two, we did what we could to put in plumbing. 
There wasn’t any electricity then. We bought a site down on the 
Toe River, intending to put in a power plant for ourselves and 
the community. 
We started in giving the first students, who were boys, a chance 
to work there on the farm—working in the orchard, helping with 
the plumbing, putting in a pumping station for the water, pumping

it up to the buildings. We put up a building we called Ridgeway 
Hall, and then put up a simple, but more suitable, building for a 
family than the log cabin. Later on, it was used as a dormitory and 
the people who followed me named it Morgan Hall. Instead of con¬ 
tinuing as I had planned it, a school for boarding pupils, learning 
farming, orchardry, and so forth, they discovered there was a greater 
need for smaller children from broken homes, etc., and so it was 
run by Mr. Peter Lambert for a number of years. Then the church 
felt that the public schools and orphanages were adequate to take 
care of that type of work, so this was discontinued. 
All the time I was planning with my sister, Lucy, to put in crafts, 
reviving the old hand-weaving, spinning, basket-making—teaching 
the women of the community these arts so they could earn money 
for things they needed in their home—to give them a greater feeling 
of worth. But after I had been there for four years, I felt that I 
would have to leave Penland. The bishop wanted me to travel, raising 
funds, and begging money, going to Philadelphia and New York 
and other cities in the North. There were others doing the same 
kind of thing and I was having to follow them. I didn’t appreciate 
the methods some people used, and I felt that I couldn’t do this. 
Penland continued with Lucy heading it up. She had already taken 
some training in Chicago in weaving from a Mr. Worst. Later he 
came down to Penland to help her set up additional weaving classes. 
Then she got a lady, one of the few original people who is still 
there, to do the spinning and weaving, and she trained the local 
women in some of the crafts. They were then able to do things 
that they couldn’t do otherwise—improve their houses, make cur¬ 
tains for their home, give their children dental work, and do all 
sorts of things that made life somewhat better. One of the first 
things that she did was to have a log-raising where the men came 
in and brought logs to make this log house for the weaving and 
spinning, and basket-making and other crafts. Then she worked val¬ 
iantly replacing one building that was on the property that had 
burned down, and erected a stone building that they called the 
“Pines.” Then the men helped build a larger log building that is 
still used, and of course the women helped by feeding them. 
Instead of remaining as a community project, which she intended 
it to be, people began coming to take training from outside. They’d 
learned about the school, because Lucy had to market things that 
were made there in order to purchase the materials and run the 
school. She attended the general church convention, which meets 
once every three years, in New Orleans in 1925, and took some

of the materials, articles that had been woven. I was a delegate to 
that convention so I went down and helped her all I could in the 
marketing. After that, she went to various other conventions and 
people got acquainted with what Penland was doing until, before 
she retired, people were coming from forty-eight different countries 
besides all over the United States, some to learn the crafts and 
some to teach. 
I went down to South Carolina and ministered to three small 
churches in neighboring towns for a couple of years. During that 
time, there was the flu epidemic of World War I. 
That was 1918 and I was thirty-three years old. I lived in the 
little town of Barnwell, a characteristic lower South Carolina town. 
Sherman had come through during the Civil War. He used the Epis¬ 
copal church to stable his horses. I also had churches in a little 
town south of that, much newer, Allendale, and another town about 
the same distance, fifteen miles, maybe. Each one had its points- 
of interest. They were the old South Carolina type of communities. 
There in Barnwell, soon after I came, I was to have an evening 
service. I went down to the church and rang the first bell half an 
hour before service, turned on the lights, got ready and, five minutes 
before the service, rang another bell, and nobody came. Well, I am 
rather a crank, I guess, about promptness, so I waited about fifteen 
minutes after the time for the service—no congregation. So I just 
turned off the lights, closed the door, and went on up the street. 
I met a group of the congregation. “Why, Mr. Morgan, what’s the 
matter? Not going to have any service?” 
I said, “I intended to, but there wasn’t anybody there at service 
time.” 
“Well, we were going to church, and thought we had plenty of 
time.” 
So I went back and held the service. After that, they were prompt. 
One thing that interested me there, because that’s low country 
with sandy soil [is that] instead of just digging a grave for a funeral, 
they dig it and then a brick mason builds up the walls of the grave 
for fear it will cave in. Then after the casket is in place and the 
service over, he builds an arch above it, so that it is encased in 
brick. That was quite new to me, of course. 
The school authorities where I was living in Barnwell were without 
a principal for the high school. They asked me to pinch hit for 
them. I said, “Well, provided you get a man just as soon as possible.” 
For the whole year, they didn’t find anybody else. Workers were 
scarce. So I did church work and the school work together, and

during the flu epidemic I ministered through the Red Cross and 
saw more people die, I think, that year than I have in all the rest 
of my life. I ministered to the people out in the country and in 
town, and then to the chain-gang Blacks, who lived in metal vans. 
I couldn’t see why they didn’t freeze to death. 
I went from there to Chester, South Carolina, a mill town, and 
was there for six years. Then I went to Columbia and there I was 
executive secretary and general missionary for the diocese of upper 
South Carolina. I visited churches that had been closed or without 
a minister and did various things—reorganizing congregations, etc. 
After five years of that, I became rector of St. John’s Church there 
in Columbia. I enjoyed ten years there. They had a comparatively 
new stone church, and were still in debt, and the vestry wanted 
me to jump right in to raising money to pay the debt on the church 
and on the pipe organ. I said, “Are they pressing us for the debt?” 
“Well, not exactly. There it is and we’re paying interest on it.” 
I said, “As I understood it, you called me here as your spiritual 
leader, and that’s what I propose to try to be. If we take care of 
the spiritual life, the money part will take care of itself.” 
So we went ahead and built up the work in the Sunday school 
and the congregation. I spent ten very pleasant years there. 
One thing that I remember with a great deal of pleasure. I did 
some planting around the churchyard. There were some great stones 
that had been left over from building the church and I managed, 
with some help, to get them arranged in a circle serving as seats, 
and very often we’d have our young people’s meetings there in 
that circle. I planted some roses back of the seats and later, after 
I had left, they put up a parish house right where that circle was. 
Some of my friends who were interested in flowers and gardening 
rescued one of the roses, took it home and when they had an oppor¬ 
tunity, they gave it to me, and it’s growing out here in front of 
my porch. I planted another rose there next to the church and I 
have started cuttings from it and have them growing here. Another 
thing that I did—those of us who are interested in flowers and trees 
formed a dogwood garden club and we planted dogwood trees along 
many of the streets and there at the church. 
During the time that I was there, I served also as business manager 
for our summer conference grounds, Canuga Lake, outside of Hen¬ 
dersonville. I had no experience in that sort of thing, but somehow 
we worked it out. I had had young people’s camps for the church 
in various other places before we took over Canuga Lake on an 
option. We tried it in 1928, and liked it well enough and were able

!3i 
to raise enough money to purchase the buildings and twenty-five- 
acre lake and four hundred acres of land. Fortunately we had a 
good dietician and other help. That first summer there were heavy 
rains and they washed out the dam to the lake. We had to have 
that rebuilt. 
I’ve kept in contact with many of the boys and girls. Some of 
the men have gone into the ministry; one or two have become bish¬ 
ops. It renovated the life of the youth of the church in the Carolinas, 
especially. Some came from other states. 
We would spend summers there at Canuga, except I would go 
back down to hold services at St. John’s Church. All that time I 
was homesick for the mountains, and the work in this section here 
had gone down terribly. I heard the minister at St. Agnes’ Church 
in Franklin was leaving, so I got in touch with the bishop and I 
came up to take charge of the work. 
The first day of November 1940, a very significant day in our 
church calendar, All Saints Day, was the day I returned to Franklin 
and Macon County, North Carolina. 
The work in this section had gone down, mostly through neglect 
in our church and in some of the others. We treat the country work 
as a step-child; do not support it, do not send good men, so some 
of the churches that our first ministry here in this area had estab¬ 
lished, had been abandoned, some of them torn down. I wanted 
to begin to get them on their feet, so I could reestablish them or 
establish new ones. Bishop Griffin told me, when he asked me to 
come, to take charge of the church in Franklin, St. Agnes’, and 
the Church of the Transfiguration in Highlands, and temporarily 
hold services over at Murphy. Well, that’s a stretch—from Highlands 
to Murphy—of about eighty miles. So I started in with that and 
then I saw other needs. 
The man who was conducting service at the Black church, St. 
Cyprians’, lived in Asheville and came over to Franklin once a month. 
I asked them if they wouldn’t like to have service every Sunday, 
and I gave them services. The church in Sylva was being neglected, 
so I called it to the attention of the Bishop. The next year, 1941, 
the minister who had been serving it from Waynesville resigned 
and went to Florida. So the Bishop said, “You see what you can 
do with it.” 
So I took charge of it. They had no minister and the church had 
been closed at Cullowhee, so I went over there and for the time 
being, as the church wasn’t suitable to have service, I held services 
when I could at the Student Union [at Western Carolina University].

Then I had some funds that people had given me when I left Colum¬ 
bia, and I spent about $400 just patching things up, so that the 
building wouldn’t deteriorate. Later I got the women of the national 
church to give me $10,000 to renovate the church and add a wing 
for students’ activities and meetings. 
Then I discovered that the Episcopal churches, never had a service 
over at Cherokee, and since my people had always been friendly 
with the Indians, been interested in them, I started going over there 
and finally built the church from other gifts from the women of 
the church amounting to $20,000. 
I built another church over at Murphy, a Black church, and started 
a little congregation which has been abandoned since over at An¬ 
drew’s. I knew that I couldn’t do an adequate job, but I wanted to 
start things going, and there are six of us working now in that same 
territory—eleven churches that I had charge of when I had to retire. 
I don’t think I’ve told you about my present love, which has been 
my love ever since I was born, St. John’s at Cartoogachaye. 
The first Episcopal minister came to Cartoogachaye in 1877. At 
the urging of my grandmother, the bishop sent him. He came without 
anything tangible to work with or to work on. He and his wife lived 
with my grandparents until he could get a log house built about a 
mile from here. That’s right across from where St. John’s Church 
stands. The stipend, or salary, in those days was very, very small. 
He would teach in the subscription schools—that is, people would 
send small sums to send their children. He would teach during the 
week, then minister on Sundays. The first church that he undertook 
to build was right across from where he lived in His log house. 
My grandparents gave the land, two acres, and according to his 
records, my mother was an outstanding contributor. She was just 
recently out of St. Mary’s School at Raleigh. I don’t know where 
she got the one hundred dollars to give toward the building. She 
fed the carpenters who worked on building the church. 
That was the beginning of Mr. Deal’s work. Afterward, he built 
various other churches; one in Franklin, one in Highlands, one in 
Cullowhee, one over on Shooting Creek in Clay County, some which 
have disappeared. 
The Reverend John Deal says in the preface of the book, Parish 
Register, that he went north to get money to help build the original 
St. John’s. He came in 1877 and he built the church about 1879. 
The first wedding that was performed in the church was that of 
my father, Alfred Morgan, and my mother, Fanny Siler, according 
to the records. My parents were married in 1881 and my oldest

sister was born in my grandparents’ house in 1882, and then I was 
born there in 1885. I was baptized in the church. 
It was only about six years later that my family moved over the 
mountain to Cherokee County. I remember that quite well. As far 
as St. John’s was concerned, it went along fairly smoothly until that 
first minister, Mr. Deal, retired about 1909. There is no further 
record of services there, but the congregation went down through 
neglect, mostly, of the church and I can’t find out just how long it 
stood. After the building was torn down, the place was neglected, 
and the people who had loved ones buried there—most of them 
moved the graves. There were a few left, those of Chuttahsotee 
and his wife, Cunstagih, and my mother’s grave and two infants’, 
and Mr. and Mrs. Gillespie, Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, and just one or 
two others. People supposed that the church grounds would go 
back in to wilderness and that would be that. 
While I was living in South Carolina, I heard that the church 
authorities were planning to sell the land where the church had 
been. I wrote to them and asked them to please not sell it, but if 
they did, to give me the chance of buying it because, when the 
graves were moved, some of our relatives wanted to move my moth¬ 
er’s grave and the two infants’, and I protested, so they didn’t. I 
started, whenever I could on vacations, before I moved up here, 
clearing out the underbrush and dreaming of building a church 
back. Just by raking and scraping, getting up what materials I could, 
I started the building and we held our first services there in 1945. 
I had moved back in 1940. We have continued since with just a 
handful. Last Sunday, for instance, we had seven in the congregation. 
Sometime in the summertime, there will be twenty-five or thirty. 
The church, with crowding in, will hold about forty-five people. 
I had to retire from the other churches officially when I was sev¬ 
enty-two, because that’s our age limit in the Episcopal church. So 
that’s been my only charge since that time—from seventy-two to 
eighty-nine. I say my only charge because there is another little 
chapel that we’ve finally built, nine miles beyond St. John’s in Rain¬ 
bow Springs. I’d been holding services in the remnant of an old 
school house, one room, and then the people over there, the few 
of them wanted a church. We had no money for it until 1962. We 
got together enough stone and started building just a very small 
chapel, which is an open-air chapel—no walls to it—-just a stone 
floor and stone altar, with locust posts to hold up the roof. The 
wall around the floor is high enough to sit on. During the summer¬ 
time, we hold services up there, from May to October. That cost 

============================================================
PAGE 136

134 FOXFIRE 7 
only a little over one thousand dollars to build, but I took that 
out of the offerings that St. John’s had given. 
In regard to money, St. John’s is unique in the way of a church. 
We do not take up collections as they do in most churches, except 
when the bishop is here. We always give to the bishop for his discre¬ 
tionary fund, the offerings when he is here, so in order to have it, 
we pass the plate. Otherwise, we just put a handmade pewter plate 
on the organ and those who know our custom and want to put in 
something, they put it in after the service. So there’s enough to 
take care of our expenses and to make a missionary donation to 
the church. I do not and never have had a stipend or a salary [from 
St. John’s]. 
As I grew older, about four years ago, I think, I realized that I 
couldn’t be on hand there many more years and I began to think 
about what would happen to St. John’s after I died, or became dis¬ 
abled. So I got a lawyer, a relative of mine, to incorporate the St. 
John’s Donor Foundation, in order to start a fund and make it grow 
as fast as possible for a background fund to help look after somebody 
who would volunteer to do the same thing I’ve done just to serve 
in a voluntary capacity to hold services up there after I’m gone. 
Well, that fund like the cemetery fund is not to be spent, the princi¬ 
pal, but only the interest, and since it is for the continuance of 
the work after I die, even the interest is not to be spent until I 
have to give up. 
Not long ago, a member of the church, who had been very faithful, 
died. She and her husband had volunteered to clean the church 
every little while, to repair the cushions, do various jobs that they 
saw needed to be done, and then after a while, she brought her 
tape recorder to the church and recorded the services. After her 
death, we received several gifts from five to twenty-five dollars in 
her memory for this fund. I have a friend down in South Carolina 
who, when she has a friend who dies, instead of sending flowers, 
sends a small check in memory of the friend, for that fund. So it’s 
slowly growing. If we get a gift not designated for anything special, 
we just add it to the fund. 
The present church has been used about the same length of time 
that the old church was used. In the record for the old church, 
there were eight weddings recorded. Recently, I performed the forty- 
first wedding in the present church. 
There are various things that are of interest to me. One is that 
a few years ago, I realized that people in my family would wonder 
what kind of marker to put at my grave, so I decided to make that 

============================================================

135 
decision for them. I got a lovely stone back in the mountains, got 
the monument man to put the lettering on it, and to erect the stone 
where I want to be buried. 
We try to minister to people no matter what church they belong 
to. We have people buried here who are Baptists, Roman Catholics, 
Presbyterians, Christian Scientists, whatever, but before they die, we 
try to minister to them, too. Sometimes we have groups who come 
in there asking my permission for meditations who are on a retreat, 
and sometimes they request that I give them a holy communion 
service and I do. I don’t question to what church they belong. I 
am just happy that I can minister to them in any spiritual way. That 
has been my interest so far as the church is concerned here in thqse 
latter years. 
I am quite handicapped. I’ve got to the point where I can hardly 
read at all unless I use a very strong lens, so I read the portions 
of scripture over and over again through the week to memorize 
the passage, and then I’m ready on Sunday to conduct the service. 
Sometimes I get what we call a lay reader and he will help to read 
the lessons or the songs in a service. I can’t memorize all the songs, 
so when I lead them, I choose some of the shorter ones that I 
have memorized in times past. I hold services there twice most Sun¬ 
days—Communion at 8:oo Sunday morning and Morning Prayer, 
or Litany, at 11 :oo, and then in the summertime a third service at 
4:00 in the afternoon in the Chapel of the Ascension up on the 
mountain. Naturally, I can’t tell how long I can continue but I am 
on the lookout for somebody who, after he retired from the active 
ministry, will take over on the same basis that I’ve been carrying 
on these last few years. 
I haven’t mentioned a couple of things that gratified me. One is 
several years ago, maybe twenty-five years ago, I was chosen as 
the rural pastor of the year for the state of North Carolina. This 
was not denominational but out of the whole bunch, and that pleased 
me. And after I’d been out of the seminary for thirty years, the 
General Theological Seminary from which I graduated awarded me 
the honorary degree of Doctor of Sacred Theology, and that’s the 
reason that a good many people call me “Doctor.” 
But many of those who knew me before I received the doctor’s 
degree just call me Mr. Morgan. Some of them have the habit of 
calling me Uncle Rufus, or if they are approaching my age, of course 
they call me Rufus, so I come to any of the calls. Some people 
call me other things that I do not like so well. Some call me Preacher 
Morgan and that seems to indicate that a minister doesn’t do any- 

============================================================

136 
thing but get up and preach once a week. I think a minister’s duty 
is much more than that. Some people call me Father Morgan and 
I don’t like that because Christ somewhere said, “Let no man call 
to thee ‘Father.’ You have one Father, Who is in Heaven.” But in 
certain areas of our church, the ministers encourage people to call 
them “Father”—Father Smith, Father Jones, etc., because they like 
the formality of it, the distinction of it—the old idea of the Middle 
Ages of “father confessor,” but I don’t like it. Christ’s reason, as 
I gather it from the scripture, gave instructions to keep His followers 
from being proud. Most of us like the distinction of being noticed 
by people, and if they call you “Father,” you sit up a litde straighter 
and no matter how high you go, even the Pope of Rome (that’s 
what pope means, papa, father), I don’t think it ministers to the 
spiritual humility. Christ always taught humility. When James and 
John, the two brothers, wanted special places at Christ’s side when 
His kingdom was established, He rebuked them. He said it was not 
His to give. It was for those who earned it. 
The building of this new four-lane highway has distressed me. 
And all that goes with it. I’ve sometimes said that I wish a bulldozer 
had never been invented. I can say that with a good deal of convic¬ 
tion. There is much in our present world that distresses me, because 
it seems to me that the emphasis on the part of modem man is 
exactly contrary to the standards of Christ. 
I’ve been on the radio recently on the local station for morning 
devotions. I took the very simplest thing that I could think of for 
my subject—the Lord’s Prayer. One morning I spoke on the petition 
for material things: “Give us this day our daily bread.” Not overflow¬ 
ing bins, not millions of tons for our own profit, but give us—the 
people who need everywhere, and let us realize that it’s given to us 
to supply our needs. I quoted St. Paul, “Let him that stole, steal 
no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands that he 
may have to give to him that needeth.” And then Christ: “Be not 
anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, or 
yet for your body, what ye shall put on.” 
And that, to my way of thinking, is exactly contrary to what we 
are actually engaged in now. We are beginning to discover that 
that can’t satisfy our needs. The fact that so many people are held 
for ransom is an indication that the people who are trying to get 
it from the millionaires, realize that the millionaires shouldn’t have 
it. And the hijackings are in the same category, and the scandal in 
our government is in [it]. It’s all the result of man’s being completely 
occupied in the thing that Christ told us not to do. Of course, it

leads to the downgrading in our estimation of God’s creation. In 
building our roads, we are influenced by politicians, by big business, 
by people who make the modem machinery to grade the roads. 
They grade the roads in order that man might have higher speed. 
We come up against the situation that we have, for we’ve just been 
over-reaching ourselves, cheating ourselves, by going too fast, too 
far. Yes, that sort of thing is distressing. 
Sometime back I went in to see a lawyer to get a deed made, 
giving to my daughter and her husband their part of my property. 
I have very, very little. I bought some of it for around twenty-five 
dollars an acre. A man from Florida sometime ago wanted to know 
what I would take for it. I said, “It isn’t for sale.” 
“Well, if I offered you twenty thousand dollars for this little tract, 
would you take it?” 
I said, “No, it’s not for sale, any more than my children are for 
sale.” 
“Well, I think I could get twenty-five thousand dollars for it for 
you.” 
I said, “No, it’s not for sale.” 
Well, of course, it’s for sharing. My daughter and her husband— 
he’s retiring—are moving back here and I’m giving that part of it 
to them. I love my place, and I’ve planted most of the trees and 
the shrubs and other plants on it. I’ve loved each one of them, 
and that’s what it means to me—it’s God’s creation. We go 
roughshod over the whole thing. The business people and those 
who live on business are against the idea of saving those things or 
establishing wilderness areas. Our local newspaper fights against the 
idea of wilderness areas, which might be kept for our descendants 
in all their primitive beauty and grandeur, because it will take a 
few dollars of our tax money which comes back to the county when 
we cut down the trees in the national forests. It’s that sort of thing, 
you see—we’re just in it for the dollar, for the accumulation to 
ourselves, regardless of the destruction that we’re bringing on our 
world. 
But I hope we’ll wake up in time. In the meantime, I walk along 
the trails in the Smoky Mountain National Park and my companion 
stops and he says, “Listen to the silence.” We had left the bulldozers, 
speeding cars, other machinery, down here. We go up there where 
there’s peace. 
What brought me back to these mountains was my heart. My 
mother loved them intensely, as had my grandparents and great- 
grandparents. It was just inbred. I’ve loved this place all my life.

When we used to come back and forth from Cherokee County, over 
here where the county line is marked (between Macon and Cherokee 
Counties), coming this way, we’d get down and kiss the earth, be¬ 
cause we loved it so. When we’d go back, we would get down and 
kiss Macon County good-bye. 
These last years, since 1940 to 1974, have been particularly happy, 
both within the church and in my relationships with other people 
in activities that I’ve been able to carry on—climbing mountains, 
studying God’s hand in His creation, and the increasing number 
of friends—it’s all been very lovely. 
A little question in our prayer book, in the section called “Offices 
of Instruction” is: “What is your bounden duty as a member of 
the church?” The answer is: “My bounden duty is to follow Christ, 
to worship God every Sunday in His church, to work, to pray and 
to give for the spread of His Kingdom.” And if you want it expressed 
in a prayer, I can think of nothing finer than that which is called 
the Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi: “Oh, Lord, our Christ, may we 
have Thy mind and Thy spirit, make us instruments of Thy peace. 
Where there is hatred, let us sow love; where there is injury, pardon; 
where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith; where 
there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there 
is sadness, joy. Oh, Divine Master, grant that we may not so much 
seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to under¬ 
stand; to be loved, as to love; for it is in giving, that we receive. It 
is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying to self 
that we are born to eternal life.” 
I’ve been trying to live by that.

“And ye shall be my witnesses, saith Jehovah.” (Isaiah 43:12) 
The following section is comprised of several combined interviews 
with those who are called Jehovah’s Witnesses. This group came 
to the mountains in the thirties and forties and have established 
themselves as a strong religious entity. Among other practices, they 
are known for their well-organized and persistent evangelism, much 
of it door to door, spreading their message with a variety of printed 
materials. 
Jehovah’s Witnesses arrived in this area with basic beliefs some¬ 
what different from those of the already established fundamentalist 
protestant groups. Some of these beliefs, including the refusal to 
submit to blood transfusions, the nonrecognition of a literal burning 
and fiery hell, and rejection of traditional Christmas celebrations, 
have made Jehovah’s Witnesses to some extent controversial and 
opened the way for vocal and lively theological debate. 
When we approached Jehovah’s Witnesses in this area regarding 
interviews to be conducted by Foxfire, they were quite receptive, 
and we were generously welcomed into their homes and biblical 
discussions. It is hoped that this composite of recorded visits will 
explain the basic tenets of the beliefs of this group and clarify parts 
of the doctrine that have caused Jehovah’s Witnesses to be controver¬ 
sial.

ERNEST Clark has lived in this area for seven years. He and his wife, 
Patricia, have two daughters, Cindy and Amy Clark. Ernest is self-employed 
and in the construction business. The ministerial work he does is completely 
voluntary and without pay. 
RUTH Stockton and her mother, Reppie Jones, also appear in this inter¬ 
view. Mrs. Stockton became one of Jehovah's Witnesses in 1951 and Reppie 
Jones joined and was baptized a year later. Mrs. Stockton and her mother 
were among the first Jehovah’s Witnesses in this region.

ERNEST CLARK, RUTH STOCKTON, 
and REPPIE JONES, Jehovah’s Witnesses 
ernest clark: My parents were Jehovah’s Witnesses when I was 
born; in fact they met in a Kingdom Hall. That was back in ’41, 
so I’ve been one ofjehovah’s Witnesses all my life, although I haven’t 
lived in Rabun County that long. I guess Ruth here was probably 
one of the first witnesses in the county. 
ruth stockton: I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in ’51. I 
studied briefly with a lady from Florida, and my reason for studying 
with her was because she started a study with my young sister and 
younger brother and I was curious to find out just what she was 
teaching. This was by permission of my mother; but I thought that 
I really would like to know exactly what she was teaching these 
children. I became very interested because this woman was so very 
intelligent in the scriptures. I studied with her a period of eight 
days and then continued to study on my own for about seven or 
nine months and was baptized in Atlanta. 
reppie jones (Ruth Stockton’s mother): I became one ofjehovah’s 
Witnesses after Ruth did. I was a Baptist. I was born and raised 
in the Baptist Church. I was baptized as one of jehovah’s Witnesses 
in ’52. 
ruth: Yes, I was baptized in ’51, you were baptized in ’52. I taught 
my mother the Word. 
reppie: At that time we didn’t have a Kingdom Hall. We had the

Jones. 
books and our Bible courses in my home. In a year or two we had 
a Kingdom Hall in Tiger and we had out meetings there. 
ruth: I knew of no other Witnesses except in Franklin, North 
Carolina, and I had contact with the Watchtower Bible and Tract 
Society through them, because after I became a Witness I wrote 
to the Society and they recommended that the Franklin congregation 
get in touch with me, which they did. Shortly after that, I think 
about a year after I was baptized, there were Witnesses from New 
York who came into this county and worked over a period of two 
or three months. A couple of them stayed with us over a year and 
the congregation was formed by them. 
ernest: Usually the situation with any congregation is that when 
there’s people available they send a special missionary, or we call 
him a special pioneer. That is, a full-time worker of Jehovah’s 
Witnesses. Didn’t they send one of the special pioneers here? 
ruth: Yes, a special pioneer was sent to me and the overseer of 
the congregation in Franklin was sent to me and so I received 
immediate contact. It is by contact with another person who has 
this understanding and they teach another and they teach another 
and they teach another . . . 
So missions is a very important part ? 
ernest: Oh yes, definitely so. Lots of times, as the people are availa-

ble and make themselves available for this work, they don’t even 
need any interest in the territory, they will simply move there. Some 
of these missionaries are sent out in a very formal way. They are 
allowed six months’ training in Brooklyn and they are given a definite 
assignment. They are given a meager financial help—only above 
and beyond their basic living expenses if they can’t earn enough 
locally through their own work. Then there are others who are able 
to work part time and serve part time and this would be more like 
what I called the special pioneer service, where the other is a full- 
fledged missionary where he doesn’t work secularly at all. He devotes 
one hundred fifty to two hundred hours a month, in the house-to- 
house preaching activity. They wouldn’t have any time to work. 
ruth: Basically though, you must understand that most of the Wit¬ 
ness work is done by people who receive this Truth and feel the 
need to express it to other people. This was the case of the lady 
who studied with me. She was not a special pioneer; she had this 
truth in her heart and felt the need to express it. And so wherever 
she went, she took it. And this is the way that most Witnesses are 
made, it’s by other Witnesses who feel the need to express what 
they have learned. 
ernest: Its very beginnings will help you understand how it’s ex¬ 
panded. To give you some idea, back in the early 1870s a little 
Bible group was formed in the basement of this man’s house. His 
name was Charles Taze Russell. And they started a study of the 

============================================================
PAGE 145
============================================================

JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES i43 
Bible. They had all been group members of the nominal religions— 
the Baptists, the Catholics and so forth—and I suppose the biggest 
change they made when they started studying the Bible, was their 
thinking on where people go after death, the state of the dead, 
the trinity doctrine, and teaching of hell fire. This is where they 
saw that there was a need for them to withdraw from what they’d 
been learning in the churches and they started studying. This was 
in the early 1870s. Charles Taze Russell was a prime mover of the 
group; he became the spokesman. By 1879, he’d published the first 
issue of the Watchtower. That was a hundred years ago and in those 
one hundred years it’s never missed one issue of publication. It 
was only last year that it went from the original nickel a copy to a 
dime a copy. So for ninety-nine years it stayed a nickel a copy. 
Anyway, basically, to give you an idea, he printed that first Watchtower 
in 1879 and it says here in the brochure, Jehovah's Witnesses in the 
20th Century, that “by 1880 scores of congregations spread from 
that one small one and in 1881 Zion’s Watchtower Society was formed. 
In 1884 it was incorporated with Russell as president and the name 
was later changed to what is called now the Watchtower Bible and 
Tract Society.” 
In other words, a hundred years ago it started out with one person, 
really, the one that had the idea to have this group come into his 
home. The brochure says, “By 1909 printed sermons were syndi¬ 
cated in newspapers and by 1913 they were in four languages and 
three thousand newspapers in the United States. They distributed 
books, booklets, tracts and Bibles by the hundreds of millions.” 
We’re only talking about a few thousand people back then. And 
interestingly, about the Society it says, “In 1912 they began to work 
on the Photodrama of Creation. ” The Watchtower Society pioneered 
the use of motion pictures with a soundtrack orv it. You know, they 
were right in the beginnings of the film industry. It says, “Showings 
started in 1914 with thirty-five thousand seeing it daily.” And there 
are copies of that still in existence and still being shown. My father 
was privileged to see some of these films. 
Since the 1800s the growth of Jehovah’s Witnesses has been phe¬ 
nomenal. In Brooklyn, New York, where the headquarters are now, 
buildings have been built and have been purchased, for the purpose 
of nothing other than to produce Bibles and Bible literature. Two 
thousand individuals live at the world headquarters. They provide 
their own dormitories for them. They’re all people that have proved 
themselves in the congregations and are recommended. They’re 
spiritual-type persons. The people who work in these offices only

receive twenty-five dollars a month. They’re all given room and 
board. They get twenty-five dollars a month for their personal neces¬ 
sities. And, when I’m talking about twenty-five dollars a month, 
I’m talking about from the president of the Watchtower Society 
down to the person that empties trash. Everybody gets the same 
amount. So there’s no chance for any greed; there’s no chance for 
any prestige; there’s no selfish reason for a person wanting to go 
there other than to serve his Creator. I think most of the ones there 
are young men from eighteen to thirty-five because of the tremen¬ 
dous amount of labor to go into the printing presses, and so forth, 
and the handling of the large bundles; they use the women where 
they can, where they can handle things. Anyhow, they have a tremen¬ 
dous printing organization. 
The worldwide work is directed from Brooklyn, the world head¬ 
quarters. At Brooklyn they have a governing body consisting of six¬ 
teen people. These are men who have been associated with the 
Bible and Jehovah’s Witnesses for fifty or sixty years. 
ruth: They’ve been with it for more than half of the whole time 
it’s been. 
ernest: In order to have a group of buildings like that and to operate 
it in the United States, you’ve got to incorporate. You’ve got to 
have some legal governing body. We have a legal corporation, it’s 
entitled the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Incor¬ 
porated. That is simply set up to comply with the law of the land. 
But that is not what governs Jehovah’s Witnesses. Rather these six¬ 
teen spiritual men, who have been appointed because of their abili¬ 
ties as Christians, they basically are the ones who are responsible 
for the information we read in Watchtowers, Awakes, and other Witness 
literature. 
They are the governing body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Right from 
the headquarters in Brooklyn they appoint the elders in every one 
of the 42 thousand congregations in the world. So there’s no in- 
between. Under them the world is divided into something like seven 
or eight zones—the entire world. So under them there’s appointed 
a zone overseer, then those zones are broken down into branches 
of which there are branches in most of the major countries in the 
world. At these branches many have their own printing facilities 
to print the Watchtower, books, literature, and so forth, in their own 
language. Whereas it used to all come out of Brooklyn, but now 
they’re deversified. Within the branches then, there are districts. 
For instance, one branch serves the entire United States, the Brook¬ 
lyn branch. It’s broken down into districts of which there are thirty- 

============================================================
PAGE 147
============================================================

145 
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES 
five to forty, say, in the United States. Then a district is broken 
down into circuits. And there’s an overseer over the district and 
then there’s a circuit overseer. The circuit overseer is the one we 
come closer in contact with. 
He comes around on an average of about every six months. He 
has eighteen to twenty congregations. It takes six months to go to 
each one; he spends one week with each. Usually they are married, 
but not always. Some pull their own travel trailer. Others stay in 
homes of Witnesses in the area. They move to a new congregation 
every week. You have to be dedicated to do that. 
While the circuit overseer is in the congregation, the body of 
elders meet at least a couple of times during the week with him 
and discuss the spiritual needs of the congregation—what it needs 
to build it up—and, of course, the circuit overseer’s main reason 
for being there is to take the lead in making disciples. He goes 
out and knocks on doors with us. The president of the Watchtower 
Society, he goes out in Brooklyn and knocks on doors. So, there’s 
no one above anyone. 
How are the heal congregations financed ? 
ernest: You can go to any one of the 42 thousand Kingdom Halls 
in the world and there is never a collection plate passed. Never has 
been one. We don’t even own one. We have, in the back of the 
Kingdom Hall, a little box that says, “contributions for the Kingdom 
work.’’ And there’s not the feeling pervading that everyone’s watch¬ 
ing you put money in. It’s anonymous. In other words, you could 
go to the Kingdom Hall all of your life and never put a thing in 
and I would never know it, he would never know it, no one would 
ever know it. There’s no pressure. 
What about pressure from headquarters? Is there any requirement, an obligation 
to give money? 
ernest: None. If we have more money thin we need to pay local 
expenses in our Kingdom Hall account, and if we wanted to, and 
the congregation voted by hand count, we could send the excess 
to the Society to further the preaching work. 
Don't you have to send some of it in? 
ernest: No. There is no tithing. There is no financial obligation. 
Some people, when they die, will their estate to the Watchtower 
Society. But we have no external source of money at all. And this 
is what makes it so amazing. 
ernest: I said that the president of the Society receives the same 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
146 
twenty-five dollars a month as does the one that cleans the floor. 
The reason, of course, obviously is that the entire structure is trying 
to be patterned after early Christianity. That’s its basis. We had 
to organize and incorporate to meet the laws of the nation to publish 
books and magazines; simply, it’s the law. But—you see, by everyone 
earning the same amount of money, there’s absolutely no reason 
for anyone to have any feeling of superiority. 
Of course, anyone among Jehovah’s Witnesses who is out on the 
road, as a circuit overseer, that can’t hold a full time job, has to 
have some financial help, but the help is absolutely meager. For 
instance, the circuit overseer is the one who we most totally relate 
to and he goes around to the congregations in several states. Now 
this man is allowed to apply to the Watchtower Bible and Tract 
Society for I think it’s ten dollars a month. Now you picture it— 
he’s providing his own gas, his own home, everything; and he can 
apply, if he wishes, for ten dollars. “Well,” you say, “so how does 
he make it?” Now most of these who’re out on the road are ones 
who have no savings anywhere, they just go from week to week. 
But when they’re with the congregations, the congregations know 
this, and we try to show our appreciation for them by helping them 
out. Nobody goes up and says, “Here’s ten dollars for so and so.” 
Everything’s done anonymously. 
The Scripture, I think, underlying this is Matthew 6:1-4 which 
says: “Take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men 
in order to be observed by them, otherwise you’ll have no reward 
with your Father in Heaven. Go making gifts of mercy, do not blow 
a trumpet in front of you just as the hypocrites do in the synagogue 
and in the streets that they be glorified by men. Truly I say to 
you, they are having their reward in full. But you when making 
gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right is 
doing, that your gifts of mercy may be in secret; then your Father 
who is looking on in secret will repay you.” So each witness feels 
a personal obligation to give of themselves; they don’t need to be 
solicited or begged, or to have people stand up and ask them to. 
They give freely of what they have. 
Let me ask you something. If every preacher that you know of 
now—any preacher in Rabun County, Georgia, the States, in the 
world—if every preacher’s salary from the church was suddenly cut 
off, stopped today, how many do you think would stay in the ministry? 
I’ve asked some that and they’ve said, “Well, my minister’d probably 
quit.” You can turn the same token around and say to the two 
hundred thousand ministers of Jehovah’s Witnesses, or elders, if 

============================================================
PAGE 149
============================================================

JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES 
*47 
you were to cut their salary off, how many would quit? Well, that’d 
be a ridiculous question because they’re not getting a salary anyway. 
Revelation 22:17 says: “The Spirit and the Bride keep saying, ‘Come, 
let anyone hearing come, let anyone thirsting come, let anyone that 
wishes take life’s water free.’ ’’ Also Matthew 10:8 says, “you receive 
free, give free.” And so this is why our ministers aren’t paid and 
why contributions are made in private. 
ruth: The furthest thing from my mind would be what the elder 
puts in the contribution box. And he wouldn’t even think of asking 
what I put in; it wouldn’t ever occur to him to ask me. 
ernest: No. It’s never been asked of another Witness. 
ruth: What our heart moves us to do, we do. Without being asked 
to do it. 
ernest: 2 Corinthians 9:7 says, “Let each one do just as he has 
resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God 
loves a cheerful giver.” And this is really what our stand is. 
Does each congregation have an appointed minister? 
ernest: As I said, we have elders. 1 Timothy, chapter 3, and Titus, 
chapter 1, lists the qualifications of an elder. He needs to be the 
husband of one wife, be a good teacher, and so forth. Among these 
elders, we have a presiding overseer. There’s nobody over anyone. 
The one who is the presiding overseer simply is someone who, if 
the group of elders got together, obviously, someone has to chair 
the meeting. Right? Somebody has to have the initiative to call the 
meeting. The overseer changes each year, but will always be an 
elder. The body of elders has oversight over any functions at the 
Kingdom Hall, and they especially take the lead in preaching the 
good news of the Kingdom. That’s God’s purpose for his servants 
at this point in history. 
Let me read to you the very last words of Jesus, when he left 
the earthly scene. He said: (recorded at Matthew 28:19,20) “Go 
therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing 
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy 
spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded 
YOU.” And that’s really what it’s all about. That’s why we have 
such a tremendous teaching program. 
We offer to anyone, a free home Bible study course, to anyone 
who wants it, we will come to their home absolutely free of charge. 
I think last year one and a half to two million families allowed us 
to come to their homes. We study with these folks—use their own 
Bible in their own home. They can ask questions. We spend an 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
148 
hour a week, when they want it. And this is why Jehovah’s Witnesses 
have been so successful in baptizing as many as we have. And, again, 
like I said, it isn’t just a matter of a person saying: “Well, I want 
to be baptized.” He has to meet the Bible’s qualifications. So, we 
study the Bible with them and help them make these needed changes. 
You have to be morally clean. And so, when you’re talking about 
an organization that’s grown like ours has, it’s simply the appeal 
of the Bible truth, the reasonableness of what the future holds for 
man, the Kingdom hope of living here on earth forever that appeals. 
We don’t hold church bazaars, we don’t hold church suppers, bingo 
games—we don’t have any of that. Only things that have to do with 
the Kingdom interest ever come over our platform. 
The body of elders preside over our meetings. Again, it is not 
haphazard. We have five hours of meetings, five different meetings 
during the week, some of which are combined. All the ones who 
attend—all the congregation members know exactly what’s going 
to be studied—can prepare ahead. So there’s no surprises when 
you get there. The elders handle the basic teaching parts—that’s 
why they’re elders, because they have the “art of teaching.” 
Are there any educational qualifications? 
ERNEST: No. 
ruth: We have a theocratic school in which even our overseers 
can engage and enroll if they want. 
ernest: But there’s no termination to the length of the school— 
there’s no graduation. It’s a continuing process . . . 
ruth: It last forever . . . 
ernest: The women also participate in this school, giving talks to 
others under the directions of the overseer. The men generally give 
talks directly to the congregation. These last five or six minutes 
each. For some of them it’s simply a Bible reading, with an explana¬ 
tion of that portion of the Bible. Some of the talks come from the 
Watchtower Society’s printed publications. Constructive counsel is 
given. The whole idea is to try to become fluent so we can present 
the message to people at their doors in the best way possible. 
ruth: ... to learn the most we can about the Bible in order to 
present it to others so that they can learn also. 
ernest: So when these students give their talks, not only do they 
learn from the information they have presented, but they also learn 
how to present it. Listen to some of the titles: “How could a God 
of Love Destroy the World?” “Is the Bible Really Inspired?” “Should 
Life Be Saved At Any Cost?” The talks consider everything about 

============================================================
PAGE 151
============================================================

149 
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES 
life. For example, a mother and child and the doctors’ dilemma of 
who are they going to save, the mother or the child. “Was the Church 
Built Upon Peter?” “Are Adornments Proper for Christian 
Women?” “Why Smoking Is Not Pleasing to God.” “Is the Devil 
the Evil Within Us?” “Why do the Witnesses Refuse to Salute the 
Flag?” All these are subjects that we take up and discuss and anyone 
is welcome to attend. 
And so our meetings are very informative. We discuss ways in 
which we can serve the Creator as in the scripture we read there 
about making disciples. We rehearse among ourselves; we demon¬ 
strate ways in which we can teach other people the Truth. That’s 
what it’s all about. We want to influence people to see what we 
have found. We would be selfish if we didn’t. If we think it’s so 
good, what kind of people would we be if we didn’t share it? Really, 
what is more pleasing than to think of an earth where locks and 
keys will become a thing of the past? Doctors, hospitals, ambulances, 
police, and armies, will become things of the past. Graves will be 
no longer needed. Just let your mind wander a minute—to think 
of what it would be like if we had only God-fearing people left on 
earth. And this, to us, sounds good. This is what we want; this is 
what we’re looking for and this is what the Bible promises. It’s 
not a dream. It’s the new earth that the Bible actually promises at 
2 Peter 3:13 and Revelation 21:1. 
We have no displays of emotion in our meetings. Our meetings, 
the best way I can describe them, are Bible study discussion in an 
organized way. Everything that we do is basically all pointed to help¬ 
ing us keep the command Christ gave to his apostles, to preach 
the good news of the Kingdom. (Reading) “Jehovah’s Witnesses 
are taught to try to be exemplary as citizens of the state, exemplary 
as Christians in every way that they possibly can.” They try to incul¬ 
cate this in their meetings. It’s all done in a very up and up way. 
Just like Jesus. When he would get together with them and talk to 
them, what would it amount to, really? Discussion. Like in the Ser¬ 
mon on the Mount—it was basically where he would teach them. 
And so as far as any basic display of emotion, it’s almost nonexistent 
in our meetings. , 
Do you have a definite conversion experience ? 
ernest: No. We grow in this. Some people believe in the baptism 
of infants. We feel that baptism is the expression of one to do God’s 
will. We’re saying that we’re dedicating our life to the service of 
our Creator. Children, they’re obviously not in a position to do 
that. They don’t even know what God’s will is. And so, as one studies 

============================================================
PAGE 152
============================================================

15° 
FOXFIRE 7 
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, he simply comes to appreciate 
and grow in that knowledge. And you could ask any one of the 
2.2 million Jehovah’s Witnesses in the world, “When were you 
saved?” or “What was the date of your conversion?” and you won’t 
get a date. Let’s simply say it’s just a matter of learning. It’s just 
about like if I asked someone, “When did you become a man?” 
What date would he give? What we feel so far as one’s being accepted 
for baptism among Jehovah’s Witnesses, it’s not on the length of 
time that they have studied the Bible, it’s not on how much they 
know. It’s what’s in their heart. We try to make that the prime thing. 
We believe in complete immersion. I think the Baptists believe 
in that too. We have baptisms whenever we have local assemblies 
and at our national assemblies in the summertime. It basically con¬ 
sists of a talk about what you’re doing and the Bible’s definition 
that you’re dying to your old former course of action by being buried 
in the water and coming forth to a new life. So it’s really just a 
beginning, it’s not the end of something. 
I’ll touch on just a little bit about communion, which is once a 
year. We have about a thirty-minute discussion about the new cove¬ 
nant that was made with those who will go to heaven to be with 
Christ. It’s a serious matter. The talk is given. The cup is passed 
and a prayer said. We don’t do it weekly, daily, or monthly. We 
feel that it’s like an anniversary or something—it comes up once a 
year. I’m not trying to minimize its importance. It’s most important. 
It’s the only celebration that we observe. We don’t observe Christ¬ 
mas, Easter, or any of the celebrations that the nominal Christians 
do. They have pagan origins; they are not found within the Christian 
teachings. The only one that Christ said to keep is the memorial 
of His death. He didn’t ever say to “keep the memorial of my birth.” 
Did He? 
If you go to any Witness’s home, you’ll never see a Christmas 
tree. And we have good reasons for it. I think you’re aware—all 
you have to do is read the newspaper at Christmastime. It admits 
the whole pagan background of everything—the mistletoe, the tree, 
the star, and all that. Check sometime. You’ll find December 25th 
was the worship of the Day of Saturnalia. It had nothing to do 
with the day of Christ’s birth. It had to do with sun worship. He 
wasn’t born near then. Many know that, but what do they do? They 
tell their children lies about Santa Claus and about Jesus being bom 
that day. We figure we’re going to tell our children the truth. 
ruth: They might ask, “Well, is God real?” “If Santa Claus is not 
real, is God real?” 

============================================================
PAGE 153
============================================================

JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES 151 
ernest: See. And so it spawns atheism, is what we feel. It can have 
an influence. I’ve never been given a Christmas gift because, remem¬ 
ber, I said my parents were Witnesses when I was born. Obviously, 
our children have to feel a bit of hurt at that time, but they don’t 
miss anything by missing Santa Claus. We give them gifts all through 
the year. We don’t have to wait for one day. We do things with 
them. So it’s not that they’re left out. 
Do Jehovah's Witnesses ever have churchings, excommunications? 
ruth: Yes, we do. 
How does that take place? 
ernest: What the Bible says is, “quit mixing in company with anyone 
called a brother that’s a fornicator, a greedy person, idolator, reviler, 
drunkard, or extortioner. Remove the wicked man from among your¬ 
selves.” So, what we would do if a person continues in the practice 
of sin—these are major sins we’re talking about—drunkenness, forni¬ 
cation, idolatry, reviler, extortioner—then a letter is read publicly 
over the platform in the congregation. It simply states that this per¬ 
son is guilty of unchristian conduct. It’s not spelled out. It simply 
says that his conduct is unbecoming a Christian and it gives the 
name of the person and that’s it. That person then is welcome to 
attend any of our meetings in the congregation, which is open to 
the public any time. We do not seek out his fellowship and association 
in any way, shape, or form. He’s not recognized in the congregation 
even if he should raise his hand. This is where we’re carrying out 
“remove the wicked man from among yourselves.” 
We realize from the Bible that reinstatement back into the congre¬ 
gation is based not on the amount of time that’s elapsed and not 
on the gravity of the sin, but on the repentance of the individual. 
So if the person can convince the body of elders that he’s truly 
and sincerely repentant through his actions and through what he 
says, he can be reinstated. Some have been reinstated in a month 
or two. 
Everyone is treated the same and the elders, when they meet 
with individuals, they try to put themselves in that person’s shoes. 
And they try to extend every avenue of mercy that they can. And 
you can believe when a person is disfellowshipped out of Jehovah’s 
Witnesses organization that that person absolutely didn’t want to 
stay in. That’s about what it amounts to. 
If you evaded your taxes and were caught by the law and were 
punished for it, certainly the congregation would raise a question 
about it if you continued it and weren’t repentant. If you are caught

breaking any of Caesar’s laws that did not conflict with God’s laws, 
the congregation would certainly want to talk to you. Why? Because 
we’re commanded to keep Caesar’s law. If you continually broke 
the speeding laws and received ticket after ticket you’d not be setting 
a good example. But the whole idea is that Jehovah’s Witnesses 
have one of the cleanest organizations in the world; I mean morally 
and physically clean. The Bible says that the elders are charged 
with the responsibility to keep it that way. So when a person appears 
to challenge the cleanness then they have to be removed. 
ruth: The opportunity to remain is there even after a person has 
committed sin. When they show a hard attitude that is unresponsive 
to what God wants them to do, then they’re put out. And rightfully 
so. We expect to be. We know that we will be. It’s a deterrent to 
sin. 
How do Jehovah’s Witnesses feel about the use of tobacco and alcohol? 
ernest: Our basic reason for not smoking is not for health reasons, 
because the surgeon general said it is dangerous, but because the 
Bible said that we’re supposed to present our bodies as clean and 
acceptable sacrifices. And it’s an unclean habit. How can you present 
an acceptable sacrifice to God if you’ve got a diseased body? It’s 
really, we feel, tantamount to suicide; it’s slow suicide, isn’t it? 
ruth: . . . you’re injuring something precious that God has given 
you. 
ernest: Smoking has always been completely out of vogue among 
Jehovah’s Witnesses. It was never a disfellowshipping offense up 
until about ten years ago. As the Society researched the derivations

day morning. 
of tobacco and smoking they found it to be associated with spiritism. 
The Greek word “pharmacea” has to do with drugs. Of course, 
now we use drugs in a medicinal way, out of a drug store, but 
originally these drugs were used by the priests in pagan ceremony 
and worship; And, of course, tobacco is a drug. There’s no question 
about that. And it has a tremendous effect on the body. In fact, 
some have said that tobacco’s even worse than some of these hard 
drugs to break the habit. 
Jehovah’s Witnesses may drink in moderation. It’s a matter of 
personal choice, but they don’t get drunk. Drunkenness is what the 
Bible condemns, not drinking. Jesus’ first miracle was to turn water 
into wine. 
Jehovah’s Witnesses, by not accepting a lot of these accepted 
things—like drunkenness, immorality, use of tobacco, and so forth— 
are actually protected. Jehovah’s Witnesses are not known to be 
dying from lung cancer. Because they don’t smoke. They don’t die 
of cirrhosis of the liver. They don’t have venereal diseases. So we 
have a tremendous protection by staying within the confines of this 
organization and associating with people who think like us. So, this 
is why we encourage close association with ones that think like we 
do. This is why we have such a brotherhood. 
Do Jehovah’s Witnesses encourage higher education ? 
ernest: We try to eliminate education that will not enhance our 
worship with our Creator. We encourage a full high school educa¬ 
tion. We do not encourage, in all cases, a higher education past 
that. The main reason is that if a person applies himself in hierh

school, he should be able to learn to read and write well without 
any problem. Additionally, we encourage a specialized education 
that Jehovah’s Witnesses provide. We probably have five to seven 
different types of schools that we operate now. We have no seminary. 
If you recall, there are scriptures where Jesus—what was it they 
said about Him?—they said that He didn’t study in the schools. 
That was recorded at John 7:15. We find that in some colleges 
there’s considerable atheistic-type curriculum that a person is ex¬ 
posed to—evolutionary and atheistic. And, we feel our children don’t 
need that. 
ruth: They need the basic training in learning to make a living 
and they need training in learning to be a disciple of Jesus; these 
are the two things in life they have to learn. So, whatever they need, 
technically, to do this is all the education we feel they need. They 
need a lot of education in spiritual warfare. 
What are those six or seven schools that you talked about? 
ernest: We have the continuing theocratic school within every con¬ 
gregation, of which anyone can join up. There are very few require¬ 
ments. Then, from time to time, they send instructors out from 
Brooklyn for schools where only elders are picked to attend. I went 
to one of these schools for two weeks and it was two weeks of solid 
instruction. Nothing new, nothing startling is brought up, simply 
a review of the basic Bible truths that elders need to know. Then 
we have a school for a group that we call pioneers. These are the 
ones who—say, for example, Ruth—found that she didn’t have to 
work full time and could devote ninety hours a month to knocking 
on people’s doors, to declaring the good news. This is a requirement 
to be what we call a pioneer. In other words, he’s basically spending 
his full time in the work and in strictly talking to people about the 
Bible. Then these have a special school. Out of that group certain 
ones are selected with the ability and the availability to go to other 
areas, like Rabun County was years ago when there were no Wit¬ 
nesses here, to serve as special pioneers. These go to a school. 
Then out of that group, they invite some from the pioneer group 
in general to what we call a Gilead School, which is held in New 
York. That is with the view to sending them overseas on missionary 
assignments. And they are strictly full time. These are the ones 
that go and live in branch homes or missionary homes in various 
countries and work as missionaries generally. All of these schools 
we’re talking about are above and beyond the five hours of instruc¬ 
tion that we all receive every week.

JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES 
ruth: You could stay right here at home as a Witness and get a 
very good education in the Bible. You don’t have to go anywhere. 
ernest: We’re encouraged to spend time in personal study before 
each meeting to know what’s going on. And then the elders take 
the time they need to spend in preparing lectures, talks, discussions 
and, I’m telling you, in the life of a Witness, most Witnesses, there’s 
not enough time in the day for them is what it amounts to. 
ruth: I can say that I believe truthfully that the knowledge a Witness 
has depends upon the Witness himself, how well he applies himself, 
because the education is there for him and the help is there for 
all of them. They have all the help they need to be just as good 
as they want to be. And this is locally and everywhere else and I 
believe that they are the best educated people, as a group religiously 
in the world. 
How do you feel about faith healing? 
ernest: We don’t practice any form of faith healing. We feel that 
it was a power that God gave to his son, Jesus, and Jesus gave 
that power to his twelve other apostles and a few other people, 
and we feel that when those people died that power left the earthly 
scene. This what the Bible says at 1 Corinthians 13:8-11. In order 
for the Christian church to get established, it needed something 
to show them that this was really from God. And so they had these 
acts of what Jesus did, like resurrecting people, healing people, 
speaking in tongues, which amounted to no more than speaking 
in a different language. So, it served to establish the church in the 
doubters’ minds. And so, what happened when Jesus would heal 
somebody? It would go like wildfire, wouldn’t it? They’d come flock¬ 
ing by the hundreds and thousands to him. So it served a purpose. 
Because Jesus—how long did he preach? Three and a half years. 
And yet look what he did in three and a half years. Look what it’s 
still doing today! He’s still the most popular religious figure on 
earth, isn’t he? 
ruth: But it was, as Paul explained, at 1 Corinthians 13:13, that 
these gifts, being able to do these things, would pass away and 
the Christian church would be identified by three other things— 
love, faith, and charity and the greatest of these is love. 
So you don’t believe in any kind of healing? 
ernest: We will accept most any kind of medical treatment for heal¬ 
ing with the exception that we don’t take blood transfusions. We

don’t take them because of a scriptural viewpoint and yet we find 
a tremendous amount of support in the hazards of taking blood— 
hepatitis, for instance, and venereal diseases have been transmitted 
that way. And the post-operative recovery of a person taking blood 
can take much longer. But the Biblical view is our real reason, not 
the medical view. The Bible says at Acts 15:28,29—“abstain from 
blood.” This was necessary for Christ’s followers. 
Also the Israelite law said that when you killed an animal, you 
had to drain him; you couldn’t eat the blood. Remember that? That 
was the law. There was no question about it. If they found an animal 
that had been strangled they weren’t allowed to eat it because the 
blood hadn’t been drained. Anyway. People say, “Well, you’re not 
feeding on it, you’re putting it into your veins, but, really, that’s 
just a way of bypassing the stomach—it goes into the stomach. In 
fact, what’s it called? It’s called intravenous feeding. If your doctor 
told you to abstain from alcohol, that you were going to die if you 
kept drinking for some reason or other, would you go and start 
injecting it into your veins and say, “Well, Doc, I’m not drinking 
it.” No. You see. It’s the same idea. 
Remember that one thing that I said one of the talks was on? 
“Should Life Be Saved At Any Cost?” Life, apparently, according 
to the Creator, shouldn’t be saved at any cost. Because if you have 
to break a law of God to save a life, then it shouldn’t be saved. 
ruth: And, we’re willing to die for that. 
ernest: Yes. So, if we’re on an operating table and the doctor says, 
“You are going to die if you don’t get blood,” while we respect 
his opinion as a doctor, we still ask that our rights as individuals 
be obeyed and that we not be given blood. We’ll take the conse¬ 
quence; we’re prepared. Here’s the thing about it. We feel that if 
we go ahead and take that blood, there’s a good chance we could 
die anyway. There’s no assurance, is there? What about your con¬ 
science? If you go ahead and take that blood and die, how might 
God view you? If it really is against the law of God? Whereas, if 
you don’t take the blood and go ahead and die, at least you have 
a better chance for a resurrection. It’s the long run we look at, 
not just the immediate future. 
The Bible says the life is in the blood. Recall, they never ate 
meat before the flood; they were never allowed to eat meat. Do 
you recall what the prohibition was after the flood? He said, “you 
can eat all the meat you want,” he says, “but don’t touch the blood.” 
Now, that wasn’t just a Mosaic law, that was the way it was before 
the law of Moses.

Clark’s father, Ernest A. 
Clark, shows a group of 
Witnesses preparing to

of the Bible using pho¬ 
tographs and recorded 
messages. 
ruth: There’s another point, too. Have you ever thought that God, 
who made the body, knows what’s best for it? In Acts 15:29, for 
instance, it says we’re to abstain from blood and it adds a couple 
of words that might interest you, “it adds good health to you.” 
Could it not be that God, in His providing these things in the Bible 
for us, is actually protecting our health? We view it even today, 
that He is. 
Listen to what God told Noah, at Genesis 9:3,4. He says, “Every 
moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. As is the 
case of green vegetation, I do give it all to you. Only flesh, with 
its soul, it’s blood you must not eat.” Notice how the word soul is 
used here? It’s the life of a person. That is the representation of 
life. It’s been called the “river of life.” So, God holds blood sacred. 
Remember, it was the blood of Christ, wasn’t it, that was so sacred 
there at the altar. And so this is why we feel that if He told them 
not to eat animal blood, how much more so human blood? 
Do you believe in foot washing? 
ernest: We don’t have the practice of foot washing at all. Jesus 
did do it, obviously, as a sign of humility, true humility. The thing 
about it, when Christ did it, He wasn’t trying to put on a show. 
When He washed the feet of the disciples, it was just the custom 
in those days. They’d come in, it was all sandy, they wore sandals 
in those days, and it was their custom that somebody’d get the wash- 
pan out. They were hot and dusty, so they’d all pull their sandals 
off and somebody’d wash their feet. Well, this time when they met,

nobody offered to do it and there was a need. Jesus just went ahead 
and did it; it wasn’t a show of piety on his part. 
Let’s try to look at it like the Lord’s Prayer. Some people reiterate 
the Lord’s Prayer word for word every day of their life. We look 
at it more as a model prayer. We don’t repeat those same words, 
but the basic ideas. And this is the idea about washing one’s feet. 
' Piety can be shown in so many different ways, you know. Jesus, 
He only did it once in the Bible that I know of, in three and a 
half years of His ministry. So it wasn’t a monthly practice, or a 
yearly practice; there’s no account made of it. 
How do Jehovah’s Witnesses feel about the scriptures Mark i6:iy and 18: 
“And these signs shall follow them that believe; in My name shall they cast 
out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; 
and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay 
hands on the sick, and they shall recover ”? 
ernest: All right, let me read to you here [he reads from the Watch- 
tower] “ ‘A zealous member was bitten by a rattlesnake Sunday night 
during a snake handling ceremony at a rural church and later died,’ 
so reported the New York Times. Only four days earlier the Times 
told of a woman dying after being bitten twice by a rattlesnake, 
September 16th, at the Jesus Pentecostal Church. ‘Snake Handling 
Sects Survives in Appalachians,’ quoted the Times feature. It showed 
pictures of snake handling done by members of the Holiness Church 
of God in Jesus’name. . . Why do these people make snake handling 
a part of their worship? Because in their authorized versions of 
the Bible, Mark 16:17 and 18,” which you just read, reads, “And 
these signs shall follow them that believe . . .’’Is that really what 
the inspired Bible teaches? An experience of the Apostle Paul might 
seem to indicate this. When he was shipwrecked on the island of 
Malta, a viper fastened itself on his hand as he was gathering kindling 
wood. When nothing happened to him, the natives began saying 
that he was God. But did Paul go out of his way to collect poisonous 
snakes in order to handle them? No. Nor do we read anywhere in 
the Greek Scriptures (that’s the same as the New Testament), where 
any of Christ’s followers did so. So what purpose is served, it may 
well be asked. What purpose does religious snake handling serve? 
“All the miraculous gifts that God bestowed upon Christ’s early 
disciples served very practical purposes.” So, really, we’re getting 
into all these things. “Curing sick people, raising dead persons, 
making lepers clean, dispelling demons. Even the gifts of tongues. 
On the Day of Pentecost, this gift of speaking in tongues enabled

Jews coming from more than a dozen different lands to hear the 
magnificent things of God in their own language. Later it was to 
be used for the edification of the Christian congregation. What 
they’re saying here is when people speak in tongues today it’s jibber- 
ish. At Pentecost, when the disciples got up and started preaching 
to the crowds, they were able to speak in the tongues of others, 
ones that were there so they could understand. That was the gift. 
But today, when they’re speaking in tongues, it’s not just in a foreign 
language. It’s an unknown language. 
The Apostle Paul stressed that no one should speak in a strange 
tongue unless an interpreter is present so that everyone could benefit 
from it. That scripture is First Corinthians 14:28: “What is to be 
done then, brothers, when you come together? One has a psalm, 
another a teaching, another a revelation, another a tongue, another 
an interpretation, but all things take place for upbuilding.” Again, 
a preacher talks in an unknown tongue, is it going to be upbuilding 
to anyone in the audience? It wouldn’t seem like it, would it? You 
don’t even know what he’s saying. 
It goes on. [He continues to read.] “There are other matters to 
consider. If the words ... at Mark 16:17,18, about handling snakes 
and not being harmed authorized Christians to do so, what about 
the other things mentioned in those verses? Should not Christian 
followers also be able to drink poison and not die? And what about

their being able to cure people merely by the laying hands on them?” 
It says, “to what conclusions do all these questions lead? There 
must be a mistake somewhere. In fact, that’s what nearly all modem 
Bible scholars have concluded.” And this may be a revelation to 
you, namely that these words—and not only these words, but all 
of what appears in Mark 16:9-20—were not written by Mark, but 
were added by a later hand. [Reading again] “On what grounds 
do scholars so conclude? On both external and internal evidence.” 
It says, first of all, there is the telling fact that the oldest and most 
highly regarded Bible manuscripts, the Vatican 1209, do not contain 
this section. Now there’s something to that. Those verses are not 
in the oldest manuscripts we can find. What does that say? That 
they were added later, possibly. “There are also a number of ancient 
manuscripts that contain a short ending of about one verse beyond 
8. Other manuscripts contain both conclusions.” So, some manu¬ 
scripts end with verse 8, others have a short ending, others have 
a long ending and some even give both endings. “In addition to 
all this testimony of the Greek manuscripts, all of which combines 
to cast doubt on Mark’s having written anything beyond verse 8, 
there are a number of the oldest versions or translations that do 
not contain the verse in question. 
“What if all this evidence were true that this was never even part 
of Mark’s writing? Doesn’t that lend even further credence to that 
fact that it’s not for Christians to do?” Let’s face it, the Bible you’ve 
got in your hand, that was printed in 1611 by the authority of King 
James of England. That was some sixteen hundred years since Christ 
and the apostles were on earth, wasn’t it—fifteen hundred and some 
odd years, we should say. All right, in those fifteen hundred years, 
do you think that’s the same Bible that Christ used? What do you 
think? That Bible, just like this one and every other one that we’ve 
got, is a translation of a translation. And I’m not trying to discredit 
the Bible in any way, but here’s what we’ve the advantage of, since 
1947. Have you ever heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls? Do you know 
what that’s done for Bible scholars? It’s been absolutely amazing. 
Recently they’ve found some they think are even older. 
Let me read you Benjamin Wilson’s comment on the King James 
Version of the Bible. Benjamin Wilson was not one of Jehovah’s 
Witnesses. This is what he stated: “In the year 1604, forty-seven 
persons learned in the languages were appointed to revise the trans¬ 
lation then in use.” So you see, they already had a translation; they 
were just going to revise it. “They were ordered to use the Bishop’s 
Bible as a basis for the new version and to alter it as little as the 
original would allow, but if the prior translations of Tyndale, Cover-

Watchtower study. 
dale, Matthew, Cramer, Woodchurch, and the Geneva editions 
agreed better with the text, to adopt the same.” They were saying 
the one that agreed more, use it. [He continues reading.] “This 
translation was perhaps the best that could be made at the time 
and if it had not been published by Kingly authority, it would not 
now be venerated by English and American Protestants as though 
it had come direct from God.” It’s a translation just like everything 
else we have—subject to errors. 
This is what Wilson goes on to say: “It,” talking about the King 
James, “has been convicted of containing over twenty thousand er¬ 
rors. Nearly seven hundred Greek manuscripts are now known and 
some of them are very ancient, whereas the translators of the com¬ 
mon version of the King James had the advantage of only eight 
manuscripts, none of which were any earlier than the tenth century.” 
This was written in ’42 before the Dead Sea Scrolls were even found. 
So what he’s saying is they only had eight basic manuscripts to 
make the King James from. They have found manuscripts now dated 
back before Christ was ever on the earth. When they read, they 
find that the King James had verses 9-20 in Mark that wasn’t in 
those. So you see how the human tendency is, that once you’ve 
got something, how’re you going to admit to yourself that it really 
isn’t what it should’ve been? A man who would simply say, “Well, 
it’s in my King James,” and not consider the evidence that this 
scripture was probably spurious and added later—if that’s the case, 
if you blind yourself to it, it can affect your worship. Because what

if God didn’t want Christians to be handling snakes? Is that really 
what Christianity is all about, handling snakes and drinking poison? 
It doesn’t appear like it, does it? 
Are there any major doctrinal differences between Jehovah's Witnesses and 
other religions ? 
ernest: Really, I’ll tell you, there are very few doctrines, basically, 
that Jehovah’s Witnesses agree with the majority of other religions 
on. And we like to point out the reasons. Let’s consider a few of 
the teachings, and you will see some of the differences. Well, [he 
reads] hardly anyone would disagree with the first one. The first 
one is, “The Bible is God’s word and is truth.” The second one 
is, “The Bible is more reliable than tradition.” Now the third one 
is, “God’s name is Jehovah.” I’ve noticed some of the ministers 
on the local radio using it occasionally. You’ll find among Jehovah’s 
Witnesses, if you ever come to the Kingdom Hall, it’s used as often 
as the word “God,” or maybe even more often. One of the things 
we feel is a mistake among most of the churches of Christendom 
is that they don’t really understand what the name means and the 
importance of it. There’re several scriptures in the Bible that show 
that really a Christian’s salvation is dependent on knowing the name 
of God. You ask the average person, “What’s our Creator’s name?” 
and he says, “God” or “Jesus.” Our contention is that the word 
Jehovah is a name, where the word God is a title or position. 
First Corinthians 8:5,6—what does it say? “There are many Gods 
and many Lords, but to us there is one God and one Lord, Jesus 
Christ.” 
ruth: And we think we need to differentiate between the two and 
to set Jehovah’s name higher than all the others. 
ernest: This is one of the commissions Jehovah’s Witnesses take 
to heart, take literally. They feel that the glorification or the sanctifi¬ 
cation or the honoring of the name of their Creator is absolutely 
number one. This isn’t saying that they do it perfectly and a hundred 
percent. They try. They’re imperfect just like the Baptists, like the 
Catholics. They try, you know, in their lives. 
ruth: The word “Jesus” means “Jehovah Saves.” 
ernest: It means Jehovah is salvation. You know, any word in the 
Bible that you ever see that ends with “jah”? That’s a shortened 
form of Jehovah. Have you ever heard the word at Christmastime, 
“Hallelujah”? It means “praise Jehovah.” How many people sing 
that and don’t know what it means? We’re trying to get people to 
know the meaning. 

============================================================
PAGE 165
============================================================

PLATE 32 Watchtowers. 
ruth: Our point on it is, many people not knowing Jehovah’s name 
and not knowing the importance of Jehovah are actually rendering 
worship that belongs to Jehovah to Christ. 
ernest: In the Bible, in Exodus, the third chapter, it says, “And 
God said unto Moses, ‘I am that I am,’ ” and that’s the literal meaning 
of the letters JHVH. When the Hebrew text was received from what¬ 
ever manuscripts that were available, all the scholars of the world 
had to work with was these four letters, JHVH. Those are all conso¬ 
nants and no vowels, and scholars changed it into readable language. 
One of the major differences between Jehovah’s Witnesses and 
other Christians is what the ultimate destiny of the God-fearing 
person is. To the Baptist, there are two destinies to the average 
person . . . 
ruth: Heaven and hell . . . 
ernest: You see, this is probably one of the biggest disagreements 
that people have with us when we go to them—we don’t believe 
that we have an immortal soul. You see, there’s no such word as 
immortal soul in the Bible. Did you know that? Yet you hear it 
constantly, don’t you? The immortal soul? You’ve heard that term? 
The two words are not found in conjunction in the Bible. You see, 
you have to believe that a person’s soul is immortal in order to 

============================================================

World Translation of the 
Holy Scriptures. 
believe in hell fire. Because what good would it be for God to send 
you to hell fire if you’re truly dead and don’t know anything? 
Here’re some basic reasons why we believe this. God saw fit to 
create man. The Bible says He created us in His image, didn’t He? 
All right, remember how the first man was made? This will give 
us a clue as to what we are and where we’re going when we die. 
Let me read it to you. It says, “And Jehovah God proceeded to 
form the man out of the dust of the ground and blew into his nostrils 
the breath of life.” And it says, “And the man came to be a living 
soul.” Now there really is the basis of the whole thing. According 
to that formula—He’s telling us how He made man—There are two 
basic ingredients, the dust of the ground and the breath of life. 
Now when He combines those two, what did He say He made? 
Man became a what? 
ruth: Living soul. 
ernest: Did you catch that? But do you know what ninety-nine per¬ 
cent of the people read into that? God gave him a soul. Now is 
there a difference or not? If my wife said, “I’m going to go make 
a cake,” she doesn’t go get the flour and the sugar and all the 
ingredients that goes into a cake, she doesn’t put it all together 
and then put a cake into it, does she? It’s simply a result of the 
combining of those things. In other words, after you’ve combined 
all of these things and put it in the oven, you have a completed 
cake. What happens if a person dies out in the desert? Their body 
goes right back into the atoms and molecules of the ground. So 
what is it then about man ... it says here, it says that “he became

165 
a living soul” as a result of God’s breathing His breath into him. 
Now would it shock you for me to tell you that animals are souls 
too? Genesis 1:20 and Numbers 31:28 says that they are. Ruth was 
taught for forty years that man has a soul instead of being a soul. 
We believe that we are the soul, as long as we are living. As long 
as we have the breath of life. We honestly believe that when humans 
die that they simply are out of existence. NOWHERE. The only 
chance a person has of living again is if you’re in God’s memory 
and He chooses to resurrect you at the Last Day as the Bible says. 
Hell, as far as Jehovah’s Witnesses are concerned, is simply wher¬ 
ever your grave is. It could be six feet under the ground, it could 
be in a fish’s belly if you died out at sea. That could be your hell, 
your grave. Remember when Jonah was thrown overboard? Let me 
read you from the King James Version, what he said and where 
he said he was. They found out that Jonah was the sinner among 
them causing the waves so they cast lots and threw him overboard. 
Jonah 2:2 says: “Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of 
the fish’s belly,” and notice where he’s at, now, he’s already been 
swallowed, “and said, ‘I cried by reason of my affliction unto the 
Lord, and He heard me. Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou 
heardest my voice.’ ” Now, do you you suppose he was feeling the 
flames of hell licking up around him inside that fish’s belly? That 
doesn’t really seem reasonable, does it? What do you think he 
thought was really going to happen to him? He thought he was 
going to die there, didn’t he? That’s what he thought was going 
to happen. 
Now, to Jehovah’s Witnesses, it seems more reasonable that hell 
is simply the abode of the dead, simply a state of non-existence, it 
makes more sense that this is where Jesus was for parts of three 
days. Then, what did God do at that time? He restored him back 
to life. 
Let me show you another scripture that will help to reinforce 
that. Ecclesiastes 9:4-10, and listen, it says, “For to him that is joined 
to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a 
dead lion. For the living know that they shall die; but the dead 
know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the 
memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and 
their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion 
forever in anything that is done under the sun.” Then dropping 
on down to verse 10, it says: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, 
do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, no knowledge, 
nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” Remember, the word 
“grave” means hell. Notice what it says? That the dead know nothing,

they don’t have any more wisdom, knowledge, work, or device. And 
so, if there is no consciousness, then there can be no fiery hell, 
can there? Otherwise, what would be its reason for being? And 
you recall when God made Adam and Eve there, back in Genesis? 
He put them in the Garden of Eden? Remember what He told them? 
“Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth.” And then he laid one 
restriction on them; remember what it was? 
THE TREE. . . . 
ernest: and what did He say would happen to them if they ate of 
the tree? 
THEY’D DIE. . . . 
ernest: You mean he didn’t tell them they’d go to hell and bum 
forever? See? That’s what people read into it. But we just can’t 
see it; it’s not there. He never promised them that “I’m going to 
bum you forever and ever because you ate from the tree.” In fact, 
what He actually said was: “dust you are, dust you will return to.” 
This is what Romans 6:7 says, “For he who has died has been 
acquitted from his sins.” So you see, once you die, you’ve paid 
the penalty for sin. That is it. It’s not burning forever and being 
tortured. So that’s why God then can resurrect them on the basis 
of Christ’s ransom, you see. Because he paid the price. 
Do Jehovah's Witnesses believe only 144,000 people will be chosen by God 
to be resurrected on the final day? 
ruth: Many are confused about the 144,000. This is because they 
have no concept of anything more than heaven and hell as man’s 
final destiny and they leave out the earth, which the Bible does 
not do. The Bible shows that the earth was to be inhabited and 
would be here forever. So they have no other place for their people 
to go. They say there either has to be a heaven or hell. And certainly 
there’s going to be more people alive than 144,000, so they get 
hung up and that number angers them because they think “there’s 
no chance for me if there’s only 144,000.” But actually there is a 
great number of people destined, more than anyone can number, 
destined to live on the earth. And by leaving out the earth, they 
leave out God’s hope for mankind. Earth will be brought back to 
the paradise condition that the Garden was in. 
ernest: In other words, you see what it’s getting back to? What 
God had originally purposed. For man and woman to live on the 
earth, to fill it with a righteous race of humans and to enjoy life 
forever. You see, the only time God ever told Adam and Eve that 
He’d terminate their life was if they disobeyed. So, what would be 
the alternative or the opposite of disobedience and death? Obedi-

ence and life, wouldn’t it? And he never promised them, “Well,” 
He says, “listen here, Adam, if you live and don’t eat of that tree 
for a thousand years then I’ll take you to heaven.” He never promised 
them that, either, did He? 
The reason for the Kingdom of Heaven was to rule over the earth. 
The Bible shows Christ made a covenant with them that they would 
be kings and priests over the earth. That’s recorded at Revelation 
5:10 and Luke 22:29. And think what a situation we’ve got here. 
Here’s a man who’d been on earth serving as our king and there’s 
the underkings and underpriests—a 144,000 people who have lived 
on the earth—what better representation would you and I want in 
heaven than somebody who’s already lived as a person? So then 
our feeling is that those 144,000 plus Christ are the only ones that’ve 
ever been promised heavenly life. 
You see, nobody really went to heaven before Jesus, did they? 
Think about that for a minute. Isn’t he the one that opened the 
way? 
ruth: The Bible says of man born of woman there is none greater 
than John the Baptist and that he that is least in the Kingdom of 
Heaven is greater than he is. This was said because John died before 
Jesus opened the way to heavenly life. I think it’s Hebrews 11:13 
that says that they never received the promise but still the promise 
is there for them, that they will be resurrected in God’s due time 
and brought back to live. 
ernest: In other words, this 144,000 that we’re talking about began 
to be numbered clear back when Jesus died. So, all of Christ’s apos-

ties were part of that—those who died after him. That’s why that 
scripture Ruth mentioned awhile ago says that the lowest angel in 
heaven is still greater than John the Baptist, because he never went 
to heaven. And can you think of anybody more worthy to go to 
heaven, if you were to list those worthy, than John the Baptist? 
He opened the way for Jesus, baptized Jesus, He never became 
part of the 144,000. So this 144,000 have been selected for the 
past two thousand years. 
Ruth’s husband died about two years ago. As much as she loved 
her husband, she doesn’t feel that he was sent to heaven. You don’t 
have that feeling at all, do you? 
ruth: No. 
ernest: So she realized and actually is comforted in knowing that 
he, no doubt, will, be resurrected back to the earthly scene. And 
frankly, most of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the 2.2 million that don’t pro¬ 
fess to be of the heavenly class, have a longing to live here on 
earth forever. We feel that this is what we were made for. 
So during the thousand-year reign of Christ’s Kingdom—which 
Jehovah’s Witnesses feel is not in the long distant future—the Bible 
shows that all the earth, literally billions, probably, will have the 
opportunity to be resurrected and then to be able to learn the Bible 
truths without having the sin of Adam being charged to them. It’s 
already been paid. 
What happens if the end of the world comes, say in my lifetime or your lifetime ? 
ruth: Jesus says that as the days of Noah were, so it will be at 
that time. That’s one good expression for this because it shows 
that many were taken alive into a whole new—well, the earth was 
here, but it was a cleansed earth at that time. So this was an example; 
that was a miniature picture that Jesus gave of how it will be at 
the end of the system of things. 
ernest: So this is where the majority of mankind will live. As we 
said, the billions who have died and maybe the millions who will 
live through the Battle of Armageddon and never have to die, they 
will form the nucleus for the new earth. And then those as they 
are resurrected back in an orderly fashion will be able to be taken 
care of, see? Housing, education and so forth will be available to 
them. Then, of course, the Bible shows that at the end of a thousand 
years man will be retested, but under completely different circum¬ 
stances. This time he’ll be tested just like Adam was; the perfect 
human with the influence of the devil. The devil will only be let 
loose right at the end of the thousand years. And he will accomplish 
some of his purpose. 

============================================================

JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES 169 
During the thousand-year reign in Revelation, the 20th chapter, 
notice what it says is going to happen here, it says, “I saw the dead, 
small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened, 
and another book was opened, which was the Book of Life; and 
the dead were judged out of those things which were written in 
the books, according to their works.” Then it says, notice? “And 
the sea gave up the dead which were in it.” Now think about that 
for a minute. Remember a while ago I said when you die, if you 
die out at sea, that could be your hell or your grave? 
ruth: So these people in hell are dead. That’s what the Bible says. 
ernest: But now if those people were condemned to eternal torment, 
have you ever heard of anybody ever getting out of hell? Is there 
a concept of that ever known? To my knowledge, I’ve heard them 
say . . . when you go to hell you’re there forever basically. But 
here it says, “death and hell delivered up.” Again, how can death 
deliver up something? Is it a tangible thing? It’s a state of being, 
isn’t it? It’s a condition, isn’t it? Then this is what we say hell is, 
or the grave, it’s a condition of the dead. And notice what it says 
here, “death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them; 
and they were judged every man according to their works. And 
death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.” And then it’s all 
cleared up in these words, it says, “This is the second death.” 
ruth: And this second death is God’s judgment. These people will 
be dead forever. 
ernest: So once they’ve been resurrected back, if they prove unwor¬ 
thy then for life, under the system where the devil isn’t there to 
influence them, where they no longer can say, “Well, I’m just a 
sinner like Adam,” then they will be removed from the earthly scene 
to never ever experience a resurrection. But, it simply says it’s the 
second death. And it used such terms here as “death and hell were 
cast into the lake of fire.” Well, how can you cast an intangible 
thing into a lake of fire? You can do it simply by removing death 
from the earth, can’t you? Removing the plague of death. 
ruth: That’s what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:26 that “death 
will be destroyed.” 
ernest: And in Revelation the 21st chapter, verse 4, it says, “God 
will wipe away all tears from their eyes; there will be no more death, 
neither sorrow nor crying nor pain be any more; the former things 
have passed away.” This is our hope for the future and what we 
feel will be the answer to the prayers of righteous ones everywhere.

The Methodists and their brand of religion were well accepted 
in the mountains. Church related activities of this denomination 
appealed to the people, as evidenced by the recollections of those 
who appear in this section: 
E. L. Adams, 100 years old and a Methodist preacher, remembers 
strong, spontaneous, and enthusiastic revivals. 
Julie McClure, 105, recalls the “protracted meeting” and old 
camps where “they had the best meetings in the world.” She adds 
that “back then when you got religion, you kept it; people lived 
right.” 
Conley Henry discusses “all day singings” and “dinner on the 
grounds.” 
Leonard Vissage, who joined the Methodists in 1914, remembers 
a footwashing at his church and other “wonderful, wonderful times.” 
E. C. Presley, a Baptist who turned Methodist when he married, 
talks of the time when those two denominations worked together 
and combined their services. 
In contrast to these warm reminiscences, several of those inter¬ 
viewed express concern over a perceived change in the attitudes 
and practices of Methodists and the religious in general. Conley 
Henry, for example, worries about the new, more liberal stands 
on open marriage, abortion, and women in church pulpits; Leonard 
Vissage, in a more general way, questions the dedication and convic-

tions of younger generations. These concerns are indeed real to 
many and will most certainly receive future consideration in not 
only Methodist circles but all denominations. 
In general, Methodist theology has been and will continue to be 
appealing to a great number of individuals. Those like E. L. Adams 
and Julie McClure are living examples of its impact on religious 
life in Appalachia. 
PAUL F. GILLESPIE 
E. L. ADAMS, Methodist 
E. L. Adams, a Methodist minister, is the second oldest person interviewed 
for this study. At 100 years of age, Reverend Adams remembers when the 
Methodist Church was composed of two major groups, the Northern Methodists 
and the Southern Methodists. Reverend Adams began his ministry around 
the year 1900 and traveled a country circuit to different Northern Methodist 
churches in the mountains. He recounted when the two branches of this faith 
combined and happily added that “the combination churches did a heap better 
work than they did when they were separated. ” 
While many Protestant individuals and groups are adamant that their partic¬ 
ular theology and beliefs represent the only true way, therefore ruling out 
any spirit of cooperation, there are others, including Reverend Adams, who 
have always believed that churches of different denominations should work 
together in their ministry and outreach. He, himself, preached in several different 
churches. He says, “It never made any difference to me whether I was in a 
Northern Methodist pulpit, a Southern Methodist pulpit, or a Baptist pulpit. 
I was just preaching to folks and I always had a good congregation. ” This 
short interview exemplifies this spirit of mutual cooperation as Reverend Adams 
discusses his ministry.

I was raised in a very religious home. My father was a preacher, 
and I grew up under the influence of the home. We had family 
prayer twice a day. I always went to Sunday school, and I joined 
the church when I was eight years old. I was baptized by immersion 
in a small fish pond [near] where I was raised. They’ve always used 
some pond or some stream. The church I joined was the Congrega¬ 
tional Methodist church. There is no difference in the Congrega¬ 
tional Methodists and the regular Methodists except the 
Congregationalists select their pastors, and the regular Methodists 
serve their pastors [to the churches] from the conference. I don’t 
remember any special experience that I had except I was leading

prayer and Sunday school and things like that by the time I was 
nine or ten years old. 
I had the idea I was going to be sent as a missionary. I finally 
made up my mind and decided that what the Lord wanted me to 
do would be [foreign mission work]. The impression I got [from 
God was], “You are right where I want you.” I was at Young Harris 
[Georgia] teaching and preaching at these country churches. I felt 
that the Lord wanted me to preach. I commenced preaching by 
the time I was twenty-one or twenty-two years old. 
I usually preached in the country churches under the pastor of 
the Young Harris church. I was the junior preacher. At the beginning, 
there were four Southern Methodist country churches and four 
Northern Methodist churches. Back during the Civil War, there were 
as many folks in this country that went to the Federal Army as went 
to the Confederate Army. When the war was over, more folks had 
been bushwhacked and killed in this country than had been killed 
in the army. You can understand what a division there would have 
been. So the two churches were separated. The Northern Methodists 
had one pastor that came here. Finally, when the Northern Method¬ 
ists became weak, and on the occasion when they didn’t have a 
pastor, I went and preached if they invited me to. Finally the North¬ 
ern Methodists appointed me over their country churches. It wasn’t 
long until the Northern Methodists were wanting to combine with 
the Southern Methodists, but I held them off until the conferences 
did the combining. We consolidated some of those Northern Meth¬ 
odists with the Southern Methodists, and some Southern Methodists 
with the Northern Methodists. The separated churches were then 
combined. The combination churches did a heap better work than 
they did when they were separated. It never made any difference 
to me whether I was in a Northern Methodist pulpit, a Southern 
Methodist pulpit, or a Baptist pulpit. I was just preaching to folks, 
and I always had a good congregation. 
I never made any difference or felt any difference between folks, 
regardless of their profession. In the churches where I preached, 
I had the Holiness that came in to help with the singing and praying. 
I will give you this illustration: I was running a revival meeting 
and a Holiness preacher and his wife came along. They tried to 
run a meeting in one of the Methodist churches on the head of 
Hightower where I was pastor. The folks didn’t want them in there. 
The regular organized churches didn’t give them much encourage¬ 
ment. They came on down to this other church [where I was running 
the revival], and they told me they’d like to attend my services if I 
didn’t object. I said I didn’t object to anybody. They were good

singers and I put them at the head of the singing and leading prayers 
and one thing and another; both he and his wife would pray publicly. 
So time ran along, and it came to the end of the second week [of 
revival]. I had about a dozen that had joined the church. About 
half of them wanted to be immersed and about half sprinkled; they 
had their choice. There was a pool in the creek right down past 
the church that all the denominations used. So I set [the time to 
baptize] at Sunday morning at nine o’clock for the ones to be im¬ 
mersed. 
There was a schoolhouse right close to the church. When I went 
down there to put on clothes that I didn’t mind getting wet, this 
Baptist preacher was in there changing his. He was going to baptize 
a woman that wanted to join the Baptist church. There had come 
up a squabble in the Baptist church as to whether she’d have to 
be re-immersed; I’d immersed her [before]. The leaders of the Bap¬ 
tist church had decided, according to the law of the Baptist church, 
she’d have to be re-immersed, and by a Baptist preacher. I wasn’t 
a Baptist preacher. Some of them had said if my baptism wasn’t 
good, then they didn’t know why. But they went according to the 
law and she had to be re-immersed. About a month before, he had 
set that [same] Sunday morning to baptize her in that pool beside 
our church where I was going to baptize. Well, this Baptist preacher

was in that schoolhouse changing his clothes. He began to apologize 
and said he hoped he wasn’t interfering with me. I said, “no,” that 
there was never any interference concerning worship, no matter 
who it is. 
Well, I had this Holiness preacher and his wife to sing, and the 
Baptist preacher and I went up together to the pool, and we arranged 
it this way: I was to go in first and he was to lead my four (I believe 
it was four) in to me to immerse them and lead them back. And 
when he came in with the fourth one, I’d go out and lead his one 
in [for him to baptize]. [While he was baptizing his,] I got over to 
the other end of the pool, and I thought I put my foot on a rock. 
I sort of put my weight on it to shove it down in the mud and it 
proved to be a mud turtle! I held him down there until we got 
through, and then we went to the schoolhouse [to change clothes]. 
I said to this Baptist preacher, “Brother Jones,” (I don’t remember 
what his name was) “did you notice anything unusual when you 
went in there?” 
He said, “No.” 
I told him about that mud turtle and he broke out in a big laugh. 
He said, “You certainly are getting things together. You got a Holi¬ 
ness preacher standing on the bank singing his heart out, and joining 
in with a Baptist and Methodist preacher at a baptizing. They were 
all there, but I had no idea there was a Hardshell Baptist around!” 
The attitude of one denomination toward another certainly has 
[changed]. The attitude of the Protestant church toward the Catho¬ 
lics certainly has changed [for the good]. My attitude is this: There 
is one God, one Bible, one Savior, one Holy Spirit, and God is 
the heavenly Father of everybody. 
The world is getting better. You see, there’s an attitude in all 
the different denominations; the leaders of the various divisions in 
the churches of the world today are nearer together than they used 
to be. I’ve set down over here in a Baptist church when a Baptist 
preacher would turn around toward the “amen” comer and make 
a statement that if you weren’t immersed and didn’t belong to the 
Baptist church, you didn’t have any chance to get to heaven. Now, 
that’s all quit. Of course, the denominations give the people the 
best chance to join what they want to and what they believe. You 
take the people of the world. The leaders of the main nations right 
now are getting together and settling their disputes. They’re setding 
by mutual understanding rather than by war. I’ve lived long enough 
to see a heap of changes.

JULIE McCLURE, Methodist 
Julie McClure, who we learned, about through an article by Barbara McRae 
in the Franklin (North Carolina) Press, has the distinction of being the 
oldest person we have interviewed for this publication. Mrs. McClure was 
bom October i, 1875, in a log cabin near Hayesville, North Carolina, the 
daughter of Matilda Johnson Coleman and George Coleman. Both of her 
grandfathers were immigrants to this country, one from Ireland and one from 
Scotland. 
At 105, Mrs. McClure possesses a great awareness and, even though she 
is hard of hearing and her eyesight is not what she would like it to be, we 
were intrigued that she could remember so much about her earlier experiences, 
particularly the ones of a religious nature. It seems that those were the most 
vivid and she attaches much significance to them. 
Mrs. McClure has lived in the mountains all of her life and has witnessed 
many traditions that have been on the decline or vanished altogether over 
the years. For example, her mother carded wool and wove material for clothing; 
her father tanned hides and made shoes. She emphatically pointed out that 
“he even made his own wooden pegs for those shoes. ” As true of many mountain 
families, they also made such things as soap, candles, and molasses. 
Julie McClure also remembers aspects of mountain religion that have nearly 
disappeared; she talks of old-time “protracted meetings” and the fact that 
the Sabbath Day was strictly and rigidly observed. She clearly remembers her 
conversion experiences and being baptized. Mrs. McClure admits to being a 
“proud Methodist” for just about all of her 105 years and it pleases us to 
have a person of her age and Christian experience included here.

I got religion on my own feeling. I went [to church] ever since 
I was big enough to know what going was. I can go right to the 
spot today where I got saved at a protracted meeting. We called 
it a protracted meeting back then. Old-times, you know. Old-fash¬ 
ioned times. That’s what I love. It was on the side of the road 
going home [that I got saved]. I was fourteen years old. I joined 
the church at that time, the old M. E. Methodist Church, and I’ve 
belonged to it ever since. Sure did. 
I was sprinkled twice. The first time I was sprinkled at home. I 
remember that, too. I was small. The preacher came by from the 
campground and stopped to speak with me and my little sister. 
Old preacher Campbell was his name. Gray-bearded. He was going 
back home from the camp meeting. My father came out and hung 
me up and spanked me for running [from the preacher]. Carried 
me under his arms and the preacher sprinkled me. Then when I 
got religion and went to join the church I was sprinkled again. They 
sprinkled me in the church. I was always a Methodist. 
It used to I’d never heard tell of [anything but Methodist]. It’s 
the truth. The old M. E. Methodist Church is the first church that 
I can remember and that’s been a right long time, you know. It’s 
been there ever since the world’s been standing, I reckon. I wouldn’t 
ever part from the Methodists. That’s right. I know all about it. 
I knew [the church] to have camp meetings [with] tents built 
around a big arbor. Back when I was nine years old, I went there. 
My father had a tent built there. Nothing bothered it but the Method¬ 
ists. The Methodists were the ones that run it. It had a big, long 
arbor and you had to go out there and hear preaching. The people 
would move there. Take their rations with them and move there 
and stay for six weeks and run that meeting. I remember all about 
it. I was about nine or ten years old then. I can remember back 
then better than I can now. 
Used to have the best meetings in the world. I’m sorry they tore 
the camp meeting up. I’ll tell you, those camp times were the best 
times you ever saw. People took their own rations down. They didn’t 
go and buy it; they raised it in the fields and gathered it up and 
took it there to feed the people at the campground. 
They had good [revivals] too. They had them in the daytime and 
of the night, too. Now they just have a little of the night. They’d 
work in the field until meeting time and then they’d go with just 
what they had on and have preaching at twelve o’clock [noon] and 
then they’d have meeting of a night.

Never saw but one woman in my life have the Holy Ghost in 
the Methodist church. She’d come to Sunday school every Sunday. 
She d dance and testify in Sunday school. She was Methodist and 
that s what she did every Sunday. She said she was sanctified. 
Back then when you got religion you kept it. People lived right. 
They wouldn’t grind coffee on Sunday. They wouldn’t chum on 
Sunday. They wouldn’t bake bread on Sunday. They sure did live 
straight. My mother raised two or three loaves of bread every Satur¬ 
day and it done ’til Monday. 
I was raised to go to church. I was raised in a religious home. I 
had four brothers and two sisters. My father stayed upstairs and 
in the night when he’d get ready to go to bed, he’d come downstairs 
and have prayer. I always went to Sunday school and meetings. I 
was raised religious. 
I can remember when my mother made my dresses to my ankles 
and I had to wear them there. She’d make my step-ins to come 
down, you know. And I didn’t think that I wanted to wear them 
down there long. When I’d get to school, I’d roll them up. I’d 
pull them [down] before I got back home. They’d make them nice, 
you know. They’d put trimming on them. I thought that was a little 
too tacky. I didn’t like it. 
[We never did play cards either.] Pshaw, no! I remember burning 
one deck they brought in my house after I was married. My mother 
would never have that thing in her house—a deck of cards. That’s 
the devil’s work. 
[People today] ain’t got what they used to have, I don’t believe. 
I feel that way. Times ain’t like they used to be. No, there ain’t 
nothing like it. I just feel the end of time ain’t far off. I believe 
that the Lord’s coming. I know we’re in the last days. The Bible’s 
about fulfilled. It’s already fulfilled.

CONLEY HENRY, Methodist 
We met Conley Henry quite by accident. On a hot and humid summer 
day while we were on a general search mission for religious material, we 
happened by old Double Springs Methodist Church. Its mere appearance sug¬ 
gested an interesting historical significance and we stopped at little stores and 
houses looking for some of its members. We were directed to the home of Conley 
Henry who welcomed us warmly amidst the noisy barking of dogs not yet 
convinced of our intent. After running a power cord out onto the cool porch 
from inside the house, the tape recorder was turned on and Mr. Henry began 
telling us about his church and his beliefs. As this interview will indicate, 
Mr. Henry was frank, open, and extremely straightforward. 
Bom August 13, 1909, in Jefferson, Georgia, he has since lived most of 
his life in the mountainous regions of Georgia and North and South Carolina. 
He joined the church in 1918 (which at that time was composed of both 
Methodist and Baptist members) and he has closely watched it and others 
develop since that time. There are many aspects and problems of our society 
that concern Mr. Henry, but through his testimony, it is indeed evident that 
he is honest in his beliefs and steadfast in his faith.

My wife and I both were bom in Georgia. I was bom in Jefferson 
right out of Gainesville. I’ve lived in and out of this country practi¬ 
cally all my life except from ’36 to ’42 when I worked with the 
National Park Service. Then in ’42, the war came on and, of course, 
we were all facing the draft. In ’42 I worked on the farm right 
here for about a year. In ’43 I went to work for the United States 
Forest Service [in Montana]. Later in ’43 I was drafted. I went into 
the army in January, ’44 and left a wife and two children, as many 
did. 
[I don't remember when I was first introduced to the Methodist 
Church.] So many years has happened since that. I was born in 
1909, you see, and [my conversion] was along in the 1920s. I joined 
the Greenstreet Methodist Church in Gainesville at the age, I dare¬ 
say, around twelve years. Both my sister and I became members. 
The pastor there was Reverend Mack Eakes. 
My wife’s people have been members of [Double Springs Method¬ 
ist Church] ever since there’s been a church out there. She was a 
Mongold. And from this book of the church [he holds up church 
record book], you’ll see [the name of] William Mongold. The church 
was established on September 9, 1858, as a union church. The deed 
was executed by Eliot M. Keith and Alexander Bryce, Sr. [In the 
deed] Lewis Moorehead, Ron Fretwell, and Gambel Brazeale [were 
named as trustees]. The lot contained ten acres, more or less, and 
it was deeded for the cause of religion. Up until the late 1940s, 
both the Baptist and the Methodist faiths worshipped at this church. 
Up until just late years, it was always known as Double Springs 
Methodist Church, not Double Springs United Methodist. We don’t 
call ourselves “united.” In fact, there’s still a legal question, which 
is open to controversy, as whether we actually have become the 
United Methodist Church or not, because we became United Meth¬ 
odist and we didn’t know it. 
They had some awful hot times out there at that church when it 
was a union church, and we’re still having some trying times yet. 
[The friction] wasn’t between the two denominations, it was between 
Baptists and Baptists and Methodists and Methodists. There was 
practically no friction between Baptists and Methodists. We’ve always 
figured that the friction that came about was a family friction rather 
than a denominational friction. 
In the late forties, the Baptists pulled out and built a church of 
their own. And just until very recently, in the last year, they called 
their church Double Springs Baptist Church. There was some other 
Double Springs Baptist churches on Oconee County [South Caro¬ 
lina] and they saw fit to change their name to Mountain Rest. Moun-

tain Rest Baptist Church. Now, the cemetery out there [Double 
Springs cemetery] is just as old as the church is. It’s a union cemetery. 
There’s people of all faiths buried out there. People that don’t be¬ 
long to a church at all. There’s Methodists and Baptists. 
It was [common then for Methodists and Baptists to worship to¬ 
gether], because that was the only church out here. People from 
Pine Mountain [Georgia] came and worshipped. In fact, Baylus Ni¬ 
cholson, whose name is listed right there, is a man from up at Pine 
Mountain. One of the Baylus Nicholsons (now there’s several Baylus 
Nicholsons, it was a common name among Nicholsons), this Baylus 
is the father of one of the beloved Rangers in Rabun County [Geor¬ 
gia]. I know you’ve heard of Forest Ranger Roscoe Nicholson. In 
fact, the Coleman River Wildlife area [has] a monument to Roscoe 
Nicholson [because] he was the first ranger on that district. Out 
there at that church in the early days, some slaves saw fit to stay 
with their white people when they were freed; in fact, that was the 
case with my wife’s mother. There was a slave that stayed with her 
and they always spoke of her—now, this word would be forbidden 
now—she was known as Nigger Mary, and Nigger Mary, no doubt, 
had worshipped out here at this very same little church. 
I can remember one expression that my mother [learned from] 
a particular old lady that was there [who was], no doubt, very, very 
devout. She said, “May the Spirit of the Lord descend on this congre¬ 
gation like fire going through the broomsage.” Now, you know what 
broomsage is, don’t you? Now, when fire goes through broomsage, 
it goes in a hurry, don’t it? 
They [used to get] quite emotional and shouted. They had another 
little expression that always brought a little bit of laughter to us. 
This particular individual, she was evidently shouting and she be¬ 
came so emotionally upset that she fainted. And you know how it 
was in the old days when anybody fainted, why, they all crowded 
around—-just a big crowd around ’em. So someone began to walk 
in and push ’em back and says, “Boys, stand back, stand back,” 
(and they called her Sal). Says, “Sal’s got to have air, God or no 
God!” So, you’ll agree with that, wouldn’t you? Now, those things 
have been handed down to me. As the saying goes, “The truth it 
may or may not be.” But the two things that I said, there’s nothing 
sacriligious about them if you take it seriously. There was a person 
there that fainted, and the fellows didn’t know much about first 
aid then. The man knew that she had to have air, and he began 
pushing them back ’cause “Sal’s got to have air, God or no God.” 
In the present Methodist church out there now—perhaps one of 
the failings of the church, I’d say, [is that] we haven’t had a revival

out there at that church in ten or fifteen years. We used to have 
them many years ago. My wife’s in there; she’ll sort of coach me a 
little on that. They had revivals and at times we’d have a Baptist 
minister for one revival, and then on another revival, we’d have a 
Methodist. That, you might say, is one of the failings of our church 
now. I was talking to an eighty-year-old citizen yesterday (his name’s 
mentioned on [the church record]—he’s a Vissage), and he said 
the last revival we’d had there was about ten or fifteen years ago. 
mrs. henry: Yes, I can [remember that]. We had a week of it and 
we’d have a morning and an evening service. Everybody’d get happy. 
mr. henry: Lots of times those revivals would be in August. Yeah, 
hottest time there was, and they’d have a morning session and an 
evening session. Some of the ones that attended those revivals, 
they’d call it “roast ’n ear religion.” 
mrs. henry: We didn’t have the camp meeting or the brush arbors. 
The Methodists and the Baptists out here did not have it. 
mr. henry: [We’d] have a protracted meeting and it would last two 
weeks. It was the custom then to invite the preachers home to dinner. 
They’d stay in the home while they were here. Now that was back 
in horse and buggy days. In fact, right across the road from that 
old church there used to be a hitchin’ rack. They’d tie their horse 
or their mule up to a swinging limb. That’s been in memory of 
my day. I can remember when they had the horses. People came 
out there and they had dinner on the grounds. They’d just spread 
the tablecloth down on the ground and put the food down on the 
ground; of course, we had ants, yellow jackets, and things like that 
to contend with just like we do now. Some of those old trees out 
there could tell you more about it than I could if they could talk. 
The first homecoming that I know of anything about was this 
hundredth homecoming August 10, 1958. The pastor then was Rev¬ 
erend Robert J. Howell. 
We’ve survived several storms in that church out there. Some 
have not been too pleasant. Along in 1958, they wanted to move 
that church—move the church from its present location over to High¬ 
way 28. A good many of the older members didn’t want to move 
and some of the younger day generation did. We took a vote on 
the thing. We thought we were outnumbered and apparently the 
good Lord took a hand in that. That took place somewhere around 
1958, because this man [Robert Howell] was the pastor of the church. 
Anyhow, we went to see the district superintendent, B. B. Black, 
who was down here in Anderson, South Carolina. He made us the 
commitment that they’d never make the proposal to move our church

again. It’s never come up again about moving that church anywhere. 
Singing was a popular thing; in fact, they would have an all day 
singing and then dinner on the ground. They’d come from Pine 
Mountain all up in there. The all day singing and dinner on the 
ground was quite common. They didn’t have any trouble then [in 
getting people to come sing]; in fact, I can remember when they 
used an organ out there. It hasn’t been but just the last thirty or 
forty years or longer that they had a piano. They always used an 
organ. All day singing and dinner on the ground . . . that was the 
order of the day. And Baptists, Methodists, and the ones that belong 
to the big church—meaning the ones that didn’t belong to any church 
whatsoever [all came together]. 
mrs. henry: They would have groups, quartets, and the congrega¬ 
tion. 
mr. henry: Along in the year they [had singing]. We had a pastor 
here just before the one we have now and he told a little innocent 
incident. He said that they had a quartet, and he said they had a 
quartet of six. 
He told another little interesting thing that happened in Pickens 
County Court. Now this was in Pickens County, South Carolina and 
the pastor’s name was Reverend Edgar Grant and he’ll verify this 
very story. He said that this particular court, why, as they’d call 
their name to see whether or not they were present at the court 
procedures, why [the judge’d say], “When we call your name, we 
want you to answer with a verse of scripture.” So this one would 
answer with one verse and the other with another and they kind 
of began to run out of shorter verses. They called on one and he 
recited as his verse, “Jesus wept.” You know, that’s the shortest 
verse in the Bible. Called on this next man and he’d just about 
run out of verses. He made like he didn’t know too much about 
the verses in the Bible, and this [first] man said, “Jesus wept,” so 
the next man answered, he said, “He sure did.” 
Now we’ve had some pretty rough characters around that church; 
in fact, there has been one of the doors that has been replaced. 
On one of the original doors out there, there was about a .32 caliber 
bullet hole. I won’t make any statement whatsoever about who shot 
through the church door. I don’t know who did it; all I know is 
hear-say, and that don’t go. Now, why they did it ... it might have 
been because he was happy . . . riding a horse or a mule . . . and 
he decided he’d just shoot at something. [Maybe] he didn’t intention¬ 
ally intend to shoot at the church, but the hole was in the door 
for anyone to see and was for many days. It is not in the present

184 
doors. It happened sometime when there was no worship services 
at the church. Part of the [church] history that we’re not proud 
of ... a lot of the people that worshipped out there, they made 
whiskey—or said they did. 
mrs. henry: [They’d have church trials.] Church ’em. 
mr. henry: Church ’em. That’s the term they called it. 
mrs. henry: They’ve done that out here in this union church—the 
Baptists have. 
mr. henry: I don’t reckon we’ve ever had any Divine healing out 
there or snake handling. There was none of that speaking in tongues. 
I don’t know how they did about taking communion. You see, 
the old Methodists believed in open communion and the Baptists, 
you might say, have closed communion. But if there was ever any 
friction between the matter of taking communion between the Bap¬ 
tists and the Methodists as long as there was a union church, I 
never did hear of it. I never heard of anyone being refused commu¬ 
nion in this old Methodist church. That’s one point of difference 
now between the Baptists and the Methodists. Of course, the immer¬ 
sion is one thing and sprinkling another. Another [difference] is 
exhortation. The Methodists don’t believe in exhorting anyone to 
join the church; they apparently didn’t. 
But, of course, now there’s so many things at the Methodist church 
that I don’t agree with and among them is the open marriage, the 
stand on abortion, and the matter of the Panama Canal—turn it 
over to the Panamanians. I was in Panama in World War II. And 
another thing is segregation. The old Southern Methodist Church, 
which is the only segregation church that I know of, best represents 
my views on the church. In fact, my father who died in Georgia 
and was buried up here at Rabun Gap cemetery, told me just as a 
child, he felt like one of the biggest mistakes the Methodist church 
ever made was when they united with the Northern Methodist 
Church. It had to have been somewhere around ’36 to ’42. I think 
it was somewhere in ’39. Well, ’39 was rough times in this country. 
It was rough times. 
The present United Methodist is, in my opinion, on the wrong 
track. Another thing is gun control. I am not a racist. I am not a 
racist. I’m saying that twice. If you allow me to select my Black 
associates and friends, I may be more familiar with them than just 
the run of the mill Black people. Yeah, if you can select, but to 
have the Federal government to say I’ve got to take them in my 
church or listen to them worship, I think they’re exceeding the 
boundaries of reason.

I’ve always considered myself like the book written many years 
ago about a man without a country, and I feel like maybe in this, 
I’m a man without a church because so many of these new varieties 
of the United Methodist Church I don’t go along with. As to why 
I was a member of the old Methodist church, I believe in open 
communion. I believe that if a man wants to be sprinkled, sprinkle 
him. If he wants to be baptized, baptize him. If he wants either or 
both, that’s all right. I am . . . let’s see ... let me count how 
many generations . . . my great-grandfather, my grandfather, my 
father . . . I’m a fourth-generation Methodist. That’s right, and my 
son’s fifth, but we can’t go along with this United Methodist. Now, 
we may have to because we haven’t another way to go. 
Some of these more liberal preachers have shifted from the regular 
Apostles’ Creed that we repeat in the morning worship, the altar 
worship. They’ve been using another creed, and we’ve always been 
reared to use the Apostles’ Creed. And that’s one of the differences 
in the present day United Methodist Church and the old church 
that we knew. Here’s the old acclamation of faith also known as 
the Apostles’ Creed: “I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker 
of heaven and earth and Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who 
was conceived by the Holy Spirit, bom of the Virgin Mary, suffered 
under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried, the third day 
arose from the dead, ascended to heaven and sitteth at the right 
hand of God the Father Almighty and thence He shall come to 
judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy 
Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, 
the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting.” Now, the 
new United Methodist Church has substituted another creed. That’s 
another thing we don’t understand—why the new United Methodist 
Church does not continue to use the old Apostles’ Creed. Some 
of them don’t recognize the Virgin Mary. 
Another thing [is] they do not adhere to the Bible. The United 
Methodist Church does not adhere to the King James Version as 
strict as the old Southern Methodist Church does. That’s one of 
the basic differences in the two set-ups. Another thing that the Meth¬ 
odist Church is lax on now—and it just makes my blood boil every 
time I hear it—and that’s homosexuality. Yes siree. And the question 
of homosexuality is, and you refer to the Bible, it’s recognized as 
a sin. Very clearly and there’s no compromise on it whatsoever if 
you adhere to the wording of the Bible, which any one of us can 
understand—which is as simple as a simple directional sign on the 
highway—we can understand what the Bible stand is on homosexual-

ity; it condemns it as sin. But, yet the United Methodist Church is 
weak on it. It takes a weak-kneed stand on it. And I dare say, if 
some of the poor souls that’s buried out here in this Double Springs 
cemetery knew that the stand was being taken, they’d roll over in 
their graves; in fact, the liberal stand is one of the biggest objections 
that I have to the United Methodist Church now. Maybe we can 
tolerate the segregation or the integration. We can tolerate the inte¬ 
gration, because we’ve got the same Lord. We have the same Maker 
and we’re trying to go to the same place. We can tolerate that. 
But asking us to tolerate open marriage, abortion, homosexuality 
is just more than I can stomach. Too liberal . . . absolutely too 
liberal. And may I add women preaching in church pulpits . . . King 
James Version plainly forbids such. 
In some instances [people] have [gotten away from the church]. 
[Our church is] moderately strong, but few in numbers compared 
to Baptist faith. Double Springs Methodists are allergic to night 
air and revivals.

LEONARD VISSAGE, Methodist 
After our visit and interview with Conley Henry, he suggested we meet 
and talk to one of his friends, and “old-time ” Methodist, Leonard Vissage. 
When talking about religion today, Mr. Vissage’s general tone is one of 
caution and concern. Over eighty years old, his personal faith remains strong 
and steadfast but he senses a lack of spirit in the church and longs for the 
time when brotherly and sisterly love was regularly practiced. 
In this interview, Mr. Vissage discusses certain aspects of mountain religion 
that have greatly declined in practice over the years. Though he misses these 
practices and feels that Christians and their churches are becoming lax in 
attitudes and forms of worship, he points to the fact that these changes could 
very well be setting the stage for Christ’s return. He says, ‘T think the Spirit 
is leaving the churches; in fact, my Bible says in one place of His teachings, 
‘Without a falling away, I will not come back.’ That’s why I think He’s 
getting ready to come back, because it’s going to be a wonderful experi¬ 
ence. ...” 
KEITH HEAD 
I joined the Methodist Church in 1914. At that time it was a 
union church. They split up and the Baptists pulled out and built 
that church up above it. 
I’ve seen some wonderful, wonderful times happen in that church. 
I wish I could see some revivals like we had back then, but the 
Spirit has just seemed to have left the churches. I don’t know why. 
I’ve seen my own mother shout up and down that aisle when I 
was a young child. You don’t see it any more. They don’t go for 
it and they wouldn’t accept it. If you hollered “amen” over there, 
I guess they’d think you were crazy.

FOXFIRE 7 
Those days are gone. There’s been some drastic changes, but I 
can’t say that it’s for the better. I think the Spirit is leaving the 
churches; in fact, my Bible says in one place of His teachings, “with¬ 
out a falling away, I will not come back.” I tell you there’s been a 
drastic form of falling away! That’s why, I think, He’s getting ready 
to come back, and I look forward to His coming back because it’s 
going to be a wonderful experience. I’m eighty years old and I 
know I haven’t got much time to stay here, but like I told the fellow 
the other day, “I’ve got a home up yonder that’s much better than 
this one. I want to go to it. I’ve got so many friends and relatives 
that has gone on and I believe they’re waiting on me.” 
I’d advise anyone—you boys, now I don’t know you, but if you’re 
not bom again, that’s the next step you’d better do. That’s the 
only way that can get you up yonder. Christ says that you’ve got 
to be bom again. You can’t explain that verse to most people. He 
had a hard time explaining it to Nicodemus. Nicodemus was an 
old, high Christian that thought he was it. He knew all about it 
but Christ told him, “You must be bom again.” 
Nicodemus said, “How can I be born again? How can I go back 
in my mother’s womb?” 
Then Jesus explained that you had to be bom again of the Spirit. 
They don’t teach it too much now. They don’t teach it in the Method¬ 
ist Church. We have quite a conflict over here in the church now 
simply because I feel no spirit in there. What we need to do is 
get back on the old track. Go back to the old King James Version 
and live it and preach it and practice it and then your church will 
grow; your church will be something that you can be proud of. 
[People used to take good care of each other like the Bible says 
Christians should.] They loved one another. I can remember back 
in these mountains where I was raised over here—most everyone 
was farmers. If anyone needed something done, it was done. Say 
you had a big crop of com and it had rained and the grass was 
taking it, you wouldn’t have to worry because your neighbors would 
take care of it for you. If there was a sickness in the family, they’d 
do it. That’s brotherly love. Where is it today? You don’t see it. 
It’s gone. If you get anything done today, you pay for it. You pay 
dear for it. That’s the way I’d like for it to be [again]. You won’t 
see it and I don’t expect it. 
It’s really sad when you get to studying about it. It’s really sad. 
There was at one time an old lady that lived down here and that 
old lady was quite a character. Everyone in the country knew her 
and everyone loved Granny Martin. She didn’t profess any religion, 
but I tell you right now, if anyone got sick, Granny Martin went

and she stayed until they got well. If you needed her, she was there— 
they won’t do that now. Her husband died and she had one boy 
that never would work and she’d get in quite a jam once in a while 
and people would help her. I remember one winter that she didn’t 
have anything to feed her animals. She came over to the house; 
she called my father “Fuzzy Bill” because he wore his whiskers in 
the winter. He’d quit shaving in September and wouldn’t shave until 
May. She said, “Fuzzy Bill, you’re going to have to go get my stock 
and bring them over here and keep them or they’re going to perish 
to death!” Well, we always had plenty of feed, kept a lot of stock, 
and sold plenty of feed, so we had plenty of grain. So we came 
and got them. One of them was an old jackass and he’d wake you 
up in the middle of the night hee-hawing! I was a kid and I remember 
those things. The way back then was the way God wanted you to 
live. You live for the Lord through other people. 
I was saved in the home. We moved from up here in 1906. We 
moved to town. My father wanted to go down there and raise cot¬ 
ton—you can’t raise cotton up here; it won’t open. You can grow 
it as high as your head, but it won’t open. I was in my second 
year of school and they were running a tent meeting right across 
the street from where we lived; in fact, the visiting preacher was 
staying at our house. The preachers would come out and eat dinner 
and go back and stay in a room. They were studying and praying 
until time for service. Just before service, they’d come out and walk 
around—maybe around town before service. Oh my, the people 
that was convicted in that meeting! I got under conviction—that 
was 1910—and I just fought it and I wouldn’t do anything about 
it. I went through that meeting and I felt every minute like I was 
going to die, and I got sick. Well, the Sunday school teacher and 
my youngest sister, one night about one o’clock, were sitting on 
the side of my bed and the Lord made a new creature out of this 
old boy. Yes, sir. I never will forget it. I could go back right now 
and put my hand in the corner of that room where it happened 
sixty-something years ago. 
I’m telling you! That’s the most wonderful experience! You can’t 
never experience anything like that. No, sir, you won’t! I was a 
new guy; I was a new creature. Old things were passed over and 
gone and everything was so beautiful, so light and so beautiful! 
Instead of a sick somebody, I was a well somebody and I haven’t 
had any more trouble. I’ve never been in the hospital and I’ve never 
stayed in the bed two days since then. Up until then I was a sickly 
kid. I was ten years old and only weighed sixty pounds. The Lord

I’ve done a lot of things I shouldn’t have done during this time. 
I’ve not lived as close to God as I should have. I went against Him 
lots and lots of times, but I’ll tell you right now, when you’re bom 
into that family, there isn’t any getting you out of it! I was bom 
in the Vissage family in 1896, and I was bom in God’s family down 
there in town in 1910 and I’m still in that family and there’s no 
getting me out of it! 
Did you have revivals back then ? 
Oh, boy. They’d last generally two weeks. I’ve seen so many reviv¬ 
als in my life that I couldn’t point out any special one but one. I 
had a sister and a brother that got saved in a revival just the summer 
after I was saved. It was a Wesleyan Methodist preaching. They 
run a revival and the church wouldn’t hold the people any night. 
When they made an altar call, they got there! There was a man 
preaching that had killed a man. He didn’t mean to; he hadn’t done 
it on purpose. He was born again and he was called to preach. All 
he could do about it was just cry, but he made one of the most 
dynamic preachers that I’ve ever heard. When that man got up be¬ 
hind that pulpit, you could feel the power. During that meeting 
there was a girl [who got saved] and I never will forget it. She 
was just a young woman and she got under conviction and she 
just wouldn’t go [up to the altar]. Right up to Saturday night she 
wouldn’t go. Finally she got up and started and just about the time 
she got up within a few feet of that altar, she fell—she pitched 
forward. That girl was lying there at one o’clock the next day. They 
got the doctor with her and they couldn’t account for it. Well, about 
two o’clock Sunday evening, she came up from there and she came 
up shouting and everyone in the village heard her. She made one 
of the most wonderful little missionaries that was ever in the African 
country. 
Have you ever been to camp meetings or brush arbors? 
Yes. I’ve been to numbers and numbers of brush arbors. They 
had brush arbors all around in this community when I was a boy. 
It might be a Baptist or a Methodist [meeting] or maybe they’d 
all join together. That’s what they used to do. They’d have a meeting 
and everybody went. 
They’d make little benches to sit on. They’d put that brush up 
there to knock the sun off of you and it’d turn a light shower if it 
would rain, but if it rained pretty hard, you’d get wet! From six 
years old and up I can remember brush arbors. It’s been forty or 
fifty years since I saw a brush arbor.

Were there any singings in this area? 
Sure. I had a bunch of cousins that lived over yonder at Highway 
28 and that whole family was musicians—five girls and two boys. 
They all played their own instrument and they all sang their part. 
Old man Doc Vissage was a bass; old man Lee Vissage was a baritone. 
Now old man Doc, I’m telling you, now he could get down under 
the floor with that old bass! I’ve never heard anyone sing like they 
did. They’d go all over the country and I’m telling you right now, 
when they went to a meeting, they really packed the churches. That’s 
one reason—and I’ll tell them right now—why we don’t have better 
services than what we have right now. We’re not singing those old 
hymns. We’re not singing them like we one time did. They’re not 
putting the spirit in it! Now that’s it! They get up there and sing 
some old thing that hasn’t even got any music in it, I don’t think. 
They sing two or three hymns and let the preacher get up there 
and talk about something besides the Bible mostly. That’s not wor¬ 
shipping God! You show me a church that has a dynamic choir 
and I’ll show you a church packed with people. That’ll do it. 
Have you ever seen any foot washings in the Methodist church ? 
In 1948, our preacher just pulled up and left and we didn’t have 
a preacher, only someone to come in and preach for [a few services 
at a time]. We wanted to get a preacher. So myself and two other 
men went over into the Ebenezer section to a church over there 
to talk to that superintendent and see if he’d get us a preacher. 
He said, “Let me study it for a week.’’ The next week he told us, 
“Well, I can send you a young man. He still lacks a little bit of 
being out of school and he’ll have two churches.” John Don Hayes 
was this boy’s name. He was a good man—a good boy—and I really 
loved him. Now, he was on fire for the Lord, that boy was! He 
was a good preacher and he could play the piano and sing. We 
were talking over there in my living room one day—me and a friend 
of mine—and John came down there. We were discussing the way 
[the church] u$ed to be and [John] said, “Let’s have a foot washing.” 
I told him, “Now you’re talking.” 
Next Sunday night after service, he says, “Let’s have a foot 
washing.” 
I said, “All right. Do you want to wash my feet or me to wash 
yours?” 
And he said, “We’ll wash both.” 
Well, I tell you, I was surprised at the people that joined it. I’ll 
tell you right now, we felt the Spirit, too! Now that was the only

time I’ve seen it happen in the Methodist church. Whether they 
used to do it, I can’t say, but I know that we did. 
Have you ever known anyone to be healed? 
Well, it happened to me. Doctors used to come to our house 
once or twice a week [to see me] before I was bom again. I don’t 
guess I’ve taken a half dozen doses of medicine since then. There 
isn’t anything the matter with me. I can’t see good. I’ve lost my 
sight, but I’m getting old and that’s natural. I can get about as 
good as I ever could. I can climb one of these mountains about 
as good as I ever could. Who’s doing it? I thank God for that! I 
don’t thank man. I thank Him for everything we have. Without Him, 
we haven’t got anything—not even the air we breathe. I know God 
can heal. I know He can. 
We had a preacher over here and he preached his last sermon 
just a few weeks back. He preached a real sermon over there one 
Sunday on Divine healing. Well, it surprised me. I hadn’t heard a 
Methodist preach on Divine healing in forty years, maybe longer, 
but he did. I said, “Brother Grant, you sure surprised me.” 
“Well,” he said, “I can’t help it, brother. I’ll preach it as long 
as I preach. My mother was healed and I know He can do it. I’ll 
preach it as long as I preach.” 
I told him, “Glory to God for you!” 
He said, “I’ll preach it as long as I preach and if they don’t like 
it, I’ll quit.” 
That’s the kind of man I like to hear! Stand up for God’s Word! 
Denomination doesn’t make one bit of difference in the world 
to me. If a church is working for the Lord, I’m for them; I don’t 
care what they call themselves. Baptists, Methodists, Church of God 
or what, I’ll be there just the same as anyone else. I’ll help them 
all I can because we’re all looking to go to the same spot. This 
here denomination stuff just won’t work. 
I wish people would go back to the old Bible, get right with the 
Lord and live by that old Bible. We’d have a lot better country. 
There wouldn’t be any friction between the churches. 
The Bible says “My Spirit will not always strive with man” and 
it’s not. It’s getting away from us. What’s doing it? They’re not 
preaching that word right. They’re not born again. They’re making 
a career out of preaching now. That’s why it is. I hate to see it so 
bad. I have grandchildren and I have great-grandchildren, but as 
time goes on, they’re going to come up in this and they’re going 
to be led astray, these grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I don’t 
know what’s before them.

E. C. PRESLEY, Methodist 
While en route to an interview in western North Carolina, we stopped at 
a small post office to make sure our directions were clear and accurate. As 
we were talking to the friendly postal worker, we happened to mention our 
religious study. He immediately told us about his father, E. C. Presley, and 
his many years of association with the church, and offered to call and set up 
a meeting so that we could talk with him later that day. We gladly agreed, 
the interview was set up and, after getting our initial directions clarified and 
a hand-drawn map to Mr. Presley’s home, we were on our way. 
Mr. Presley proved to be as cordial as his son. We set up our discussion 
on the front porch and Mr. Presley began recalling his religious experiences. 
A Baptist for 52 years, he is now a Methodist and said that the two denomina¬ 
tions always got along in his area, remembering “union” meetings and joint 
homecomings between the two. 
E. C. Presley is concerned that other present day activities are keeping people 
away from the church. He also senses a change in the overall mood of the 
church and its people, but at eighty years of age, he maintains the faith that 
has sustained him all of those years—a faith that becomes more important to 
him each day of his life.

The churches are not like they used to be. We’ve debated a whole 
lot about whether they’re in worse shape or better shape. Back when 
I was a young man and went to church that was about all there 
was to go to—that or the movie. Now there’s a ball game somewhere

nearly every night to watch and there’s TV and so many different 
things to go to. I think people get carried off with a lot of this 
stuff and maybe go a little too far with it. 
I joined the Baptist church when I was sixteen years old and I’m 
eighty years old now. I was a Baptist fifty-two years and then I 
joined the Methodist church. I like them just as well as I do the 
Baptists. My wife was a Methodist. We moved down to this commu¬ 
nity and they don’t have union Sunday school and church here, 
so I just joined with her so I could go with her to church. I changed 
because she don’t drive the car and it would’ve been a botherment 
[to attend different churches]. 
The Baptist people and the Methodist people cooperated together 
fine. I don’t know as where they ever had a dispute or an argument. 
My folks were all Baptists and I guess that was the reason I joined 
the Baptist church. Our Baptist preacher and our Methodist preacher 
were holding a series of [union] meetings and I got converted during 
one of those meetings. 
We had a Sunday school and I attended it. I got a diploma from 
the Baptist people. I passed the examination capable of organizing 
a standard Sunday school—that’s what the Baptists called it then. 
I was superintendent up there at the Baptist church for ten years. 
We’d have Sunday school at the Baptist church for three months 
and then we’d go to the Methodist church and have Sunday school 
over there. I’ve been the superintendent over at their church lots 
of times when their superintendent wouldn’t be there. If he wasn’t 
there, why, I’d take over. [The superintendent] had to take up Sun¬ 
day school and see that all the classes had a teacher. If one class 
was short of a teacher that Sunday, well, you had to either get a 
teacher or teach it yourself. I’ve done both. I’ve found teachers 
when I could and when I couldn’t, I’d teach myself. A Sunday school 
superintendent has got a right smart of a responsibility to run a 
good standard Sunday school. 
The Sunday school was actually the only thing [the Baptist and 
Methodist churches] combined on, except when they went to have 
a series of meetings—a religious gathering. When they run a meet¬ 
ing, they’d all come together then and have their meetings together. 
The regular preaching day, we’d go to the Methodist church for 
their preaching. They just had preaching once a month then. It 
isn’t like it is now. When we Baptists had our preaching day, they’d 
come over to our church. 
We’d have a revival up there about once a year. We’d either have 
it at the Methodist church or the Baptist church. We were all union. 
I think they have a homecoming together yet up there at Speedwell

[North Carolina]. That’s where most of our people’s buried. We 
go nearly every year. I don’t go out as much as I used to except 
to church here. It’s just a quarter mile from here out to the church. 
I believe in going to church. I always did believe in it. I went to 
church all my life. Oh, I’ve missed a few Sundays along—sickness 
or something like that—it can’t be helped. Back then I knew people 
to ride horseback two and a half miles to church on Sundays. I 
don’t know whether anyone would do that or not now. If they’ve 
got a car they might drive that far, if they’ve got a good place to 
park and don’t have to walk too far! 
Back when I joined the Baptist church, our church only had preach¬ 
ing services once a month. We had two days of it. [The preacher] 
came twice to the church, once on Saturday and then on Sunday 
morning. Now, they’ve done away with that Saturday meeting. Now 
we have preaching every Sunday morning. If our preacher can’t 
make it, why, he’ll get a preacher from Lake Junaluska, a retired 
preacher, to come over here. Our preacher has three churches and 
he tries to preach at every church every Sunday. That makes it awful 
hard on him. I wish our church was strong enough to where we 
could hire one pastor to be there every Sunday, but the church 
doesn’t have enough paying members to do that at this time. He’s 
trying to preach every Sunday at all three churches. That makes it 
awful hard on a preacher. I don’t see hardly how a preacher can 
hold out. The First Baptist Church here in Sylva [North Carolina] 
has preaching every Sunday. They have just one preacher to supply 
the church. They have a lot of members and they’re well able to 
pay a preacher just to have one church. That’s what I wish we had, 
but we’re just not able to. What members we have out here, we 
just can’t pay a preacher in full. We have to split up with some of 
the other churches. 
[The Baptist church] used to have singings. It was usually on 
Saturday night or Sunday evening but that’s kind of faded out of 
the picture, I believe. They still have a few, but they’re scattered 
wide apart. They sung more old-time hymns then. That’s what I 
liked—the old-time singing. Old man Jeff Moss used to teach singing 
schools. I went to one one time; I couldn’t sing. There isn’t no 
singing to me! I can’t keep a tune. 
I have been at a few places where they’d have judges [for a singing 
competition] and the judges would decide which one was the best 
quartet or class. Different communities had their own quartets. Up 
at Glenville [North Carolina] every September there’d be quartets 
from about three or four states come in and they’d compete against 
each other. There was a class come from Nashville, Tennessee up 

============================================================

there and they brought a little organ. They’d play this organ and 
sing. I’ve seen other classes with guitars. Each class usually had 
their own music and sometimes a class would sing without music. 
They don’t think it’s right to have a banjo in the church. The banjo 
and the fiddle’s mostly for dance music. Neither church don’t back 
that up. They had some real good singing [at Glenville]. This was 
a high school building where they were holding [the competition] 
and if you didn’t go pretty early, you didn’t get a seat. They went 
all out for it in that day and time. It might be different now, I 
don’t know. There’s so many other things to go to. 
[The church has changed in many ways.] The Baptist people, 
way back yonder, used to try people and turn them out of the church. 
I don’t know as the Methodist ever did that—not since I’ve gone 
to them they haven’t, but I’ve seen people tried up there in the 
Baptist church and they’d be dismissed from the church for some¬ 
thing they’d done. I don’t think the Baptists do that anymore. I 
think that they’ve decided it’s better just to take their name off 
the book and drop it at that, instead of getting up in front of the 
church and trying people. That isn’t fair. I don’t think that that’s 
right. It’s embarrassing. The preacher would bring [up the trial 
case in question] and then they’d be certain witnesses. It was like 
it was a real trial. If they found them guilty, they’d turn them out 
of the church. The ones that liked these people didn’t want them 
turned out—they had their friends—but still, the crowd run it over 
the one or two families and they turned them out anyway. Like 
say ... a girl in the community gets pregnant. Well, back then 
they’d take her up and try her; generally, they always convicted 
her and turned her out of the church. Now that’s a Baptist church 
only. I never seen that in the Methodist church. The Baptists don’t 
get their members up and try them and turn them out as I know 
of anymore. I haven’t heard of it in a long time. 
When I first started going to a Baptist church, they had foot wash¬ 
ings. They don’t do that anymore. I remember going to one foot 
washing up there—I hadn’t joined the church then—I was very 
small—but I went to this foot washing. A member of the church 
would pull his shoes off and I’d wash his feet or he’d wash mine. 
I haven’t seen that in church in years and years. I never did see it 
but one time and that was in the Baptist church. I never did know 
of the Methodist church having a foot washing. 
Back then you’d have a series of meetings and people would get 
happy and shout. You could have a meeting going on for two or 
three weeks and they’d have it every night and every day and there’d

be a lot of people’d get happy and shout. They shouted in both 
churches back then, but you hardly see anybody shout anymore in 
any church. 
There s another thing in the Baptist church that’s changed a little. 
You know they used to believe in closed communion, the Baptist 
people did. They’ve changed that. The Baptist people will come 
over to our church and they’ll take communion with us. Well, back 
yonder years ago, a Baptist wouldn’t take communion with the Meth¬ 
odist church, but they’ve changed that now, and it’s different than 
what it used to be. That’s the three things that’s changed in the 
fifty-two years I belonged. 
I tried to live right a long time. I’ve made lots of mistakes, but 
I never did give up faith. I’ve always held onto my faith. In these 
late years, it’s more serious now than it was back when I was in 
the prime of life. I’m taking it more serious now.T don’t have too 
much left to live for. I’m eighty years old now and don’t have many 
more years left. I’ve been on borrowed time ten years and I’m trying 
to live every day just like it might be the last day.

Similar to the Baptists, Pentecostals constitute a large denomina¬ 
tion characterized by diversity in the form of a number of Pentecostal 
types or subgroups. All Pentecostals, however, share common be¬ 
liefs, one of the most important being that each Christian should 
strive to “be filled with the Holy Spirit.” Evidence that this important 
event has occurred in one’s life is revealed by “speaking in tongues,” 
the utterance of an unknown language. Among other places in the 
Bible, “speaking in tongues” is referred to prominently in the second 
chapter of Acts, a book in the New Testament. This subject is thor¬ 
oughly covered in the interviews that follow. 
Pentecostals are in other ways distinctive, believing that they can 
receive other supernatural gifts. For example, they believe that some 
can be given the ability to prophesy, to heal, and that a select few 
can interpret the act of speaking in tongues. These gifts are also 
referred to in the New Testament, I Corinthians 12-14. 
This collection of interviews represents two Pentecostal schools 
of thought. Included are the Church of God, a large and influential 
denomination in the mountains, and the Fire Baptized Holiness 
Church. Those speaking for these groups were most receptive to 
our inquiries and we strongly feel that some of this publication’s 
most vivid accounts and recollections are included herein.

Ray Dryman, my great-grandfather, was the first person we interviewed 
concerning mountain religion and that interview was, I suppose, largely respon¬ 
sible for the conception of this book. I had intended to do an article for the 
magazine on the experiences of Grandpa, but after some discussion with Paul

and other members of the Foxfire staff, the idea of a more complex and complete 
book on religion was bom. 
Known to practically everyone in the Scaly community as “Uncle Ray, ” 
at age ninety-four he is the oldest member of that community. Grandpa helped 
usher the Pentecostal movement into Scaly and was largely responsible for 
the building of the Church of God there. Although he was never overly vocal 
in the church, his strong presence was felt by preachers and church members 
alike. Like a patriarch, he has always been one of the “cornerstones ” of the 
congregation and many are the times I’ve seen him going down the road, 
walking cane in hand, to the church about a mile from his home. 
Although Grandpa has recently suffered a stroke and can’t read the Bible 
daily as he had done for so many years, he still has the strength to occasionally 
attend the church he has loved so well. We feel that Grandpa is the true 
essence of the religious experience in the mountains and we thank him deeply 
for inspiring this publication.

I was married in 1910 and I got saved about eighteen months 
later. It was in 1911,1 guess. They had just run a Methodist meeting 
down here at the Methodist Church and I got under conviction 
and I was saved. I felt real good. I was hoeing cabbage when I 
got saved. I was hoeing and just got real happy. Wasn’t anybody 
there to hinder me. That was at home—down here at my old home- 
place. 
There is a lot of difference in the church now and back then. 
Back then, if anybody didn’t keep the teachings of the church, they’d 
turn them out. Now they don’t turn anybody out. I don’t know of 
anybody being turned out down here in a long time. Bessie, my 
daughter, was turned out of the church for cutting her hair. [They 
said] she was disorderly and broke the teachings of the church. 
This was the Pentecostal Church. They had a modest line of dress. 
The women were supposed to dress modest. Back then they wore 
dresses down around here [between the knee and shoetop]. They 
had to have old high top shoes; there weren’t any slippers worn

much then. And they didn’t wear short sleeves. Anybody knows 
what modest dress is and not to follow after the world. 
In what other ways could you “follow after the world”? 
By going anywhere that’s worldliness—these old bathing places 
and these old ball games. I don’t know what you might say, but 
they aren’t good places to go anytime. There’s all kinds of people 
there and it’s not a good place to be. I wouldn’t go to one at anytime. 
Do you remember when you went from the Methodist Church over into the 
Holiness Movement? 
Yes, I was superintendent of the Methodist Sunday school and 
this fellow, Frank Miller, came along. We went to school together 
and he had come into the Holiness way—the Church of God. He 
was running a meeting out here at his granddaddy’s. I was fixing 
to make a crop. He came along there in April on the road. I was 
at work by the fence. He stopped and got to talking. When he got 
ready to go, he said, “Ray, come over there to preaching.’’ 
I said, “Where is preaching?” 
He said, “Over at Grandpa’s, tomorrow evening.” 
I said, “I don’t know. I might come over.” So I came on down 
to Sunday school at the Methodist Church. I said to H. O. Penland, 
“Let’s go out and hear Frank Miller preach and see what he’s got 
to say. He grew up with us, you know. He was a good boy, never 
had any trouble, a fine boy.” So we went out there and he preached. 
He commented on the Church of God but his main theme was sancti¬ 
fication and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They believed that a 
person under the Spirit could handle snakes—pick up a snake—if 
the Spirit was on them and directing it. Well, I read the Bible and 
I didn’t doubt that; if the power of the Lord was on a man, he 
could do anything! 
So the next Sunday, I decided I’d like to go back. I figured that 
was about the best I’d ever heard and I got to reading my Bible 
to see. I had a New Testament—a brand new New Testament— 
and I got to reading that and went back there again and then I 
got to following his line. It was every bit Bible, but I’d never heard 
it preached before. [The Holiness doctrine] got up sort of a stir 
in this country and I said, “Fellers,” I said, “they’re right about 
it, they’re preaching the Bible!” 
I saw where I missed it. I sure had an experience. When I got 
the Holy Ghost, I was just going along down the road right [about 
where the Holiness Church is now], praying and meditating and 
the first thing I knew I was speaking in a new language. I reckon 
some people get it one way and some another. But that’s the way 

============================================================

I got it. I never was gifted in tongues but speaking in tongues is 
evidence of the Holy Ghost. That’s what they did on the Day of 
Pentecost. 
It wasn’t long until they had me rolled out down there [at the 
Methodist Church]. They told me they didn’t have much use for 
me down there. My church and everybody in the country fell out 
with me and so I quit the Methodist Church; just quit going. We 
had a time then. You never heard such a fuss. My folks all got 
mad at me. They just about disinherited me for a while. Because I 
went the wrong way they thought! I never did get many of them 
convinced [that I went the right way]. They didn’t like the idea. 
They [also] ran the [people that went to Holiness meetings] out 
of the Baptist Church and told them not to come around there. 
Toliver Vinson got the Holy Ghost and he went up there to the 
Baptist Church and told them he would talk a little bit with them. 
They told him not to come back up there with that kind of stuff— 
didn’t want any of it around there. I heard him not long ago, said 
they never had ask him to come back and he never had gone! 
The Holiness first held their services in people’s homes? 
Yeah, at old man Watkins’ and from there they came to Jim Kell’s 
and had church. They had church there at my house. I had an old 
store building and let them preach there, too. Just here, yonder 
and about, you know—everywhere you could get in and preachin’! 
Then I asked H. O. Penland up there about buying a lot [for a 
new church]. He said he’d sell it to us. I went to the brethren and 
they said, yes, that we would buy it. I think we paid a hundred 
dollars for it if I remember right—a half acre of ground. The church 
got it [the money] up. We just made it up. I remember how many 
members—eight or ten. Henry Miller and Meade Kell built the 
church and me and old man Miller hauled the lumber in from Rabun 
County to build it. 
Do you believe in Divine healing? 
I’ve seen people that said they were healed. I remember old lady 
Ledbetter was healed. I know of a child that had diphtherial croup 
that was healed. It was at the point of death and it never did use 
a bit of medicine—back over here on the Lloyd cove. They used 
to—the Church of God used to—call for people to come in and 
pray when they got sick. Well, they do yet. The church is not strong 
as it used to be in that line. They kind of drifted back. All churches 
have gone off. People had church back when I was growing up. 
People don’t live the good life like they used to. They’ve got too 
heady and high-minded.

How do you feel about snake handling and the handling of fire ? 
[Snake handling] is all right if you have the Lord directing you. 
But you better be careful and don’t try to handle snakes if He isn’t 
in it. But God has all power. The Hebrew children went through 
the fiery furnace and they came out. I’ve known people that has 
handled snakes. More than just one, too. I’ve known one fellow to 
get bit. In the early days of the church, they would handle snakes. 
Frank Miller got bit—the preacher got bit. They started to kill the 
snake and he said to hold on. I reckon he thought the Lord had 
given him power to pick it up. He picked it up and it bit him on 
the arm. A big rattlesnake. He got pretty sick but he never did 
take any medicine. The next Sunday he was preaching. They never 
did take him to the doctor. They just prayed for him. 
I’ve seen people handle fire. When we had that meeting there 
in my home, we had a lit fire there—it was a cold day. There were 
three people that handled fire that day. Just reached in there and 
picked up those coals and held them in their hands. No sign of 
fire on them. No sir, it never burned them. That convinced Toliver 
Vinson that people could handle fire. He wasn’t a member—he was 
just a sightseer. One fellow rubbed his hand along on the blaze. 
His wife was scared to death. She just knew his hand was burned 
off. Didn’t even singe a hair on him. He just sat there and rubbed 
that fire and looked back over the congregation and grinned and 
talked in tongues. That’s right. That was convincing, you know. 
When a fellow stands there and sees anything like that done, he 
knows there’s something to it. 
How do you feel about foot washings? 
I’ve never been to a Holiness communion but what we didn’t 
wash feet—all but one of them and that was down yonder at Gaines¬ 
ville. They had communion and they said nary a word in the world 
about washing feet. I said, “Well, that’s peculiar. I never knew Holi¬ 
ness people but what didn’t wash feet.” I went to another foot wash¬ 
ing before that one and I’ll tell you what I think—now I don’t know— 
but I think I know what the distraction was. Down here at Prentiss 
at a communion service they washed feet. Bee [his daughter,] was 
down there and there were lots of members—there is a big congrega¬ 
tion in that church. The women and men went into different rooms. 
They went in there and washed feet and I said to Bee, “Bee, boys, 
you had a crowd of them washing feet in there, didn’t you?” 
She said, “No, we didn’t have many.” 
I said, “Why?” 
“No,” she said, “they all had on panty hose and you couldn’t 
get to their feet!”

Did people shout when you were in the Methodist Church? 
Yes, they shouted! I’ve seen them shout, Methodist people. There 
was one fellow in my recollection that came here and preached. 
Let’s see, his name was Sam Perry and he came here to run a meeting. 
He was a Wesleyan Methodist and he’d preach sanctification. Boys, 
I’ll tell you he preached down there. I guess I was about eight years 
old, maybe nine. They had a tear-down over there in the Methodist 
Church. Boys, there were all these [people]. I don’t know who in 
all and those women just threw that snuff winding. Nearly everybody 
quit using their snuff. That old man, Raleigh McConnell, got religion 
in that meeting and he got up and down that aisle there just as 
flat of his back as ever you’d seen a fellow—just like he was dead. 
He was knocked right under that power, right there! That was in 
the old Methodist Church. It’s been tom down. 
[I remember another time] in Ashbury—-down at the Ashbury 
Methodist Church. They were having a revival down there. This 
Gudger fellow [was there]. He was sort of an idioty kind of fellow; 
wasn’t all there. But he was a pretty good old Gudger. [He was] a 
small fellow; I don’t guess he weighed over a hundred pounds. [Any¬ 
way,] everybody was getting happy and shouting; old man Gudger 
was back at about the middle of the church sitting right next to a 
window. [People] were just crowded in all around him and he said, 
“Give me room,” he said, “so I can shout.” It was in the summertime 
after dark and a couple of the boys just picked him up and set 
him out through the window out in the yard. And they said he 
just cussed that thing! He had room then! 
Could you tell us the story about Uncle Boos ? 
That was at the Church of God. They were having a testimony 
meeting down at the Church of God. Old Uncle Boos stayed out 
there at old man Watkins’ but old man Watkins had died and Boos’ 
sister’s boy just came in there and kind of scrounged the old man, 
Boos, out. He went down to old man Miller’s to live with his sister. 
[Anyway] they were having a testimony meeting and all the people 
were around testifying and after awhile, old Uncle Boos got up to 
testify and he said, “Well, I just don’t know. I’ve been hammer- 
pecked, hen-pecked here, yonder, and about and I don’t hardly know 
where I’m at and I don’t really know if I’ve been saved or not.” 
And he said, “I don’t believe I’ve ever been sanctified and I know 
I don’t have the Holy Ghost.” He took off up the aisle just shouting. 
Tickled me to death!

TOLIVER VINSON, Church of God 
Toliver Vinson is another one of those who pioneered the Pentecostal move¬ 
ment into the Scaly Mountain Community. He has always been one of the 
leaders of the church and has taught the adult Sunday school class for many 
years. He and his wife, Ruby, are still closely tied to this community as are 
many of their children and grandchildren. 
It takes a dedicated person to stand up to adversity and disapproval from 
one’s friends and associates. Many years ago a riff existed between the “main¬ 
line” fundamental churches and the newer Pentecostal movement and we admire 
Toliver Vinson because, in spite of that riff and the disdain of many of his 
peers, he stayed with and remained faithful to the Pentecostal movement. Later, 
as the different churches tolerated each other more and started cooperating 
toward the reaching of a common goal, Toliver Vinson became one of the 
most respected members of the community. 
KEITH HEAD 
I was saved in the Baptist church. I was also sanctified there in 
revival and received the Holy Ghost before I came to the Church 
of God. Claude McConnell and a whole bunch of boys were praying 
on the altar and I was praying with them. The first thing I knew, I 
went kind of limber and I knew there was something happening 
and I was sanctified right there. A few days before the revival was 
over, I received [the baptism of] the Holy Ghost.

My daddy used to say he was praying for a double portion [to 
be saved and to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost] and I used 
to tell him that if he got a double portion he could hardly live. 
He couldn’t make it! But in a revival up there [at the Baptist church], 
he got so far along that he was in a trance or something—he was 
that way for about a week. He was the happiest man you ever saw 
and he couldn’t do his work and I told my mother, “Don’t worry 
about him. We’ll do the work. Let him enjoy himself and have a 
good time.” So he must have got a double portion! 
They started preaching “Holiness” here [at Scaly Mountain] about 
1914 or 1916. When it [the Church of God] first started out it was 
up there at Ray Dryman’s in an old store building. They used to 
have a post office there and I attended their meetings when I was 
about twelve or fourteen years old. There was just one door and 
one window and they had a table and a lamp, one of those kerosene 
lamps, on the table. There were so many shouting and carrying 
on. I was a little excited and afraid. I thought about jumping out 
that window! I knew that if I jumped out that window, I’d knock 
the lamp out! If I’d knocked it off, people would’ve been in the 
dark. I always wanted to [be as well mannered] as I knew how to 
and not hurt anybody. I decided to stay with them. That was about 
the best thing that I could do. Everything quietened down after a 
while and my nerves did too, a little bit! 
Why did you leave the Baptist church and join the Holiness movement ? 
The [Baptist] church just about made up my mind for me. They 
said I’d have to leave off that speaking in tongues and so forth if 
I stayed with them. They said their conference just wouldn’t put 
up with it. The deacons talked with me and they said that if I’d 
leave that speaking in tongues off that I could stay with them. I 
told them no, I wouldn’t do that because the Lord had given it to 
me and that I appreciated them and loved them and loved the church 
but I wasn’t compromising with them or anybody else. 
The only bad thing that happened after they asked us not to be 
there speaking in tongues [occurred at a revival]. The [Baptist] 
church had a revival and invited us back and everyone was welcome. 
There were quite a few Pentecostals there and a lot of people were 
in prayer. Brother Lawrence Talley and myself were praying and 
probably speaking in tongues. We used to wear those little sailor 
hats—straw hats—and they were hung up there [toward the front] 
somewhere. The preacher got hold of one and sailed it across toward 
a bunch of us. He might have been throwing it at Lawrence Talley 
but it hit me. It hit me right across the forehead; of course, it didn’t

hurt much. That was the only physical thing that happened. That 
was kind of surprising; I’d thought a lot of the preacher but there 
was something wrong with him or he wouldn’t have done something 
like that. 
Do you remember when the old Methodist church was up here in Scaly Moun¬ 
tain? 
Years ago, I saw those old lady Methodists “dance” and their 
hair would get down and almost pop and crack. They’d dance and 
run the benches just like Pentecostals do now. I’ve seen them jump 
from one bench to another. Looks pretty scary in a way. It’s enough 
to excite a lot of people, kids and so on. In a way, it’s kind of 
unbelievable to anybody that doesn’t know anything about it. They’d 
get in the Spirit and if that’s what they wanted to do and what the 
Lord wanted them to do, it’s all right. I don’t want to do something 
like that, but I wouldn’t condemn it. 
Can you remember any revivals ? 
I remember—I guess it was in the forties—we had a revival that 
lasted for six weeks and it looked like the whole country was going 
to get saved. They had big revivals all along. The old church building 
would reel and rock when the people’d shout and carry on. My 
dad used to be pretty hard on the “Holiness.” He’d say it was of 
the devil—all that speaking in tongues. After that big revival, he 
never was hard anymore. He joined the Church of God. He was a 
member of it when he died. 
They had those [camp meetings] but I didn’t go to them. They 
had buildings [for them] over at Hayesville and Shooting Creek. 
They used to have conventions about the same as camp meetings 
that’d last about two or three days but those old camp meetings 
would last about a week or ten days—a brush arbor or something 
like that. The only thing [like that] that I ever went to was an outside 
tent. They used to have quite a few of them at Clayton and Mountain 
City. One fellow out there at Mountain City bought an old tent 
that had quite a few holes in it. When it rained, you had to hunt a 
place where it was dry. I heard him say one time that when anybody 
got blessed in that tent, he got blessed, too! 
Have you ever seen anybody handle fire ? 
Up there at Ray Dryman’s we were having a cottage prayer meet¬ 
ing. We had it quite often and there were a lot of people there 
and Ray always had a big fire and hickory logs [burning]. [He had] 
a big old fireplace and that thing was really red hot. Of course, I 
was new in the Pentecostal way. They got to shouting and speaking 

============================================================

PLATE 44 Keith Head and 
Toliver Vinson. 
in tongues and so forth; there was three or four or five, maybe, 
and they’d just dip into those big logs that were on fire and pick 
them up. After it was over with, I wanted to be sure that they were 
doing that. I had some of the boys go out on the porch. [They] 
had water out there and I had them to wash their hands. Their 
hands were pretty smutty and [after they washed], their hands were 
just as clear [and unburned] as mine. 
I’ve seen a half dozen at a time going right into the fireplace 
and picking up those logs and not getting burned. We used to have 
a log stove in the old church [Church of God] up here with a pipe 
running out and that thing was about red hot and it was about to 
fall over. Some of them caught that thing and carried it around 
there and put it back on. You don’t see that much anymore. 
How do you feel about handling snakes ? 
People have handled snakes. It can be done; it’s the Word. It’s 
supposed to be done in its place and for a purpose—the right time 
and the right place and so forth. One of our neighbors, years ago, 
got bit and was in pretty bad shape but they say he handled snakes 
after that. I’d have to be right knocked out before I’d handle any! 
How do you feel about Divine healing? 
I’ve seen people healed. It doesn’t take long. The Bible teaches 
that it’s not an amount of words or a lot of speaking—the Lord 
hears [anything]. I went to my sister’s and she’d been sick and in 
the bed for a week. I went in and I said, “The doctor has already

come”; and you know, she rose out of that bed and went to shouting 
and helped to fix lunch that day. 
I was over at Hayesville one time at a convention and this man’s 
wife was sick. He was a representative of the county and he invited 
me [and another man] to take dinner with him. His wife was sick 
and had been in the bed for about a week. I thought, “Boy, what 
are we going to do about dinner.” He’d invited us for dinner. 
He said, “Let’s have prayer; my wife has been sick for a week 
or more.” 
So we prayed for her and she got up and helped her husband 
fix our dinner for us. 
Ruby, my wife, had a bad pain and she could hardly work. Her 
side was hurting some way and Brother Larry was preaching and 
a lot of people began to shout; it seemed like electricity or something 
went all over the building. He believed in Divine healing; he’s proba¬ 
bly got the gift of healing. Anyway, there were a lot of people healed 
and they said for everybody to join hands. I could feel something. 
It seemed like a light above sunlight went through the building 
and Ruby was healed. She hasn’t been bothered with that pain in 
the side anymore. It was just like electricity—went right through 
us. There were a lot of people holding hands. There must’ve been 
six hundred, eight hundred people there. 
I’d [also] like to tell you about my dad. He could stop blood; I 
know he could. The last few years that he lived, when we’d kill a 
hog, we’d just about have to send him away from home. The hog 
wouldn’t bleed and would hardly die. He wouldn’t say he could 
[stop blood] but you’d tell him an animal or a person was bleeding 
and the biggest part of the time it’d soon stop. I know that to be 
a fact. We boys tried to get him to tell us how it was done and he 
said he was only supposed to tell one person. My daddy would 
forget sometimes, and he’d get my mother to read the verses to 
him; they’d get off in the room somewhere. When he had a good 
memory, he’d know it. But after he got old, he’d have my mother 
take a Bible and go off into the room and she’d read the verse or 
verses, whatever it was. He’d go places; maybe a horse or cow or 
something would get cut. Maybe a cow would get her udder almost 
cut off and about bleed to death. They were always taking him [to 
stop blood]. 
I’ve known people that weren’t even saved to stop blood. They’d 
use some verse from the Bible so I guess it’d be all right. You 
know, anybody that honors good, even if they are a sinner, the 
Lord will honor them. That’s what the Bible says.

GRANNY REED, Church of God 
/ have been acquainted with Granny Reed, as she is best known, for quite 
a while. I remember, as a young child, going with my family to the Assemblies 
of God camp meeting at Cullasaja, North Carolina. There in the old sawdust- 
floored tabernacle nestled near the slow, lazy Cullasaja River, the rafters would 
seem to swell as the people offered their prayers, praises, and the “songs of 
Zion” unto God. At some point during the service, “testimonies” would be 
given. Voluntarily, people would stand and publicly tell what God had done 
for them. Then Granny Reed would get slowly to her feet and as all eyes 
focused on her, she'd begin, “Children, I've been walking with the Lord many 
a year now. ...” When she finished, there were few dry eyes and even fewer 
sad hearts in the congregation. 
Granny Reed is ninety-four years old. For a long time she was a Baptist, 
but now she is a member of the Church of God in western North Carolina. 
Those who have come to know Granny Reed love her simply because of the 
love she shows toward them. I have never seen her without being greeted 
with a warm hug, and hearing her say, “God bless you.” Granny Reed is a 
testimony and a credit for both the Church of God and Christianity. 
KEITH HEAD 
I have been a Christian about seventy-eight years. I’m ninety-four 
now. I was converted when I was twelve years old. It’s been a long 
time. Then it wasn’t like it is now. We didn’t know anything about 
the deep things of God. We just knew the born-again experience. 
And we really did have a born-again experience in those days. 
I never had thought about being a sinner. I never had thought 
about it. I was going along a little barefooted girl. We always went 
barefoot until we were in the teens in those days. I was going along 
and kicking up sand and playing, you know.

My daddy said “huh” like that. When he said that, I knew he 
wanted to say something. I said, “What is it. Dad?” 
He said, “You’re old enough to know what you’re going to church 
for, instead of playing along like that.” 
I stopped and I thought, “Well, does Daddy think I’m a sinner?” 
I began to study about it. I thought, “Well, him and Momma pray 
for me every night and I’m a child of God surely.” I stood there 
and waited until he got in front of me and I dropped in behind 
him and started on toward the church. 
I cried till I thought I couldn’t cry. I thought, “Oh, dear God, 
I’m a sinner and I’ll be left here. Mother and Daddy goes to heaven 
and I’ll be left.” It troubled me to death. These days, children don’t 
pay any attention to things like that. But, oh, it broke my heart. I 
went on into church, I had a little cousin; her daddy was my mother’s 
brother and he was a preacher. He was preaching. I went in and 
scrooched down beside of her and said, “Zadie, if you was to die, 
would you go to hell?” Me and her was the same age. 
She said, “I don’t know, Rosie. Papaw prays for us every night 
and I never thought nothing about it.” 
I said, “Daddy thinks we’re sinners. He thinks we’re old enough 
to know what to do.” 
She said, “I guess we are. We’re twelve years old.” 
We sat there awhile and I said, “I’m going to the altar when 
they call. I ain’t gonna risk it another night, for Jesus might come 
tonight.” 
She said, “They’ll make fun of us and us barefooted.” 
I said, “I don’t care. I’d rather be made fun of than to go to 
hell.” 
She said, “If you go, I will.” 
So whenever they had the altar call, we went and just knelt and 
cried. We didn’t know how to pray or nothing. In a little while, 
they broke up [the meeting] and we didn’t get saved. Oh, how bad 
I was troubled. I went to the church door and I said, “Uncle Isaac, 
do you care if me and Zadie don’t go home for dinner?” 
He laid both of his hands on our heads and said, “God bless 
you, children. Stay if you want to.” 
So when they all got out of sight, me and Zadie (we was right 
by the river at the old Brush Creek Church) went up the river to 
an old sheltering rock and we walked in between them rocks. I 
looked at her and said, “Zadie, do you know how to pray?” 
She said, “No, I don’t. Papaw does the praying.” 
I said, “I don’t know how. For Daddy and Mother both prays. 
And I don’t.”

We stood and looked at each other for a while and she said, 
“Well, we could say, ‘God, be merciful to us a sinner’ for we’re 
sinners.’’ 
We knelt and prayed and cried. We didn’t know what to say except 
“God, be merciful to us sinners.’’ We cried and cried and when 
they came back to the church, we ran down to the river and washed 
our faces and pushed our hair and went on into the church. I never 
heard anything the preacher said, I was so anxious to get to the 
altar to get saved before dark, because I didn’t want to risk it after 
dark, Jesus might come, I might die, and oh, I couldn’t stand it. I 
never heard anything said. And the minute they called the altar 
call, we went. We went and we prayed and we prayed. I was praying 
so hard and Zadie was too. After a while she jumped up and came 
flying to me and said, “Oh, I’m saved, and God’s going to save 
you.’’ 
Well, I thought I was the vilest sinner on earth. He’s saved Zadie 
and he ain’t saved me. That made me worse than ever. I liked to 
cried my heart out. 
I said, “God if you don’t save me now, I’m going to die. I’ve 
done everything I know how to do and I don’t know anything else 
to do.” When I said that, an awful feeling came over me. I was 
mashed down low and lower. I couldn’t hear them singing or noth¬ 
ing. I felt like I was going through the floor. All at once, it begun 
to come up like that. And when it come up, there I was standing 
in the floor. Everything was as bright as sunshine. I jumped just 
as high as I could. I jumped and grabbed Uncle Isaac and hugged 
him. My daddy was just parting the people trying to get to me. 
Well, I thought they was the prettiest people I’d ever seen in all 
my life. Never after that did I doubt my experience. I know I was 
bom again. 
Well, I was determined to live in His steps. All my life I’ve wanted 
to live in His steps. And when anyone asks me to go to a show or 
a ball game or place of music, I would just say, “Now would Jesus 
go there if He was here?” No, He wouldn’t be there. He'd be some¬ 
where else, praying or reading or doing some good to people. I 
never have been to a ball game or a theater in my life. I’ve just 
tried to follow in the steps of Jesus. 
As quick as the light of Holiness came into this country, I was 
there. The Lord spoke to me and told me to go or I wouldn’t have 
gone, because I didn’t know what kind of people they was and I 
was afraid of them. But you know, I was almost dead. I was sick. I 
was awfully bad off. I had an abscess in my side and I’d been operated 
on, but it didn’t do any good. I was going to die. I knew I was. I

had my family, two boys and a little girl. I said, “Lord, I hate to 
die so early and leave my family. My little girl needs me so bad, 
she’s so sick all the time.” 
You know, whenever I told the Lord that, I just laid there a little 
while and He spoke to me in an audible voice and said, “Go down 
to the Holiness tent meeting and I’ll heal you.” 
I didn’t know it was the voice of the Lord. It scared me so bad. 
I looked all over the room. He’d never spoke to me in an audible 
voice before. I looked everywhere and there was no one around. I 
lay there just a-trembling. 
I stayed till the next morning, laid there studying about it. Next 
morning, I said, “That didn’t sound like a wicked voice. It must 
have been the Lord.” 
But why would He ask me to go to that place—a Holiness place? 
They’re wicked people (for I thought they were). I’d been taught 
that! All at once it came again, “Go down to the Holiness tent 
meeting and I’ll heal you.” 
I said, “Lord, I ain’t able.” I couldn’t raise up without fainting. 
I was awful bad off. 
He said, “I’ll make you able.” And that was the last I heard. 
I thought to myself, “If that’s Jesus, I’ll put my feet down on 
the floor and try it and see and if I don’t faint, I’ll know that it’s 
Him.” Well, I got out on the side of the bed and I turned myself 
this and that a-way. I didn’t feel like I was going to faint, and I 
said, “Now, Lord, if it’s you that’s leading me in this way, let me 
walk in the living room there and sit by the fire.” I got up and 
walked, but I was stiff and sore. I walked in there and sat down. 
My mother-in-law, Mother Reed, was waiting on me in there. She 
looked in and saw me and said, “How come you ain’t in bed? Who 
brought you in here?” She knew I couldn’t walk. 
I said, “The Lord.” When I said that, she thought I was out of 
my head. She ran out and called my husband. He come in and I 
told him about the Lord speaking to me. 
He led me right on in and he said, “Well, go to the Holiness 
church. We’ll go down there if He promised to heal you.” 
And I said, “Yes, we’ll go.” I was still afraid to, nearly, but I 
went. That’s where I got into the light of Holiness; it’s been about 
fifty years. I never got healed until I got the baptism of the Holy 
Ghost for I didn’t ask to be. [The preacher] just had his healing 
services on Friday night. After I went down there on Friday, I thought 
I was going to get healed that day. They had cards to give out 
and the ones that had cards went up to give them to him and stood 
in line. I didn’t have one and I didn’t go. Oh, I was disappointed

so bad. When he got through praying for the sick, I could just 
feel down there to see if I was healed, and I’d say, “No, I’m not 
healed. It’s still there—that sore place.” I studied about it. 
When he got through, he said, “Everybody that’s sick and afflicted, 
hold up your hand.” Well, I held up my hand real high. I was afraid 
to let it down; afraid he’d miss seeing me. He came to me and 
handed me a little card and bowed and went back. 
Well, I had to go home with that. I didn’t know nothing else to 
do. When I got home I read that card. “Are you saved? Have you 
been baptized with the Holy Ghost? How long have you been sick? 
Do you believe God can heal you? Will you read your Bible and 
pray daily?” 
I said to my husband, “I don’t know how to answer this card. I 
can answer every one but there’s a distinction here between ‘Have 
you been saved?’ and ‘Have you been baptized with the Holy Ghost?’ 
There’s something else to it some way. I reckon I have been baptized 
in the Holy Ghost. I was baptized in the Father, Son, and the Holy 
Ghost.” 
He said, “No, Rosie. There’s something else to it. I’ll tell you 
what to do. I’ll take you down there Monday morning and let you 
stay with your Aunt Minnie (she lived right there by the tent) till 
you find out something about it before next Friday.” Next Friday 
was the healing night. 
Sunday morning I was so heartsick about everything, I couldn’t 
eat a bite. I said, “I don’t want nothing to eat.” I went on to my 
aunt’s and told her not to fix anything for me to eat. I wanted to 
know something about the Lord before I eat anything more. I just 
got convicted to death! I never eat a bite for three days and nights. 
The first night of the revival he preached about the baptism of 
the Holy Ghost and I’ve never in my life had my eyes opened so. 
It just struck me that I’d die or have that gift. 
I said, “Lord, here I am. Been a Christian all these years and 
thought I was walking in the steps of Jesus and I ain’t even halfway 
started!” I felt awful about it. I went on fasting and praying and 
on Tuesday night—that was three days and nights that I had fasted— 
I went in there and told the Lord that now I was ready for the 
baptism and I said, “Now You give it to me. I’m setting way back 
here in the tent and nobody won’t know that I’m wanting it.” 
Well, it came down just like a shower of rain. It was like a funnel 
in the tent just r-o-o-a-a-r-r-i-i-n-n-g. I fell over on the bench and 
my lips felt like they were an inch thick. I said, “I won’t disturb.” 
And when I said that, it just left me like that. Then I sat there a 
little while and I said, “Lord, did I imagine all of that?” I never

had such feelings in all my life. I said, “You didn’t get mad at Gideon 
for putting out a fleece twice. If I ask You to send it one more 
time, then I’ll know it’s You.” And it come again. 
Right then the preacher was saying to everyone that wanted the 
baptism to go into the prayer room. Well, I said to the entire congre¬ 
gation, “Come on, children, this is of God. I done asked Him.” 
I went in there. There wasn’t no room at the benches. They was 
all lined up. I just knelt down right in the middle of the floor and 
received it. 
Oh, yes Honey. They turned me out of the church and wouldn’t 
have a thing to do with me. My own people wouldn’t ask me home 
with them. First time I went to my own church, I thought I’d be 
the greatest help to them in the world, and they just turned their 
backs on me. 
I went up through the old field. I was walking by myself, all alone. 
My daddy was against me; everybody was against me. I went on 
to the top of the mountain and looked back over the mountain 
and I said, “Lord, if nobody in this earth speaks to me anymore, 
my daddy nor nobody, I’ll walk these hills alone with You. I’ll never 
turn back.” I’d cried all the way up the mountain. I was heartbroken 
because they had treated me so dirty, and I hadn’t got to where I 
didn’t have a lot of feelings, then. 
When I said that, the glory of the Lord came down on me and 
just wrapped around me a sheet of love. Oh, how happy it made 
me. I shouted all the way down. I never cried anymore about my 
church. He took it away. But they turned me out. 
They didn’t know any better. My poor old daddy said I’d sure 
land up in an asylum—I’d gone plumb crazy. Yeah, he thought he’d 
have to send me to the asylum. 
But my mother just accepted every bit and got the baptism in 
my house. Oh, she was like me, she wanted all the Lord had for 
her. My daddy was good, but he was scared to death; he thought 
it was some kind of strange doctrine. But before he died, he said 
he saw the light. He said he knowed it was right. 
I was brought up in a good Christian home. They had their family 
prayer, and they made us go to church and never thought of nothing 
but doing right. I never heard my mother nor my dad say a dirty 
word in my life nor never seen nothing wrong out of them. They 
was good people. My daddy thought that the only religion in the 
world is the Baptist. He just thought that was it. But Mother could 
see a little further in the distance. 
I said one day, “Mother, what does it take to be holy? I don’t 
do nothing wrong.” I thought the Holiness people didn’t eat meat 

============================================================

PENTECOSTALS 
2!5 
back then. So I said, “I don’t care about meat. I can do without 
that. Why can’t I be holy?” 
Mother said, “Honey, there’s something to it I don’t understand, 
but if we keep reading and praying and trusting God, one of these 
days we’ll find out what Holiness is.” She knew we should be holy. 
But my daddy thought it was holy enough to be Baptists. 
[The Holiness] didn’t indulge in the worldly things in life. They 
didn’t think it was right, and I don’t yet. I don’t think we can be 
two people. I think we either have to belong to God or not at all. 
I think we have to turn loose of the things of the world that’s got 
any foolishness in it at all, because the Bible says that all that is 
not good is bad. If you don’t find any good in something, there 
isn’t any use to partake of it. 
There was a little girl, and sandbones had eaten her backbone 
out to where she was in a steel brace, and she hadn’t put her feet 
on the floor to stand up for seventeen months. She was sitting in 
a wheelchair with her steel brace on. 
They drove the car up to the tent and raised up the tent close 
to where the preacher was preaching where she could listen at him 
preach on Divine healing. Well, the preacher was boarding at their 
house, and he went on home that night. When they came back and 
started to carry her out of the car, the preacher said, “Just let her 
alone. She’s going to walk to the house tonight.” 
And he went around and laid his hand on her and prayed a few 
words—he didn’t ever pray but just a few words—and she leaped 
out of that car and ran to the house! She ran in and she ran upstairs 
and jerked that steel brace off and put on her clothes. She went 
into every one of the bedrooms of her brothers and woke them 
up and told them what God had done for her. She’s still alive yet! 
Oh, I don’t know of the healings that took place up there. They 
brought one woman from the hospital that they’d given up to die, 
and the preacher went out to the car and prayed for her and she 
was healed perfectly. There’s been lots of healings since. 
I’ve prayed for people and they was healed time and time again. 
But it seems like these days that it’s harder to get through to victory. 
I don’t know why. I went to a little baby that was dying of diphtheria 
and its little head was swelled up and its eyes was rolled back in 
its head. They was going to take it to the hospital, and they had 
to wait for the train to run before they got there. They thought 
the baby was going to die before the train got there, so they called 
for me. I never had seen the people. I ran down there and I asked 
the Lord as I went on, did He want me to pray for it secret or 
out loud. I said, “If You want me to pray in secret, You cause the

woman to ask me to lay my hands on it. I know You’re going to 
heal it, Lord, but I want to know how to pray about it.” 
So when I went in, she was holding it. The baby was about two 
years old and you couldn’t see nothing but the whites of its eyes 
and it was gasping, trying to breathe—couldn’t breathe hardly at 
all. 
And the mother said, “Lay your hand on its little neck and see 
how hard it is. It’s like a rock.” And I knew then so I just lay my 
hand on its neck and began to rub and say, “Thank you, Jesus” 
in my heart. Every drop of that swelling just oozed out and the 
fever left. That little thing popped its eyes open and looked at me 
and laughed. It jumped down and out its mother’s lap and run 
into the kitchen, got a stick of stove wood, and it came back pecking 
on the stove and looking at me and laijghing. It hadn’t seen me 
before but it was tickled to death. It knew something had happened! 
It was well from that day on. 
The man come in and he said, “What in the world happened?” 
The baby was just playing and laughing and running around me. 
Mrs. Blair said, “Miss Reed just laid her hand on its neck and it 
got well in a few minutes!” 
And he said, “Well, there ain’t no use to go to the hospital, is 
there?” 
I said, “No, your baby’s all right, Mr. Blair. It’s all right.” 
I never told them what happened and next morning, I felt con¬ 
demned about it. I didn’t know what to do so I went back and 
asked her if she knew what made the baby well. And she said, “You 
prayed for it.” 
I said, “Yes, Jesus healed it.” Then I told her how God did work 
through people. 
[Editor’s Note: Shortly after our interview with Granny Reed, she phoned 
to tell us about a vision she’d had and to see if we wanted to record it. 
Keith and Wendy went back to her home and she related the following experi¬ 
ence.] 
I was very sick on my bed. I told Jesus I wouldn’t pray that night. 
I was so tired and sick I just said, “Lord, remember all my objects 
of prayer. Keep Your loving hand on them for good, and all the 
churches that are trying to please You.” Then I turned over with 
my face to the wall, and my eyes got wider and wider, and I felt 
all disturbed inside. I looked up and said, “Lord, what is it? I don’t 
feel like I will ever go to sleep.” It seemed that I had died a natural 
death, and I was carried to the entrance of heaven in the arms of 
angels, very softly. I did not see anyone. But I stood on my feet. I

opened my eyes and looked, and there stood Jesus. I looked from 
His head to His feet. Oh, I can’t express it! I just cried out and 
said, “Oh, how wonderful, wonderful, wonderful You are!” I said, 
“Lord, I have been looking for You and been praying for You to 
comfe and stop these awful wars and crime, and bring peace on 
the earth. But You didn’t come.” 
Well, I said that, and He moved up to me as the wind swept 
Him, and laid His arm around on my shoulders, and looked straight 
into my eyes and said, “No, I didn’t come. The time is short, but 
My children are not ready.” 
Oh, how sad He looked! I said, “Lord, I thought all Your children 
were ready.” 
He said, “No, no. Very, very few.” 
I said, “Why, Lord?” 
He said, “They have too many weights to overcome and too many 
spots on their garments. They won’t be able to rise and meet Me 
when I come in the clouds of Glory, for I’m coming for a church 
without spot or wrinkle.” 
Then I said, “Lord, if they are Your children, what is their spots 
they haven’t overcome?” 
He said, “Hate, jealousy, grudgery, selfishness, pride, and the 
cares of this world. They are all wrapped up in the world until 
they are ashamed to be called a Christian.” He looked at me and 
said, “I am sending you back to the world to tell My children to 
repent, and need filling with the Holy Spirit. For the time is short, 
and My children are not ready.” 
I said, “Lord, please don’t send me back! I want to stay with 
You.” 
But He said, “Not now. Go back and warn My children the time 
is short.” Then He vanished out of my sight. 
I looked all around and I was in my bed—I felt of my pillow to 
see if it was real. There was no sleep for me that night. I cried 
and talked all night. I said, “Lord, I can’t tell it. They will all say 
that I am crazy, or dreamed it, or imagined it, Lord. I just can’t 
tell it.” 
So, next morning, it was all before me all day. But I didn’t speak 
about it, and that night it all happened again. I died, and I was 
carried to the entrance of heaven again. He told me the same thing. 
He told me to tell all the churches I could. And He looked at me 
so kind, and said, “Can I trust you?” 
And I said, “Yes, Lord. I will tell it if no one believes. I will tell 
it.” And I told even the Baptist church, the Assembly, and the Church 
of God, and all that will listen at home.

My granddaughter asked me, “Grandma, what will Jesus do with 
those that won’t repent and overcome?’’ And the Book of Revelations 
opened at the third chapter and I said, “Honey, this is what the 
Bible says, ‘He that overcomes shall be clothed in white reignments 
and I will not blot his name out of the lamb of the book of life, 
but I will confess his name before My Father and angels.’ ” 
And she said, “Oh, their names will be blotted out if they don’t 
repent.” I pray to God His children will repent before their names 
are blotted out. Remember, time is short. 
This all happened to me about three years ago. As I write this 
all down, I know I will not be here long with my brothers and 
sisters to warn you. As I write this, I trust someone will be glad. 
Please forgive my bad writing. My age is eighty-six in six months. 
I’ve been a child of God seventy-three years, and have loved every 
minute of these years. God bless all who read this. You’re in my 
prayers, and God bless all.

I was called [to preach] when I was just a boy. I was about ten 
when I got called by the Lord. During rainy days, I would get up 
in the barn loft and make me a little Bible stand and do like I was 
preaching. One day—I never will forget—doing like I was preaching 
and my dad walked in. He said, “Son, what are you doing?” He 
didn’t understand [at that time]. But I felt the calling of the Lord 
upon me then and I realized I was to preach. I could see by a 
vision multitudes of peoples back when I was a boy and I was preach¬ 
ing to them. 
When I was sixteen I received the Baptism of the Holy Ghost 
and was saved. The Church of God came into the community of 
Cartoogachaye and began to preach in a little log cabin. My oldest 
brother and I would go to these services. Back then [some] people 
were against Holiness, worse than they are now. When they came 
into a community other denominations would fight them. They 
didn’t want their children to go to these services because of what 
they [Holiness] believed in. I’d go to these services and would see 
how the Lord worked and how the power of God would fall. [It 
would fall] so strong in that little log cabin that it would actually 
shake the little building. It scared my brother; he thought it was 
going to fall from the pillars. People were shouting all over that 
place. People would get saved and sanctified and full of the Holy 
Ghost—-just like Pentecost. Then [and there] I saw the Holiness 
were right. Those people had something that I didn’t have. 
So at the Cartoogachaye Church of God there was a revival. I 
was sixteen. Howard Speed was the pastor and Clarence Elrod was 
the evangelist. I remember that very well. I was good and saved 
but I knew there was something more for me. It didn’t make any 
difference how long it took—I was going to stay until I got satisfied. 
I didn’t understand the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, didn’t under¬ 
stand the Church of God—didn’t know anything about it. It was 
new to me, but I knew those people had something that I didn’t 
have. I began to seek the Lord that night and I began to pray. 
Some time after midnight—I didn’t know what time it was—I told 
the Lord I was going to stay. It didn’t make any difference to me 
if it took a week. I was so hungry and thirsty after God; I hungered 
after the Holy Ghost so much that I saw the Lord all night long. I 
prayed and I’d get happy and I’d shout and other people stayed 
with me all night. I didn’t know it until it was all over with; they 
told me. When you get real salvation and the Spirit, you lose sight 
of everything worldly. You have to die out with the world and be 
filled with the Spirit. I received the baptism along that morning 
about daybreak. The Lord blessed me and I would get happy and 

============================================================

PENTECOSTALS 
221 
they told me I went all over the church. They’d get me down in 
one place to pray for me and I’d get up and run off] Some of them 
asked the pastor, “Why don’t you pray for him?” 
He said, “I’ll tell you what. If you catch him and hold him, I’ll 
pray for him.” 
I went all over the place. I was shouting and having a good time. 
I’ll never forget that morning; along about daybreak I was laying 
under the bench. I came to myself and I was speaking in a heavenly 
language, an unknown tongue that I had never talked in before. I 
didn’t know what it was all about. I didn’t understand the Holy 
Ghost like I do now. I didn’t understand it but I knew it was some¬ 
thing that I never had before. I knew it was the power of God. 
The Holy Ghost is a gift. A lot of people don’t understand speaking 
in tongues. They condemn it by using a verse of scripture there 
in Corinthians. Paul said, “I’d rather speak five words in my own 
understanding than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue to 
the church.” But he also said that when you’re speaking in an un¬ 
known tongue, you’re not speaking unto man but unto God. When 
you’re speaking in tongues, that’s one language that the devil can’t 
understand. When you’re talking in this heavenly language, direct 
to the Father, the old devil has just got to sit back. He can’t under¬ 
stand a word you’re saying. Because it is a direct line—the devil 
and nobody else knows what you’re saying. 
Also, during that night—let me go back—I argued with the Lord. 
I told Him, “Lord, I’ll do anything but preach.” Because I thought 
about it and I had just a third grade education and I felt I wasn’t 
capable to preach. 
The Lord said, “You obey Me and I’ll give you the Holy Ghost. 
I’ll fill your mouth. Don’t worry about the message or preaching. 
You obey Me and I’ll fill you with the Spirit.” So I obeyed Him. I 
went on home that morning and everything was so wonderful. Well, 
it was like living in a new world. Even the birds sounded sweeter. 
I went home and [at that time] I was helping my dad make acid 
wood to make a living. They were already up. Mother already had 
breakfast on the table. I told Ellen, my sister, “I’ve been telling 
you what those people had and now I’ve got it. I’ve got the Holy 
Ghost.” About that time the power of the Lord fell and I got happy 
and shouted all over that living room and when I got through I 
looked around and my sister wasn’t even there! Scared her. I didn’t 
even eat any breakfast that morning. I didn’t want any. Dad came 
back from the bam where he was feeding the cows and the horses 
and said, “Son, get your ax. We’re going to make acid wood today.” 
I’d stayed up all night long. It didn’t matter to me. I couldn’t have

slept if I had gone to bed anyway. I was so full of the power and 
the Spirit, I couldn’t have slept anyway. So I went on to work that 
day. We’d take an old crosscut saw and cut the logs in two. He’d 
pull the saw one way and I’d pull it the other and tell him about 
what the Lord had done for me and I’ll tell you, that was the sweetest 
day. 
That night Daddy said—I was seventeen and back in those days 
children minded their parents—“Son, you can’t go back to that 
church tonight.” I’d have died if I hadn’t got to go. I said, “Daddy, 
I’ve got to go.” He kept on fussing at me and said for me not to 
go but I got ready and went on. That was the first time I ever 
disobeyed my dad. But I felt that the Lord had given me the Spirit. 
The Lord wanted me to go on and I started out then and began 
to obey and began to go to church. That’s where I got my start. 
Then I went to the army; I was called when I was eighteen. I 
went into the army and stayed twenty-seven months. I stayed nine¬ 
teen months overseas. While I was overseas in Manila every chance 
I would get, I would preach. So over there in the streets of Manila— 
that city was tore all to pieces when we went into it—I’d have street 
service. People would gather around and we would have a time. I 
never will forget—-one day we were standing by an old building 
and I didn’t know it was a Catholic church and the Father came 
out and he said, “You’re going to have to leave. This is our prop¬ 
erty.” While I was next to their church, there were boys fighting 
on the other side of the street. I didn’t argue with him, I just walked 
across the street to where those boys were and kept on preaching. 
The fight stopped and they all scattered and some of them came 
to listen to me. 
Back when we first started out, they would throw rotten eggs at 
people in the [Holiness] churches and break windows and shout 
at them. Let me tell you a little experience I had when I pastored 
my first church at Tessentee. That was the first church I pastored. 
We started in a home, a lady’s house. The crowds got so big we 
had to get a tent and pitch it outside. That’s where the church 
got started. During our revival, people fought the Holiness. They 
were going to see that the Church of God wasn’t going to get in 
that community. So we were in this good revival and we were going 
to have a homecoming on a Sunday. I never will forget it; me and 
the evangelist were out in the yard and we were working on the 
tables and the deputy sheriff came up. They came up in the yard 
and wanted to know who we were. I introduced myself and they 
knew who [the evangelist] was. 
He said, “We got warrants here to serve on you and the preacher. 

============================================================
PAGE 225

PENTECOSTALS 
223 
The community got you for disturbance and they want you to close 
this revival out. If you don’t close it out, I’m going to have to take 
you in.” 
The evangelist said, ‘‘All right, I’ll tell you when we’re going to 
close this revival out. When God says quit, we’ll quit.” 
They stood around a few minutes and went on into town and 
that was the last we heard of them. They must have had the trans¬ 
former because they threw the lights out on us—we didn’t have 
any lights. So we just turned the cars and made lights and had 
service all the night. We had the power company to turn them back 
on the next day. That wouldn’t stop us so the preacher’s car was 
sitting beside the road and while we were preaching, they pushed 
his car off the side of the road into a potato patch. They were that 
much against us. We found out that the ones complaining and the 
ones that took the warrant out lived three miles [from where we 
• were]. 
We have many Holiness movements that are not a part of the 
Church of God [as I know it, and all of this confuses people]. Our 
Church of God doesn’t believe in handling snakes. It’s more of a 
put on of a show because the Lord said, “Thou shall not tempt 
the Lord thy God.” That’s just like going across a freeway and just 
throwing yourself in front of a big truck. You’ve got more sense 
than that. You’ve got more sense than to take up a poisonous snake. 
So that’s the differences. 
There are a lot of good things we believe in. We believe in foot 
washings. Most of the Church of God churches have them every 
quarter but you can have them as often as you want. We believe 
in the Lord’s Supper and foot washings. Men washes brothers’ feet 
and sister washes sisters’ feet. 
We believe in Divine healing. I’ve known of people getting healed. 
I’ve prayed for a lot of people. Do you know Granny Eller? She 
got cataracts on her eyes. And we prayed for her here the other 
night and they disappeared before long. She went back to the eye 
doctor and the eye doctor wanted to know what had happened to 
her. She’s up in her eighties and now she’s getting so she can see 
better. It’s a miracle work of God. You have to have faith in God. 
[When I came into the Holiness way] I was just a different person. 
The Bible says that you become a new creature in Christ; old things 
are passed away. I was washed clean and purified and the Spirit 
dwelled within me. It’s hard to explain the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
You’ve got to b& sincere and really want this.

CHARLES LEE, Fire Baptized Holiness Church 
We found Reverend Charles Lee’s church before we found Charles Lee. 
While riding on back roads in the far northwest mountainous reaches of South 
Carolina we passed a sturdy-looking church with a sign in the grassy front 
yard that proclaimed, “Fire-Baptized Holiness Church. ” Since we had never 
heard of this branch of the Pentecostal church, our curiosity was greatly aroused 
and we began stopping at nearby houses in search of someone who could 
discuss and elaborate on Fire Baptized Holiness beliefs. At the second house, 
an elderly lady told us about Reverend Charles Lee and gave us directions 
to his home. 
After Reverend Lee learned of our study, he was glad to answer our inquiries 
concerning his beliefs. And even though he represents one of the lesser known 
groups within the Pentecostal movement, our interview with him, and our 
attendance at one of his church services, made us understand the important 
and significant theology of the Fire Baptized Holiness. Since we began our 
friendship with Reverend Lee, we have noticed more of these particular churches 
coming into being in our area. 
Reverend Lee speaks for a church that holds to conservative beliefs and 
traditions. A Fire-Baptized Holiness preacher since 1952, he now discusses 
the principles held dear by him and his denomination.

[When I got saved about 25 years ago] it was just true conviction 
of the Lord and His working upon my life and calling me. Just 
like anybody else getting converted and being saved. I got saved 
when I was in the Navy and then I received sanctification about 
two or three weeks later. Then in about two more weeks, I was 
baptized with the Holy Ghost. I received the call to preach on a 
Thursday night [after] I was converted on a Sunday night. 
When I was just a child, I went to Holiness meetings and I knew 
that God had His hand upon my life but I didn’t know I was going 
to be called to preach. I didn’t know that because nobody knows 
the future. But whenever I got saved and then began to mend my 
ways and seeking the Lord and praying, why, the Lord began to 
open up the way. I knew that it was God’s will that I preach. I 
just knew it. 
I knew when the Lord was dealing with me. I was laying on my 
bed that night and I couldn’t sleep. My mind was troubled. I knew 
something was wrong. I was praying and meditating to myself. Not 
out loud, you know. No emotional fit. I was just laying there praying, 
talking with the Lord. The presence of the Lord was great and I 
knew it was He. The Spirit of God moved in my mind. Well, I felt 
like the Lord had something for me to do, but I didn’t know what 
it was. I was troubled. Like I say, I couldn’t sleep another half minute 
in that condition. 
[When I first recognized the call to preach,] I just didn’t feel 
like I could do it. Just like Moses, you know. When the Lord called 
Moses, [Moses] said, “I’m slow of speech. I can’t do it.” The Lord 
says, “I’ll give you a spokesman.” The Lord gave him Aaron [Moses’ 
brother] to speak for him because he was a much better talker than 
Moses was. Well, I felt like I couldn’t do it. And I knew it was 
God dealing with me and I knew I’d better do it. I didn’t know at 
the time the Bible says that the gifts and a calling of God are without 
repentance. God calls a man to preach, there’s no way of getting 
around it. It’s got to be done if you please God. You don’t have 
to, but you could be lost—go to hell [if you refuse it]. [I felt I 
couldn’t do it because] I’m a nervous-like fellow, always have been 
a little bit nervous and hurried up, but yet, the power of God, the 
Holy Ghost, gives a man boldness, you see. I told the Lord I would 
preach. I accepted it and I went to sleep just like that [he snaps 
his fingers], instantly. 
When the Lord called me to preach, it seemed like the Bible 
came before me and the pages were being turned like something 
coming off a press. Just like a newspaper coming off a press. I saw 
later on that when I was preaching the pages of the Bible would

be in my mind and they turned like [they did in my vision] because 
I preach fast. I can’t preach no other way except fast. You’ve seen 
some people that can just talk and rattle it off with no trouble at 
all? When I get to preaching, why, it just comes to me. 
Where did the name “Pentecostal Fire Baptized” come from? 
In the book of John’s writing, we find where John the Baptist 
came preaching in the wilderness saying, “repent ye, the kingdom 
of heaven is at hand.” Well, he went on to say that Christ, the 
Messiah, would come and He did. Then the Law was fulfilled. John 
went on to tell the people, “I’m not the Christ. He that cometh 
after me is mightier than me,” says, “He shall”—shall, you know 
what shall is? He will do it, you see. It can be done; it will be done. 
That’s the way you use shall. Well, he said, “He shall baptize you 
with the Holy Ghost and with fire.” Well, you see, they took the 
name “fire” and “Pentecostal” because we believe in Pentecost like 
in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Pentecostal Fire Baptized— 
that’s what it means: “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost 
and with fire.” 
When [Christ] baptizes you, you’ll know you’re baptized. When 
you repent, you become as a little child. The Bible says—3:3 of 
John says—“verily, verily I say unto thee, except you be converted 
and become as a little child, you cannot see the kingdom of God 
or enter heaven.” When you’re bom again, that’s repentance. You’re 
on a level with God as a little babe then. You’re forgiven of your 
actual transgressions of sin which man commits. 
Sin is in a two-fold manner. The Bible speaks about it as the 
Adam nature. Sin, man inherited from his forefathers because that 
nature is in a man. That’s what causes a little child to lie to his 
parents. He’s got the Adam nature in there. You take your child 
or anybody’s and you tell it not to do this and not to do that— 
you’ve got to watch a child. That sinful nature is there. “Adam’s 
sin” we call it. Man failed back there in the Garden of Eden at 
Creation. He transgressed the Law of God. He fell from a holy 
state which he was created in. When man was made there wasn’t 
anything wrong with him. He was perfect because the Bible says 
everything God created was good. There wasn’t any flaws in him. 
Adam and Eve sinned there in the garden and transgressed the 
Laws of God willfully—willfully because God told them not to. When 
you repent, you ask God to forgive you of your sins. All right, you’re 
bom again. You pray. The Spirit of God is renewed in you. 
We teach [conversion and sanctification] as the two works of grace 
and the Baptism of the Holy Ghost as a gift of God, a promise of 

============================================================
PAGE 229
============================================================

PENTECOSTALS 
227 
God which Christ promised to His disciples. Speaking in tongues 
is a sign of the evidence that you have received and been baptized 
by the Holy Ghost—that’s the initial evidence that you know you’ve 
got the Holy Ghost. We teach sanctification as the second definite 
work of grace. It is, like I say, a work for you to do yourself, on 
your part and then as you continually grow in the grace and knowl¬ 
edge of the Lord Jesus Christ after your conversion, you can be 
sanctified. By appropriating faith and grace in your heart, God can 
sanctify you as a second definite work in a moment like that [he 
snaps his fingers]. You know about it when you’re sanctified just 
as much as you knew about it when you got converted. 
How is the Pentecostal Fire Baptized Holiness Church different from other 
Pentecostal churches? 
Basically our Bible preaching of doctrine would be the same thing 
as the Pentecostal people because they believe in regeneration, sanc¬ 
tification, Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and Divine healing. All these 
Holiness movements teach that. Basically, the fundamental teaching 
is the same thing, but the government is different in our church. 
I’ll tell you when the body was organized as a group of people. 
It was in 1919, November 21. These two churches, the Free Will 
Baptist and this body of preachers that already called themselves 
Pentecostal Fire Baptized preachers because they preached the Holy 
Ghost, they got together over here in Georgia as a group of preachers 
and formed the church conference. [They] organized and got to¬ 
gether and fellowshipped and made a covenant and that’s why we’re 
named the Pentecostal Fire Baptized Holiness church. 
[Our conference includes churches in] four states: North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. We’ve got one church in 
Virginia and it’s kind of in our conference. 
What services other than morning worship do you hold? 
We have revivals, camp meetings, and watch night service. [Watch 
night service is] the last day of the year and we stay [at the church] 
until the New Year comes in. We sing, pray, and preach and invite 
other people in. 
We had a homecoming the first Sunday in June. [At homecoming] 
we have regular services or invite a former preacher in or someone 
to preach for us that day. Then we have dinner on the grounds. 
People come in from other churches and we eat together. After 
that, we sit around, clean up, go back in the church and start singing. 
Just let the Lord have His way. 
They have some [special] singings sometimes. People come in 

============================================================
PAGE 230
============================================================

228 FOXFIRE 7 
from other churches and sing. We just invite the people in that 
wants to come. 
We believe in feet washing. [The service is] not necessarily regular, 
like on a schedule. Somebody suggests that we haven’t had a foot 
washing in some time and that we ought to have a communion 
service and foot washing. We have foot washing when we have the 
communion. 
Have you seen any people healed? 
I’ve been healed. I went to the doctor and was told I needed 
surgery but I was prayed for the Lord healed me. I know some 
people that’s been healed of different things but I’ve never personally 
seen too much of such instantaneous things like [are] in the Bible. 
I’ve never seen too many healings but I know healing’s real and a 
man’s got a right to believe in Divine healing and trust God for 
the healing of his body and not to have to take any medicine. He 
might suffer some things. The Lord don’t do everything that you 
want done right away but He does heal. Healing’s real. You can’t 
explain it but you can know it when you get healed and you can 
receive it. 
A lot of these people are preaching Divine healing today and 
commercializing it, sort of speaking, making money off the Gospel. 
A man ought not to make money off the Gospel. He ought to preach 
it free. He ought to give it willingly. He ought not use it commercially 
like some of these preachers are preaching across the land today; 
telling people that they got so much power and they got this, that, 
and the other. Well, certainly some people’s got power. We don’t 
deny people having power with God. But still, they ain’t got that 
much power. They just can’t heal everybody, because they’re doing 
it more or less for the gain. That’s the way they’re deceiving the 
people. The Bible says “this know also, that in the last days many 
false prophets would arise and deceive many and deceive the very 
elect if possible.” Christ said “go not near, have nothing to do 
with it.” There’s people claiming that they got more grace than 
anybody’s got. But God’s not limited to no person; it’s for whosoever 
will. You’ve got just as much right to call upon the Son as I have— 
anybody has, whoever they are, because they’re human beings and 
that’s all. 
We believe in people living right to get to heaven. That’s the 
purpose of preaching the Gospel—not to just have a place of enter¬ 
tainment. [Church] is to be lightly taken. It’s to be really considered 
as a work of God. Churches today, why, they have these fellowship 

============================================================

PENTECOSTALS 
229 
homes and they have all kinds of get-togethers and things. Churches 
are doing just like the schools are doing—for the entertainment 
of the people. We believe in getting the presence of the Lord there 
and having the power of God in our midst and the Lord a’working, 
because, without that, you can have ten thousand or a hundred 
thousand people gathered together like in a ball game and the Lord 
not be in the midst. 
Did they ever “church ” people in the Pentecostal Fire Baptized Holiness 
Church ? 
They have “church cleanings” they call it. People come before 
the church like Matthew tells us. People fall out with one another. 
They can’t get along. Somebody teaches something or other that’s 
contrary to our teaching, you see. They call in the boards and get 
together and decide upon it and go talk to the person and ask them 
. the trouble and try to settle it within themselves. If they can’t, then 
they have a church meeting. 
Here’re the general rules: “No person shall be admitted unto 
the full fellowship of this church who is not in full accord with 
the teaching of the same. He must give satisfactory evidence, aside 
from his own testimony, that he is regenerated, groaning to be sancti¬ 
fied, and seeking the Pentecostal Baptism of the Holy Ghost. In 
accord with these professions all who remain with us take as their 
rule of conduct the Word of God and shall conform outwardly as 
well as inwardly in their daily walk and conversation to its simple 
teachings (Galations 6:16). We are commanded in God’s Word not 
to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers and to have no 
communion or fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness such 
as oath-bound secret societies, labor unions, social clubs, corrupt 
partisans, and politics (II Corinthians 6:14, Ephesians 5:11). Be not 
conformed to this world (Romans 12:2), but come out from among 
them and be ye separate (II Corinthians 6:17). He will turn away 
from those who are the form of Godliness but deny the power (II 
Timothy 3:15). To cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh 
and Spirit (II Corinthians 27:1) such as use, growth, and sale of 
any tobacco of any form, use of morphine or intoxicants,” Coca 
Colas and things like that. This does not apply to minors who are 
forced to do so by their parents in obedience to them; wives who 
are forced to do so by their husbands. “Foolish talking, jesting, 
use of slang language [is forbidden]. Abstain from the appearance 
of all evil such as attending fairs, swimming pools, shows of any 
kind, including television.” We deem it a violation of these rules 

============================================================
PAGE 232

230 
FOXFIRE 7 
for a member of our church who is the head of the house to allow 
a television to operate in his home. If they break these rules we 
feel like they’re not in harmony with our teaching, so they might 
turn somebody out of church [for breaking them]. 
Most of the Fire Baptized Holiness still don’t go to shows and ball games? 
That’s right. We don’t go to ball games. I used to be a great 
football fan. I never went to baseball much but I loved football. I 
have not been to a football game in twenty-five years. 
I have never owned a television. I have never bought one. I remem¬ 
ber when television was invented. The first one I ever saw was in 
New York City in a bar in 1948. They just had come out and there 
weren’t any down here in the South. They didn’t come out till about 
1951 down here. When television came out only places like that 
bar could afford one at that time. 
[Some of the church members are less strict now.] They used 
to not go to [movies] but now they got television in their homes. 
Well, that’s the same thing; it’s just an improvement of picture shows. 
That’s all a television is. They show a lot of pictures and movies 
over television. Nobody can’t tell me about television because I know 
when they first came out. And I know they’re evil. Even the govern¬ 
ment says that they’re defiling and harmful and that they’re warping 
up people’s minds. Education is good, but it’s not going to make 
the world better. It’s good for people to have some education—I 
haven’t got much—but it’s destroying our human race and our coun¬ 
try as far as the morals and everything’s concerned. It’s destroying 
our people. Just like ball games and things. It’s all right for children 
to get out here and play ball but when they get out here and try 
to take one school against another—they get out there and this 
fellow, he’s “booing” for this and the other fellow’s “ahing” for 
this and they get in fights. 
[But the church is] still pretty much the same. [Our rules for 
living are still strict and] that’s the reason why you won’t have as 
many people [in the Pentecostal Fire Baptized Holiness Church]. 
There ain’t many people willing to abide by it. That’s why we don’t 
have [a large membership] and that’s why we’ve had [splits within 
the church] over the years. At the end of World War II, about 1945, 
they had approximately seventy-two churches throughout the four 
states but now we have thirty-five churches. 
Do members still dress conservatively ? 
We don’t go indecently exposed and put on display like the world 
does. We don’t believe in wearing shorts, halters, and pants for 

============================================================

231 
women. People didn t used to do that twenty-five to thirty years 
ago. You d see a few people [in shorts, for example] around the 
house, but they wouldn’t do it [in public] then; but now people’s 
going nearly nude. That’s contrary [to our beliefs]. Of course, it’s 
people that s not Christians. Some may be claiming to be Christians 
but they’re deceived. 
The high school had this ruling—they said it was required of all 
people to take physical education. [My daughter] refused it, she 
didn t take it. She wouldn’t put on a pair of shorts. They wouldn’t 
give her a diploma because they said it wouldn’t be right. Well, 
they discriminated against her, see. She had a B average and twenty- 
one units and only eighteen was required but they didn’t give her 
a diploma. They only gave her a certificate. 
Holiness people were really persecuted years ago. People used 
to take tents out to preach and maybe they’d cut the ropes and 
things on the tents. I could take you to people that really don’t 
like Holiness today. They’re church people but they don’t like Holi¬ 
ness in no form, no fashion. I know some of them personally. But 
as for me, there ain’t nobody harmed me or nothing. I know older 
preachers [who were persecuted]. There’s one fellow [whose life 
was] threatened back years ago. I knew him. He’s dead now. They 
used to throw eggs and things at people walking down the road 
and people going to church. People didn’t like them. They’d call 
them “old holy rollers” and things like that. I know that to be a 
fact. 
To be a Christian, you’ve got to do different from the way the 
world does. In this “are the children of God manifested from the 
children of the devil.” Now, somebody’s serving the devil. Some¬ 
body’s living in sin. If they weren’t, why, there wouldn’t anybody 
be lost. Everybody’s not going to be converted. No sir. People are 
preaching that this old world’s getting better all the time; it’s not 
getting better, it’s getting worse all the time. 
People don’t believe the Word of God; they’ll turn deaf ears and 
turn away from the truth. They say, “No, it don’t take [faith and 
dedication]. You’re wrong; you’re a fanatic.” They say, “No sir, 
preacher, I’ll do what I want to. I can do as I please.” That’s what 
the world’ll tell you. Anybody’ll tell you about it, especially if they’ve 
not made a decision to follow God. People are bickering, they’re 
growling, they’re not content, they’re not satisfied. As much as we 
have today. When I was a child, I didn’t know what living in a brick 
house was. I can remember walking five and six miles to church. 
Now you can’t get folks out in an air-conditioned automobile [to 
come to church]. They want to go for a ride on Sundays; they want 

============================================================
PAGE 234
============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
232 
to get their boat. They’re going to do what they want to do. They’re 
a servant of sin. Look at how they dress. We’re [supposed] to pattern 
our life after Christ. 
The world’s not being converted today. There’s a few folks getting 
saved but there’s not many folks getting religion—the kind that’s 
pure and undefiled, like the Bible says. You get out here and you 
look at people. You go into town and look at the people and see 
how they’re living. Well, they’re ungodly. They haven’t repented 
and been born again. They’re not serving God; they’re serving the 
flesh. According to the Bible, if you live and serve the flesh, ye 
shall die. The Bible says “for the wages of sin is death, but the 
gift of God is eternal life with Christ Jesus.” 
Everybody believes in God, or tells you that they do, but they 
don’t believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He is great and His 
power is sufficient to cleanse them up and keep a man from sinning. 
Some people don’t preach it. They say, “Oh, you’ve got to sin a 
little all the time. You can’t help but sin.” But [he reads] here it 
says, “He that committeth sin is of the devil.” “Whosoever,” listen 
to this, “is born of God doth not commit sin.” Now, that’s the 
Word of God. It’s in there. If you’re doing the will of God, you 
wouldn’t want to do wrong; you don’t want to commit any evil. 
No vile will come out of a man’s mouth. You can’t be a Christian 
and use profanity at the same time. If a man uses profanity, there’s 
something wrong with him. He’s not got the grace of God. That’s 
why we say you’ve got to be sanctified because when you get sancti¬ 
fied it cleanses a man up and puts love in his heart for God.

Presbyterians 
All people that on earth do dwell, 
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice; 
Him serve with fear, His praise forth-tell; 
Come ye before Him and rejoice. 
For why? The Lord our God is good, 
His mercy is forever sure: 
His truth at all times firmly stood, 
and shall from age to age endure. 
(Old Hundredth, Genevan Psalter) 
Three Presbyterian ministers are presented in this, the last section 
on mountain denominations. L. B. Gibbs, who came to Rabun 
County in 1926, rode a circuit, ministering to a number of churches. 
He has preached in several southern states and remains active in 
church affairs. Clyde Hicks presently rides a circuit consisting of 
several churches, continuing a tradition long existent in local reli¬ 
gious history; Sid McCarty, advocate of interdenominational cooper¬ 
ation, also supports the Charismatic movement, a new phenomenon 
he discusses in this chapter. 
Presbyterians would not typically come to mind when discussing 
“mountain religion.” Characteristically, they do not handle snakes, 
conduct foot washings, or hold lengthy revivals; and their orderly 
services are usually run by well-educated ministers. Presbyterians 
were, however, among the first to come into the mountains, and 
their influence has been far reaching. Therefore any religious study 
such as ours, without inclusion of this denomination, would be in¬ 
complete.

L. B. GIBBS, Presbyterian 
Reverend Leonard Bums (L. B.) Gibbs is an obvious and logical spokesper¬ 
son for the philosophy and theology of the Presbyterian denomination. Reverend 
Gibbs was born into a Presbyterian family on November 20, 1901, in Jackson 
County, Georgia, the son of Leonard Hamilton Gibbs, a farmer, dairyman, 
and orchardist, and Minnie Elizabeth Bums Gibbs. In 1912, he became a 
member of the Presbyterian Church and later, upon completion of his theological 
studies, was ordained and became a member of the Presbyteries of the Presbyte¬ 
rian Church of the United States. Reverend Gibbs has contributed greatly to 
his community and is respected by both young and old, Presbyterians and 
those of other denominations. His record of church ministry is indeed impressive 
as he has served a number of churches in the mountains of Tennessee, Virginia, 
and Georgia. Two extensive interviews were done with Reverend Gibbs and 
we found that he was always ready to carefully, patiently, and intelligently 
answer our inquiries.

I became a member of the church when I was about eleven years 
old. I couldn’t tell you the exact date of my conversion. There are 
a great many people who are unquestionably born again and are 
believers in Christ who can’t put their finger on any certain day. 
If they grew up in a Christian home where they were taught about

the Bible from childhood, a lot of times it is more difficult for them 
to put their finger on a date, and that’s my case. I can’t, but I did 
become a member of the church when I was about eleven. 
I first came to Rabun County [Georgia] over fifty years ago at 
the end of my first year in seminary, expecting to spend the summer. 
Instead, I stayed twelve months and after that, I was back in school 
again for two years. In 1929, I married and we came to Tiger to 
live and were there for eight years, then we moved away. We came 
back again in ’49 and lived here until ’56 when I was pastor of 
the Presbyterian churches in the county, including Rabun Gap [Pres¬ 
byterian Church] both times because we had only one ordained 
minister in the county at that time. A little over six years ago I 
retired, and we came back here to live. I’m still preaching as a supply 
[minister] in two of our churches, at Tiger and Wiley. So altogether, 
I have twenty-two years in Rabun County stretching over a period 
of fifty years. 
Were your folks Presbyterian ? 
Yes. Both my father and mother were Presbyterians. I grew up 
in Habersham County [Georgia] and was a member of the Cornelia 
Presbyterian Church until I was ordained in 1929, when I became 
a member of the Presbytery. In the Presbyterian church, a minister 
is not a member of the local church but belongs to the Presbytery, 
which is the area organization. 
How did you feel you were called into the ministry? 
I never had any audible voice tell me that I ought to go into 
the ministry or any blinding vision or anything like that, but I felt 
that that was the place where I ought to work. I came to a very 
definite decision about that. There were a good many other things 
that I thought of as a boy when I was growing up, as most boys 
do, I think. But I came to the conclusion that the ministry was the 
place where the Lord wanted me to be. I think that’s why I’m here. 
How were the Presbyterians accepted when they first came into the county? 
When I came, there had been Presbyterian work going on here 
for five years, so it was not absolutely new. But generally, I think 
the church was cordially received. There was some feeling on the 
part of some people, I think, against our branch of the church, 
perhaps; but, generally, I believe there was a good spirit in the 
county. 

============================================================

236 
Could you explain about your circuit preaching? 
Let me go back to the time when I first came to Rabun County 
in 1926. Our work in the county was very new then. There had 
been a minister here for five years, and he had just moved away. 
The Tiger church was the first one to be organized and then Wiley 
and the Boiling Springs Church in Persimmon, the name of which 
was later changed to King Memorial. So when I came in 1926, we 
had those three organized churches. We had a preaching point in 
the Timpson community out west of Clayton and one on Betty’s 
Creek. In both of those places we were using the school building 
at that time as a building for our services. I would usually have a 
service in the morning and a service in the afternoon, and maybe 
another service at night in order to get around. Of course, I was 
not able to get around to every church every Sunday in those days. 
Our church at Rabun Gap was organized in 1929, after the Nacoo- 
chee and Rabun Gap schools were merged, and I became the pastor 
of that church as well as the others. In the early fifties, the Clayton 
church was organized and the Timpson group, where we had a 
preaching point, was organized during the fifties. So that made six 
churches in the county altogether, which is what we have now. 
What one main point distinguishes the Presbyterian doctrine from the doctrines 
of various other churches ? 
The Presbyterian Church holds to what is known as the Calvinistic 
interpretation of the Bible, which gets its name from John Calvin, 
who lived during the time of the Protestant Reformation. He syste¬ 
matized a statement of the teachings of the Bible as he understood 
them. He didn’t invent it, I believe, but he did make a systematic 
statement. It goes back to St. Augustine, who lived in the fourth 
century and, I think, to the Apostle Paul in the first century. I believe 
that Calvin gives us a good and dependable statement of the Bible’s 
teachings, and his system of doctrine is centered around the great 
truth of the sovereignty of God, God’s right and God’s power to 
do whatever’s good in His sight. If you start with that, the other 
things fit around it. So that would be the central theme of the Calvin¬ 
istic understanding of the Bible. 
Have Presbyterians veered away from that one idea much during recent years ? 
There are people in the Presbyterian Church who interpret it 
more liberally now, I think, than they did, say, a few decades ago. 
Officially we still hold to what is known as the Westminster Confes¬ 
sion of Faith, which was formulated by the Westminster Assembly 
in England in the seventeenth century. That was adopted by the 

============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS 
237 
Presbyterian churches of the world as their statement of Bible teach¬ 
ings. We do not require of members of the church an acceptance 
of the Calvinistic understanding of the Bible. This, really, is required 
of ministers and officers in the church. A man is examined as to 
his knowledge of this system of doctrine and his acceptance of it 
before he is ordained to the ministry by the Presbytery, or before 
he is ordained as an elder or deacon in the local church. There is, 
on some points, some latitude of interpretation, but an acceptance 
of the system is required of men who are ordained to the ministry. 
I use the word “men,” actually, now in our church, women can 
be, and some are, ordained to the ministry and the diaconate and 
the eldership, but the far greater majority of church officers are 
still men. We require of people who come into the church only an 
acceptance of Jesus Christ as their Savior, and their profession of 
their willingness to live for Him in the church. 
Where does the word Presbyterian come from? 
It comes from the Greek word “presbutoros” which is the word 
for elder in the Greek language. We find elders in the churches in 
the New Testament under the leadership of the apostles. They chose 
elders in the churches. That word is brought almost bodily from 
the Greek over into the English language with just slight changes. 
Has the government within the church changed? 
Basically, it is still the same. There may not be as close oversight 
of the local congregation, in a great many cases, as there used to 
be, but the organization is the same. The Presbyterian church is a 
church governed by elders. It gets its name from that fact, not from 
the fact that it holds to the Calvinistic system of doctrine. The minis¬ 
ter is a teaching elder and the other elders in the local church are 
called ruling elders. The minister also has a share in the government 
of the church, and the ruling elders have a share in the teaching 
of the church, but they’re named as they are from the predominance 
of their responsibility. The elders of the local church are organized 
into what is known as the session. The pastor, when he is installed 
as pastor, becomes moderator of the session by virtue of being the 
pastor of the church, and the ruling elders are all members of the 
session. Now that body has the oversight of the whole life and pro¬ 
gram of the local church. Then there are deacons in a great many 
of our churches, not in all of them. Many of them get along without 
a deacon. The deacons exercise a spiritual ministry, but [they also] 
have to do with the material side of the churches’ life: the offerings, 
their collection and their distribution; the propertv of the church;

the buildings and grounds; looking after the poor, and so forth. 
So those are the officers in the church. 
We believe in the organic unity of the church as a whole, and 
so the local church is a part of the presbytery, which is an area 
organization. When the presbytery meets, it is made up of the minis¬ 
ters who serve the churches in that area or who are serving in some 
other capacity, maybe as a teacher in a school. All the ministers 
who belong to that presbytery and a ruling elder from each church 
of the presbytery together constitute the presbytery. It convenes 
to carry on the work for the area and the oversight of the churches 
that are in that area. Two or more presbyteries make up a synod, 
which is a larger area. Here, we belong to the Synod of the Southeast, 
which is comprised of Georgia and South Carolina. The highest 
body is the General Assembly of the Church, which includes repre¬ 
sentatives from all the presbyteries within the church. 
Are the churches here in the same presbytery now that they've always been 
in? 
It has been the same for quite a good many years. There are 
seventeen counties here in Northeast Georgia [included in] the Ath¬ 
ens Presbytery. Many years ago the boundaries were changed some¬ 
times, maybe a county was added on or cut off and put over in 
another presbytery, but it has been the same now for quite a number 
of years. Any churches of our branch of the church are organized 
within that area belonging to the Athens Presbytery. 
Do emotions play a large part of people worshipping within the church? 
Generally speaking, the Presbyterian church in its services is less 
emotional than some other branches of the church. I believe that 
has been true all down through the history of the church. But that 
does not mean that we do not recognize the emotions as a valid 
part of a person’s makeup. The gospel is an appeal to the emotions 
as well as to the intellect, but generally, the Presbyterian church 
has stressed less the emotional side than some other branches of 
the church have. I have not seen a great change, I think, in the 
churches where I have ministered in that respect during these fifty 
years. 
Do you think there has been spiritual change ? 
As far as my experience goes, it has been largely the same. There 
are times in local churches when there are deep spiritual movements, 
maybe a revival meeting may stimulate the emotions of people, but 

============================================================
PAGE 241
============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS 
239 
on the whole course of the life of the church, I think it has remained 
pretty much the same. 
Are Mere any differences between the old church and the new church ? 
I could mention two or three things. One is the change in the 
position of the church in regard to the ordination of women. That 
is only a fairly recent thing, several years ago, but recent as the 
history of the church goes. The church adopted this stand: First, 
that women could be ordained to the office of elder and deacon; 
and then to the office of the ministry. (I think it was later. I’m not 
sure. It could all have been done at the same time.) There are not 
a great many women ministers in our church. There are more elders 
and deacons who are women. That has been one change. 
I think that there is, in some places, more laxity in these days 
in the interpretation of the Bible. [There may be more laxity] in 
the application of the Bible to daily living than there used to be, 
but I’m not sure that I could say that that was general. So, I have 
not seen any tremendous changes, I think, in that respect. More 
liberality, perhaps, in the interpretation of the Bible now than there 
was fifty years ago, but still [there are] a great many conservative 
ministers in the church and conservatism within the local churches, 
too. 
What is the physical structure of a typical church ? 
I don’t know that there was any characteristic type of structure 
that marked the Presbyterian church as different from others. Of 
course, years ago, many of the churches were only a single room, 
usually, pretty squarely built, and they had no Sunday school rooms. 
In the church where I grew up at Cornelia [Georgia] when I was 
a boy, we had no separate rooms cut off; the classes just met at 
different spots around in the sanctuary. It has been characteristic 
of Presbyterian churches in this general area, that we have had the 
pulpit in the center rather than on one side. Some branches of 
the church, for example the Episcopal church, will usually have a 
lectern on one side from which the Scripture is read and the pulpit 
on the other side where the minister goes to preach his sermon. 
There are some Presbyterian churches that are doing that in recent 
times, but the older ones had the pulpit in the center, which, I 
think, is characteristic of the church’s putting the Bible in the central 
place in the life of the church. They typified that by the position 
of the pulpit. There was really no characteristic type of architecture, 
I think, that would mark the Presbyterian church as different from 
others.

How did the congregations pay their ministers years ago ? 
When I first came to Rabun County, the churches were very young. 
The Tiger church was organized in 1922. The minister had come 
there to live in 1921. The Wiley church was organized in 1924. 
Those churches were small in membership and money was not plen¬ 
tiful. There was little economic opportunity in the county, almost 
no industry at all, you could say practically none, so it was difficult 
for the people to make a living. The Presbytery and the Synod paid 
the greater part of the minister’s salary; the churches paid only a 
very small part of it back in those days. This was considered home 
mission work, so most of the support for a minister came from 
the outside. Now in the years that have passed since then, industry 
has come into the county; there’s employment for everybody who 
wants employment, and the churches have benefited from the fact 
that the people have more money. So now, the people in the churches 
give much more liberally than they used to and the churches are 
able to carry a greater share of the support of the minister. The 
Presbytery still assists in the support of the ministers in some of 
our churches in Rabun County, but there has been a tremendous 
change in that respect. 
Do you think that congregations were more dedicated years ago ? 
I believe that the attendance in most of our churches was better 
years ago than it is now, but I’m not too sure that that means any 
less dedication of the part of the people who do come now. You 
see, fifty years ago the roads in the county were very poor, few 
people had automobiles, there was no television, there were very 
few radios, and I think, then perhaps, some people went to church 
because that was the only place to go. There was little competition. 
They’d gather there with the rest of the community and see their 
neighbors and friends there. Today, there’s so much more competi¬ 
tion. It’s easy, for example, for people to get in their car and go 
to Six Flags [an amusement park near Atlanta] if they want to; or 
they can stay at home and listen to services on television with a 
more eloquent preacher than they’ll hear in their own church and 
better music than they’ll hear in their own church, in most cases. 
So, I think that those things have seemed to cut down on church 
attendance, but I believe that in all our churches there are faithful, 
dedicated people who are there because they want to be there to 
worship on Sunday morning and who are not distracted by these 
diversions that have come in.

Did the churches prepare for holidays ? 
I can remember that back in my boyhood in the church where I 
grew up, the Sunday school would have a Christmas tree. I remember 
that distinctly from my early childhood. I don’t believe the emphasis 
was placed on Christmas in the services of the church as much then 
as it is now, or on Easter, either; but in our churches here in Rabun 
County since the early days of our work here, we have had special 
things at Christmastime and we have come to give more attention 
to Easter in recent years. Some say that those are pagan holidays 
that have been brought into the church, but it is a time when, without 
being pagan, we can think especially of the Lord’s coming into hu¬ 
man life in the birth of Christ and of the resurrection and the mean¬ 
ing of the resurrection. We do try to emphasize those things at 
those seasons. 
Were there any other special services, such as watch night? 
Not generally. As far as I can recall, we have not had any watch 
night services, for example, in the Presbyterian churches here in 
our county. I don’t remember them from the days when I was grow- 
ing up in the church. I don’t think those are without their use at 
all. I think they may be very useful services, but our people have 
just not gone in for that kind of service, really. 
In most of our churches in the county, we have had, from time 
to time, evangelistic services or revival services, special efforts to 
bring people to an acceptance of Christ as Savior and to come into 
the membership of the church, and to strengthen the lives of those 
who are already in the church; but those, with Easter and Christmas 
and daily vacation Bible schools in the summer, have been our 
stronger points in regard to special services. 
We’ve had Bible schools in the county for many years. One change 
that I have noticed there is that when we lived here, for example, 
in the thirties, we always had young women to come in from the 
outside to help us in our Bible schools. They did most of the teach¬ 
ing, along with the pastor, himself. There were quite a number of 
college students who came to us from Florida State College for 
Women, year by year and some of them have had a continued interest 
in the work in Rabun County. Now, the people who have grown 
up in the church take the leadership and go ahead with those schools. 
Did the Presbyterians ever have homecomings ? 
We have had those from time to time. I remember particularly, 
the King Memorial Church in Persimmon has had such services. I 
don’t recall a homecoming service in any of our other churches in 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
the county. There may have been some but I just don’t remember 
any of them. [At homecoming] there would be a worship service 
with a sermon in the morning and dinner at the church, and, maybe 
in the afternoon, singing. 
One thing that the Tiger church particularly has done is to work 
with the other two churches in the community, the Baptist and the 
Methodist church, in some union services. There was a time years 
ago, where we had union evangelistic meetings. We’d have a minister 
from the outside invited or maybe the three pastors would just 
preach in rotation in those meetings, which would be held in one 
or the other of those churches. Now at Tiger we have a union service 
every fifth Sunday, which comes once a quarter, and we rotate among 
the three churches. Sometimes, one of the pastors preaches; some¬ 
times we have an outside minister to come in and preach. Once a 
year at that union service, the one that occurs in the summer, there 
will be a dinner at the church, but we do that only one time a 
year. That gives a good spirit of cooperation among the churches 
in the community. For four years now we have had a joint commu¬ 
nion service on Thursday of Holy Week. That was begun at the 
suggestion of the Baptist minister and was begun in the Baptist 
church. We rotate among the three churches and we’re back again 
this year at the Baptist church. 
How is communion taken within the Presbyterian church and has it changed 
over the years ? 
There are two methods of actually serving the communion that 
I have known of. Generally, and always in our churches here, the 
people have sat in the pews at their regular place in the church 
and the communion is administered by the pastor, but it is served 
to the people by the ruling elders in the church. Then the pastor 
serves the elders after they have served all the other members. In 
one of the older churches in our presbytery, the Hebron church 
out from Commerce, they set up some long tables down in the 
front of the sanctuary between the pews and the pulpit and put 
chairs around those tables. When enough people will come up to 
fill up all those chairs, then the elders will serve communion to 
those. They get up and go back to their places and another group 
will come up and sit there. We generally have communion once a 
quarter and usually on the first Sunday in the quarter. 
Do Presbyterians object to having musical instruments in the church ? 
In my lifetime, I have known of one minister who did not believe 
in having musical instruments in the church because, as I recall 

============================================================
PAGE 245
============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS 
243 
his attitude, they were not commanded in the New Testament. Most 
Presbyterian churches do have musical instruments. We believe that 
an instrument can be an aid in worship. [We believe] that the music 
in the church ought not to be a matter of show, it ought not to 
be just a performance, but it ought to be an act of worship. So, 
we use the instruments to encourage and aid the people in their 
singing. We believe that this can strengthen the worship of the 
church. So, we do have musical instruments in the church. They 
used them in the Old Testament. If you read the Psalms you’ll see 
them over and over again. Occasionally [singings] are held in Pres¬ 
byterian churches. Our people have not stressed them as much as 
some other branches of the church have, but once in a while we 
have had them. 
Do they ever have camp meetings ? 
Yes, the Presbyterian churches have done that in the past. There 
is still one place in Georgia which has had camp meetings for years. 
They have little cottages now for the people to come and live in. 
They don’t usually come and put up tents. That is at Camp Smyrna, 
which is between Atlanta and Covington, where that practice is still 
carried on and has been for many, many decades. 
How do Presbyterians feel about foot washing? 
I have never known of a foot-washing service in a Presbyterian 
church. Our understanding of the practice of foot washing is that 
there are two sacraments within the church, the sacrament of baptism 
by which a person is admitted into membership of the church, and 
the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper which is the sacrament of fellow¬ 
ship. We do not believe that the Lord instituted another sacrament 
when he washed the disciples’ feet and said, “As I’ve done this to 
you, you ought to do this to one another.” But we believe that 
He was setting an example of service there. It was customary for 
a servant to wash the feet of guests when they came into a home 
because they wore open sandals and they walked on dusty roads 
and their feet would be dusty. In hot weather, they’d be hot and 
grimy, so it made for the comfort of the guests for a servant to 
wash their feet. Jesus was giving an example of service to His follow¬ 
ers and we think that what He really meant by that was this: that 
we should be willing to render any sort of service to a fellow Chris¬ 
tian, any sort of service that’s needed. It’s not customary in our 
country for a servant to wash the guests’ feet when they come in. 
We wear shoes with socks, and our feet don’t get as dusty and 
tired. If it were customary to do that in this country, and there 

============================================================

============================================================

PLATE 49 Student Editor Keith Head, with Reverend L. B. Gibbs. 
were no servant to do it, I’d say the host ought to do it. But you 
see, it isn’t customary here and we believe that He was giving an 
example of voluntary service rather than a forced servitude. So, 
we believe that we ought to be willing to do anything for other 
people that they need, and some duties would be far more disagree¬ 
able than washing another person’s feet. But if they need it, we 
ought to be willing to do that. 
How do Presbyterians feel about snake handling and taking poison ? 
I haven’t known of them doing that in any Presbyterian church. 
As it happens, I mentioned this very thing in my sermon last Sunday 
when I was preaching on the temptation of Jesus, where He was 
tempted by Satan to throw Himself down from the pinnacle of the 
temple and come down and do an amazing thing in order to give 
people a sensation and encourage them to follow Him. The devil 
there quoted Scripture when he tried to induce Jesus to do this. 
He said, “If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down, for it is 
written, ‘He shall give His angels charge over Thee to bear Thee 
up in their hands lest at any time Thy dash Thy foot against a 
stone.’ ” That’s from the 91st Psalm. If you go back there, you’ll 
find that the devil quoted that verse exactly right, but he took it 
out of its context and he made it mean something that it doesn’t 
mean at all. When you read the Psalm, you see it’s written about 

============================================================
PAGE 247

PRESBYTERIANS 
245 
a person who’s trusting God and trying to do God’s will, not about 
a person who’s trying God out to see how far he can go and get 
by with it, and there’s a great difference between those two attitudes. 
I think snake handling, as far as I can see, seems to be trying to 
do a sensational thing, to work a wonder before people to stimulate 
them to believe. I don’t believe that Jesus ever yielded to that tempta¬ 
tion to just work a wonder before people to make them believe. 
His miracles were ministering to human needs and He did many 
things that were signs of His deity, but He never yielded to the 
demand for a sign to just prove that He was more than a man. 
Sometimes people asked Him for such a thing and He didn’t do 
it. So, that is my personal attitude about snake handling or intention¬ 
ally drinking poison. Now I believe that the Lord may have preserved 
me a lot of times from being snake bitten when I didn’t even know 
there was a snake around. But if I had seen a snake and stuck my 
foot out there in front of it and expected the Lord to save me from 
it, I think I would have been acting very foolishly. 
What's the church's stand on Divine healing? 
Generally, in the past, I don’t think the Presbyterian church has 
had healing services. There may be some that do that now; I’m 
not sure. I believe, and I think most of the ministers and most of 
the people in our churches would subscribe to this statement: that 
whenever we are healed, that is the Lord’s doing. He can do it 
with means, that is by the use of surgery and medicine and the 
care of doctors and nurses; or if it’s His will, He can do it without 
means, do it directly in a special way. I think that doctors and nurses 
are a part of His gift to us, and we believe in using their services, 
but if healing results, I believe that’s God’s doings. The doctor 
can’t make you well. He can help provide the conditions under which 
you may get well, but he can’t make you well. I believe that God 
answers prayers. I have no question that He has healed many people 
directly, without any means, and that He heals a great many people 
with means, doctors, medicine, and so forth. 
What do you think about speaking in tongues ? 
I believe that the speaking in tongues on the Day of Pentecost 
was a speaking in known languages by persons who had not studied 
the languages and learned them; as if I, under the influence of the 
Holy Spirit, could get up and begin to preach in French, which 
I’ve never studied. I think that that’s what happened on the Day 
of Pentecost, because there were people there who spoke a great 
many different languages and that was a means of spreading the 

============================================================
PAGE 248
============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
246 
Gospel to those people while they were there and enabling them 
to take it back home. Now Paul seems to be talking about something 
that may be different from that in some of his letters. I noticed, 
though, that Paul, instead of exalting speaking in tongues to the 
first place among the Gifts of the Spirit, puts it down toward the 
end. He, himself, said that he would rather, I think, speak five words 
in a language that people could understand than ten thousand in 
an unknown tongue. I believe those are the figures that he uses, 
something like that. He also lays down the prescription that if some¬ 
body speaks in tongues there should be somebody else to interpret. 
I have never had an urge to speak in an unknown tongue. That’s 
something that I simply don’t understand because I’ve never experi¬ 
enced it. If those people are really being led by the Holy Spirit, 
then they have a right and a responsibility to do that; but, personally 
for me, it would be just a human effort rather than anything that 
God would do through me. I have a question about a lot of the 
speaking in tongues in these days, as to its value to the church. 
Have you seen any of the Presbyterian people shout? 
That has not been as common in the Presbyterian church as it 
has been in some other branches of the church, which does not 
mean that we question the validity of the emotional side of a person’s 
life. We believe that it is important. Presbyterian services have been 
more along the line of instruction in the Bible; giving the people 
some solid truth to carry away with them. We believe that there is 
a legitimate appeal to the emotional side of a person’s life, and if 
his emotions are not moved, he may never be moved to do anything 
about what he hears. There’s been less open expression of that in 
the Presbyterian church than in some other branches of the church, 
which doesn’t mean that we would find fault with other people be¬ 
cause they do it another way. I don’t remember that I have [ever 
seen anyone shout]. 
Do you, personally, think that hard times cause people to come to church ? 
I think that in many cases, some special difficulty or bereavement 
or sorrow has helped to bring people into closer contact with God 
and so with His church. I can think of cases where that has been 
true. In the case of some others, it doesn’t seem to have that effect. 
So it’s varied. You couldn’t give any answer that would be universally 
true in regard to that question. 
I can think of one particular case where a young son of a family 
died, and I believe that in that particular case the church has really 
strengthened the life of the mother of that son who died. I think 

============================================================
PAGE 249
============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS 
247 
of that one particularly. I think that there are many cases where 
that is true where the loss of a loved one or some particular hardship 
has tied the person up more closely to the church. 
Did Presbyterians persecute the Holiness ? 
I don’t believe I have ever known of anything that you could 
call persecution against the people in the Church of God or those 
of the Holiness persuasion. We differ with them in some respects, 
but we accord to them the same privilege we ask for ourselves, 
the right to interpret the Bible as we understand it and [the right] 
to practice it according to our understanding of its teachings. We 
differ from a good many other groups, but we would stand up for 
the privilege of practicing the Bible as you believe it. 
What is the attitude of the Presbyterian church toward other churches ? 
There are groups that pass under the name of churches in our 
day who do not hold to what, I believe, are the essentials of the 
Gospel. In our churches where I’m serving now, we affirm our faith 
every Sunday morning in the words of the Apostles’ Creed, which 
is a good statement of belief. The Westminster Confession of Faith 
is much longer, but I subscribe to the Apostles’ Creed without any 
question. I believe that what it says is true. If people subscribe to 
that creed, they may not express it in exactly those words. I don’t 
think the Baptist people would have any great difficulty with the 
Apostles’ Creed if we used the word “universal” instead of the word 
“catholic”; and they wouldn’t have any objection to the word “catho¬ 
lic” if they understood what it means, “universal, worldwide.” It 
doesn’t mean Roman Catholic Church, although I believe that they 
are Christians in the Roman Catholic Church, too. Where we agree 
is on those things that I believe are essential: the existence of God 
as a personal God; the Trinity, God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; 
the coming of Christ into the world as the Son of God; His giving 
Himself for our sins; the necessity of our repentance and faith in 
Him. If we agree on those things, I would say that there is much 
more that ties us together than there is that separates us. Our church 
believes in cooperation with other branches of the church.

CLYDE HICKS, Presbyterian 
Reverend. Clyde Hicks, Presbyterian minister, is quite familiar with the ways 
of the old traveling preacher. His father was a circuit-riding Methodist minister 
who “had as many as seven churches at one time scattered over north Georgia. ” 
Reverend Hicks himself pastors three churches and he travels to them each 
week for services. 
Clyde Hicks grew up a Methodist and, in one of the churches of his patient 
and understanding father, he preached his first sermon at the age of twelve. 
Several years ago for “personal and theological convictions, ” Reverend Hicks 
became a Presbyterian and along with his outside business interest, he hopes 
“to spend the rest of [his] life serving these churches. ” 
Reverend Hicks has a sensitivity to the issues, problems, and needs in our 
community and he has made a commitment to help out wherever needed. His 
wife, Dolly, teaches at the high school in our county and they add positively 
to this community. We were impressed with Reverend Hicks’s straightforward 
and well-thought-out answers to our questions and we appreciate greatly his 
cooperation.

I was brought up as a Methodist. My father was a Methodist circuit 
rider. He had as many as seven churches at one time scattered over 
north Georgia. I don’t know how he managed them; [he had] three 
or four services a day. We had a morning service, a couple in the 
afternoon, and an evening service. I’m a son of a preacher and [I

preached] my first sermon when I was twelve years old. In one of 
his churches, [my father] was brave enough to let me preach and 
I preached on Jonah and the whale. I got Jonah in that whale, to 
Ninevah, and under the gourd tree praying to die in about five 
minutes. This is when I started. As a twelve-year-old boy, I started 
preaching—as a child, in a child’s way. 
I was converted in what a lot of folks would call an emotional 
atmosphere and it was an emotional experience as well as a faith 
experience. I don’t think anyone can be in love, for example, and 
not feel it. I’d hate to have my wife say, “I love you but I don’t 
feel it.” Now, we don’t go by feeling, it’s a faith thing but there 
are times, like love, that religion has a feeling. It’d be a pretty pitiful 
situation if it were without any real emotion. I had a conversion 
experience at the age of seven in a little schoolhouse in Rex, Georgia. 
There was an independent, community wide, interdenominational 
meeting going on, commonly known as an evangelistic meeting. 
They used to call them “protracted meedn’s” in those days, a term 
that is no longer used. They call them “crusades” now. This pro¬ 
tracted meeting was going on in what the Methodists used to call 
the “old fashioned way”—“kneeling on my knees and praying 
through.” Everyone was praying with the adults—the big sinners. 
They thought little Clyde was not a bad boy but I felt I had the 
potential of all the evil the big folks had, I just hadn’t done it yet. 
God convicted me. I felt a call to come to Christ, confessing my 
sins and, by faith, accepting Him and it became a viable experience. 
Shortly after, in fact, less than a month after, I felt called to the 
ministry. I’d been called all the time; I’d been feeling this. I’d preach 
to the dogs and my brothers, anybody who would listen to me. 
We’d get under the house and I’d use a five-gallon can as my pulpit. 
I’d preach to my older brothers and they’d laugh at me. Finally, 
nobody would come, so I’d take my dog up and pray for him. I 
was doing that when I was about four and it just grew on me. After 
I became converted and really came to realize Christ, then I felt 
that I must preach. It’s been that way all of my life. That was one 
of the things that kept me clean as a young boy. Rather than going 
out and doing what a lot of the fellows did, I was able to keep 
pure in terms of sexual purity and moral behavior. Drinking, smok¬ 
ing, things of that nature were never a part of my life. I always 
heard Mother’s prayers and felt the impact. It changed my life. 
Prayer was a daily thing at Mother’s knee. [I was one of] eight 
kids and they’d let me pray first at Mother’s knee. I well remember 
it as she always prayed for me, time and time again, with tears falling 
on the top of my shaved head. I well remember the times she prayed,

“Make Clyde Your boy.” She’d lay her hand on me and kiss the 
ball of my head. I’d long been asleep. I prayed first and by the 
time everyone got around, I’d be asleep. She’d usually wake me 
up and pray for me last and I’ve felt the tears on my head many 
times. This was one of the guiding lights that kept me clean as a 
young man. 
God clinched it in an emotional experience and I can remember 
when. I drove down a stake, you might say, and I know when and 
where for me it happened. I wouldn’t say that that’s required for 
everybody. Whether you’re on your knees or standing is secondary. 
It’s [the] position of the Spirit that counts. 
I was pastoring in a Methodist church when I became Presbyte¬ 
rian—about thirteen years ago. About four years ago while praying, 
I felt the vision—dream, conviction, whatever you want to call it— 
that I would be pastoring at least two or three churches in Rabun 
County. Nobody knew it but God. I knew it because He told me. 
So, purely on the face of that feeling, I decided to buy a business 
here from [a man who is] a Presbyterian elder. Realizing the need 
of a ministry, an ordained ministry, an on-going ministry in small, 
struggling churches that can’t afford a pastor, he was quite anxious 
that we work out an agreement. That’s why I’m here. I became a 
“tent-maker” minister and made my own way and served the 
churches. 
Now my father was not only a circuit rider during the forties, 
but he was also a farmer and an upholsterer. His motivation was 
to have a business [in order] to serve his churches. This is my motiva¬ 
tion. I wouldn’t be in business for the sake of business. It’s secondary 
to me. My first commitment is to God and to my churches. 
Each of my churches has around twenty-six members. I have Clay¬ 
ton Presbyterian, Timpson Presbyterian, and King Memorial—lo¬ 
cally [it is known] as the Persimmon Presbyterian but actually it is 
the King Memorial, a log church built in 1928. 
How long have the Presbyterians been in this areal 
Tiger Presbyterian Church is the mother church and I think it 
goes back to around the turn of the century. It was then and still 
is a member of the Athens Presbytery. It started in Tiger and then 
it branched out. The youngest church in the county is Clayton Pres¬ 
byterian Church. 
How is the Presbyterian Church governed? 
A Presbyterian church has basically four courts. [First, you have] 
the session, which are local ruling elders. There are two types of 
elders. The ordained minister is a teaching elder. Those who’re 

============================================================
PAGE 253

PRESBYTERIANS 
251 
not teaching ministers are elected by the congregation and are ruling 
elders. They govern the church, elect persons to membership and 
have authority within the local congregation. The [second] court 
is the presbytery which is constituted of a number of Presbyterian 
churches, with their sessions, within a convenient geographical prox¬ 
imity. Then [third], you have the synod which is constituted of a 
number of presbyteries over a much larger area and [fourthly] you 
have your general assembly. 
[The church government] hasn’t changed since the beginning of 
Presbyterianism. It goes back to the New Testament concept. The 
word “presbytor,” meaning “elder,” is a Biblical word used by Paul 
in some of his letters to Timothy. The elders are in charge of the 
church, actually. The pastor is the moderator of the session, or 
Board of Elders. As pastor, I have a vote if I want to use it but I 
don’t have to. I do not run the church at all. The affairs of the 
church are conducted in behalf of the congregation by the elected 
rulers or ruling elders. 
Were the Presbyterians well accepted when they came into this area? 
I was not here [when they first came in]. I would not think, how¬ 
ever, that there was a great deal of hostility because we [now] have 
six churches serving six communities. That, in itself, would be a 
testimony of the acceptance by those communities. Mr. L. B. Gibbs, 
[who] was pastoring in the 1920s in Tiger, rode over the mountain 
on a horse to establish the Timpson church, which I am now pastor¬ 
ing. At this moment there is no hostility between the Presbyterians 
and other churches that I know of. It’s a beautiful relationship and 
has been. We sense that we are all a part of God’s vineyard; [none] 
of us has an exclusive claim on God’s vineyard. 
Have you seen any changes within the church since you became Presbyterian ? 
[Yes. For example,] our presbytery launched, through the Lily 
Foundation of Chicago, a rural “self-help” type of program. Our 
presbytery is one of the three places in the United States and the 
only one in the southeast [where this is taking place]. The foundation 
adopted the Athens Presbytery’s rural churches in Rabun County 
as a kind of test project on strengthening the rural church. All the 
churches have had congregational inquiries [with] the people divided 
into small groups. We entertained and answered questions on what 
we can do to help ourselves. Now out of that, of my three churches, 
one gave their feeling and they seem to be quite satisfied. Another 
gave their feelings and they’re still agonizing on certain issues on 
how to improve their situation. The third has started a Wednesday

evening gathering. They had always thought the preacher ought 
to come do it but when I did go and do it, there was little or no 
interest. Now they’ve had [Wednesday evening service] going for 
about eight months. They meet together for Bible study. For exam¬ 
ple, they will study next Sunday’s Sunday school lesson, then come 
back and restudy it Sunday. They’ll all take the. lesson, read it and 
study it. Then they go home and prepare for next Sunday’s lesson. 
[They’ll study] about twenty minutes, then they’ll sing about twenty 
minutes, then they’ll have about five of ten minutes of prayer— 
praying around. This is part of the revitalization of the church, part 
of the change. It’s a new spirit. 
[In the past] the Presbyterians never looked upon the “tent-mak¬ 
ing” ministry as very important. [But] it finally dawned on the offi¬ 
cials—both the presbytery and the general assembly—that the 
country churches don’t need anything fed down from the headquar¬ 
ters. They need something from the grass roots up. And the emphasis 
now in the Presbyterian church is that rural churches need to be 
free. Give them all the support you can and not just financial support. 
The presbytery is encouraging self-help and is helping rural churches 
in grants for improvement of the facilities and some pastoral support. 
But [the self-help idea] is to encourage men like me, who left a 
comfortable pulpit, to secure a business or to go into some profes¬ 
sion, such as teaching or social work or into some agency within 
local governments and at the same time, to give of himself and 
encourage the people to do what they can do. So, what they call 
me now is a “tent-maker” minister. The Baptists have had this secret 
all the time and they’ve been ahead of the Presbyterians. Presbyteri¬ 
ans are just now catching on to the concept. So this is what I am 
and what I expect to be. I hope to spend the rest of my life serving 
small churches. 
What special services do the Presbyterians hold? 
Our rural churches are distinctly rural with rural traditions such 
as homecomings and singings. Down at Timpson, they have a singing 
once a month. They’re open to meet there as a community. The 
little churches in the rural areas are also used for community activi¬ 
ties and if people want to get married in them, they can. 
We have homecomings. It’s just a traditional type of homecoming 
with dinner on the ground. They call it an “all day singing with 
dinner on the ground,” but it’s not really. They have a morning 
service with maybe a guest speaker or former pastor and then they 
have a big dinner on the ground. After that, they go up and sing 
a little bit. Just meet and generally get together. It’s a good thing. 

============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS

[Some Presbyterian churches] have what they call “preaching mis¬ 
sions. They don t use the term “revival,” but the country churches 
still say, Let s have a revival meeting.” And that’s what they do. 
They get somebody to come in and preach Monday till Sunday and 
give invitations to “get saved.” 
Our churches have Bible schools. Mr. and Mrs. John Hull are 
proponents of assisting small churches in Bible schools. They come 
in the area with about fifty young people from all over the nation 
and hold Bible schools. Now, this year we did not [have Bible school] 
that way. We did not use them. And this is a change, too, [since] 
for the last three years we have been conducting our own Bible 
school. This means the people are getting educated to do it; they’re 
not depending on someone else to come in and do it for them. 
But now, from time to time, we have this available to us. But Bible 
schools, Sunday school, morning worship, singings, homecomings— 
these are the big things and they serve the needs of the community. 
Do Presbyterians outwardly show emotion in their worship? 
You do not find a great deal of emotionalism within the Presbyte¬ 
rian church. Usually within the Presbyterian church you could sense 
a depth of feeling and even be moved to tears but not shaking 
tears; not the kind of outward expression that you would find more 
freely in some of the Baptist and Methodist and Pentecostal 
churches. Methodists used to be called “shouting Methodists,” but 
you don’t see many shouting Methodists anymore. Presbyterians 
and Methodists are usually about the same tone. 
[In our worship service, my congregations] appreciate the pastor 
opening the invitation [to come to the altar] by singing “Just As I 
Am” just like they do in the Baptist church. When people come 
down, I make it clear that they’re not coming down to join the 
church but that they’re going to become a Christian. [When] they 
come down, if they are seeking Christ, we take them to the council 
room and deal with them personally with scriptures and prayer. If 
they want to join the church, they can come down and make it 
known that they’d like to transfer their membership. We believe 
in the council room. Bringing people to Christ should not be done 
before a gawking congregation. It ought to be in extreme privacy. 
This is another Presbyterian concept. I’ve led a number of people 
to God in the privacy of a study after the morning service. People, 
however, still like to see others coming down and publicly witnessing 
to their faith. That’s a part of the rural Presbyterians’ practice. 
Incidentally, the Presbyterian concept of the altar is not a rail. 
You won’t see an altar rail in Presbyterian churches. The Presbyte- 

============================================================
PAGE 256
============================================================

254 FOXFIRE 7 
rian concept of the altar is where you meet God, that’s the important 
thing—when and where you meet God. 
The Presbyterian church has always emphasized the intellectual 
approach to religion. This is not to say that the others didn’t empha¬ 
size it but the Presbyterians have built a good theological base. 
They have always carried the idea that one must not only inspire 
the soul but one must also teach the mind to give it something to 
hold on to in an hour when one is not so spiritually inspired. 
Do Presbyterians baptize? 
We reject the concept that you’re not baptized unless you’re im¬ 
mersed. First of all, we are baptized in Christ by a faith experience. 
I would not be one, for example, to say that Quakers are not Chris¬ 
tians because they have no form of baptism. Baptism, basically, is 
an ordinance that Christ instituted but I think Christ would be the 
first to use logic to say if it takes soap and water to clean your 
skin, it certainly takes more than water to cleanse your soul. The 
soul cannot be cleansed by physical baptizing. If so, then your soul 
would be temporal and the soul is spiritual. 
Our method, primarily, is sprinkling [which] goes back to the 
Old Testament. You’ll find that the government of the Presbyterian 
church is an Old Testament government, the old Hebrew govern¬ 
ment, as is our baptism. It’s a kind of sacrifice—the sprinkling of 
the blood of the sacrifice on the altar. It’s a kind of reliving of the 
Old Testament experience. The concept of pouring is not forbidden 
nor is immersion. Our concept of baptism is that it ought to be in 
the church as a part of the church worship experience. We believe 
first one ought to believe in Christ and baptism should follow one’s 
profession of faith. One is a Christian first, by faith, and baptism 
is a seal of one’s experience in Christ. One Sunday morning I bap¬ 
tized four in a congregational service and then delayed the service 
to a mill pond where we baptized two more by immersion. And I 
held them under until they got soaking wet. I wanted to make sure 
that they were real good and baptized! 
We encourage [sprinkling babies]. When a baby is sprinkled, he 
becomes a non-communicate member of the church. The word “non- 
communicate” is important because it means he can never hold 
office, he can never vote, he can never participate in any active 
way other than attending the services of the church and the ordi¬ 
nances of communion and baptism. He can never participate in 
any active way in terms of business until he professes his own faith. 
This gives the church a kind of in-road, and this commits the parents 
in the presence of the congregation. It commits the parents and 

============================================================
PAGE 257
============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS 
255 
the church to a mutual concern and conviction to pray for the salva¬ 
tion of that child. So, being a member of the church is not actually 
salvation but is a way for the church to say, “We have you on a 
special prayer list and we will stand by you and surround you with 
prayer, hope, and faith until you come to the age of accountability.” 
When children make their own profession of faith as they become 
older, then they can confirm the vows of their parents at their infant 
baptism or can be re-baptized if they want to. I encourage them 
to be re-baptized because I believe if a man is going to experience 
baptism, he ought to know what it is for himself and he doesn’t 
know it as a child. There’s nothing to forbid him to affirm his baptism 
and not to be re-baptized. That’s been the stand of the Presbyterian 
church. 
It’s not a free ticket. The emphasis is really for a public commit¬ 
ment on the part of the parents. They affirm their faith at the moment 
of the baptism of the infant. It puts those parents on record before 
the world that they believe in Christ and are going to rear their 
child Christ-like. It also puts the church on its toes by assuming, 
through a covenant relationship, their responsibility to pray for the 
child. The parents and the church enter a covenant on the behalf 
of “little Susie,” and they’re going to stick with this little girl until 
she comes to the knowledge of her own salvation through Jesus 
Christ. This has always been part of the Presbyterian concept. This 
is why a lot of kids grow up in the church and stay with the church 
because there’s a common bond established during infancy. 
How do Presbyterians feel about speaking in tongues ? 
Technically and theologically we do not deal with the issue of 
tongues at all, although the Charismatic Movement, which is a mod¬ 
em, interdenominational movement of tongues, is very strong in 
certain areas of the Presbyterian church, but not in this county. I 
personally and theologically do not agree with those who accept 
the concept of tongues as the single—and I emphasize “single”— 
evidence of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. I do not tliink it’s Bibli¬ 
cally or intellectually sound—nor theologically sound. Be that as 
it may, I’ve often said that if God tells a fellow to stand on his 
head and that’s the way he can best be blest, then let him stand 
on his head! Presbyterians have never been that concerned over 
the theological issues to the point of grieving the Spirit. A man 
has rights, as God gives him the understanding to interpret these 
things; although, theologically and Biblically, I do think, probably, 
the tongue movement and the Pentecostals are not totally scriptural 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
256 
in some things. But that’s my personal opinion and I do not condemn 
them. They probably would not think that Presbyterians are totally 
scriptural, either. 
Do you practice snake handling? 
No, no. I don’t know if that even goes on in the county. Now, 
Presbyterians do not permit it. I don’t think the Pentecostals, in 
this area, even permit it. This is where total literalism of scripture 
can get you in trouble. This is why I personally believe that you 
have to read the scripture in the light of the time in which it was 
written and if you take it out of its context you’re in deep trouble. 
So that’s why I am not a literalist in the sense of total literalism 
of scripture. Snake handling doesn’t make good sense to me and 
it’s not essential to prove your faith. But if I were a literalist in 
scripture, I’d probably do like some of those. But I think that’s 
one case where I wouldn’t be literal. A total literalist is often inconsis¬ 
tent. And this is one of the areas of inconsistency. Even good Baptist 
brothers who are strongly literalist in scripture don’t handle snakes. 
Do you believe in predestination ? 
Some of the Calvinists, the early Presbyterians, believed strongly 
like the Primitive Baptists: What is to be will be and you can’t change 
it. Well, we have what we call predestination. I do not accept the 
position that some are chosen to be lost and some are chosen to 
be saved in the sense that God looks at you and says, “I like you. 
I’ll take you. I don’t like you, I’ll not take you.” God would be 
unjust to do that. But I believe that there are conditions in which 
the concept of predestination are couched. I do believe in predestina¬ 
tion. I do believe that it’s a Biblical doctrine. It’s a question of 
interpretation. My concept of predestination—it might be different 
from other Presbyterians—is that there is a law of cause and effect. 
Did God predestine Ninevah to be destroyed? He said it would 
be. He told Jonah that in forty days it would be destroyed. Was 
God lying? Ninevah was not destroyed. He spared Ninevah. Did 
He lie? No. The condition of their destruction was if they did not 
repent. The law of cause—if they repent not, they die; the effect 
would be that they would die. If the cause was a good cause, the 
cause of repentance, they would live. This is the simple approach 
to predestination. 
How do you feel about Divine healing? 
Oh, I believe in Divine healing. We’ve had this experience. It’s 
part of the scripture even as speaking in tongues is part of the 
scripture. I don’t reject tongues as unscriptural. I do, however, reject 

============================================================
PAGE 259
============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS 
257 
the emphasis on tongues as a single evidence of the baptismal spirit. 
That s what I reject and that’s what scripture rejects. You see, speak- 
ing in tongues is one of the spiritual gifts. There are nine gifts in 
the scripture. And the speaking of tongues is only one gift. The 
gift of healing is another gift. Yes, I have laid on the hands. I have 
anointed with oil. Presbyterians normally do not practice that, but, 
you see, I have a Methodist background as well as a Presbyterian- 
Calvinistic background. I feel like I have the best of both, which 
gives me a broader spectrum than one who’s been reared a Presbyte¬ 
rian all his life and has never seen anything else. I’ve been on the 
Methodist side. I am now on the Calvinistic side of theology. I have 
seen the Methodist emphasis, which is experiential religion and the 
Presbyterian emphasis [which] is intellectual, theological religion. 
[The Presbyterians are] swiftly giving expression to the concept of 
experiential religion. They’ve never ruled it out, of course, but 
they’ve never been as emotionally expressive as they are today. So, 
I think that’s a change in the Presbyterian church. While the other 
churches have come from emotionalism to a more theological stance, 
the Presbyterians have done just the opposite. Now I think they’re 
meeting. I really think they’re meeting. 
Have you ever seen anybody healed? 
Sure. In fact, my last church I pastored as a Methodist, I had a 
lady that had facial neuralgia. She was to have her face operated 
on. She asked me for the laying on of hands, which is scriptural in 
the 5th chapter of James and she took it literally. I called the elders 
of the church around, we laid on the hands on her head, she knelt, 
we prayed and as we prayed, I felt the power going through my 
hands just like electricity. It went right through my hand and went 
right into her head and I felt it. She just jumped and quivered all 
over. Suddenly she lifted up and said, “I’m healed,” and she’d been 
healed. She is today. She never had the operation. Now, I did not 
do it; God did it. I was an instrument of God’s healing. Healing is 
one of the nine gifts. But I would be very radical and very narrow 
to say you have to have this one gift or you don’t have God’s spirit, 
that [without it] you don’t have the baptism of the Holy Spirit. If 
you read the 12 th chapter of 1st Corinthians, Paul talks about the 
gifts, but in the 13th chapter, he says, “but, gentlemen, seek the 
best gifts,” and he enumerates them, nine. I presume Paul enumer¬ 
ated them according to importance. But then he said, “Seek the 
best gifts and yet I showed you a more excellent way, the way of 
love.” Yes, I believe in healing. 
I kept a little vial of olive oil in the pulpit in the event someone

asked for this, because many people take the scriptures literally in 
everything. I think if you do that everytime, you can be in difficulty. 
But that, of course, is a great debate in the church. At any rate, I 
believe literally what the Bible says on healing and I think you can 
be healed. My wife, in fact, is an example of it. She was healed of 
cancer about ten years ago. And she’s healed today and we cease 
not to thank God every week. Hardly a day passes we don’t thank 
the Lord, because God did this. You see Presbyterians can be healed, 
too. We’re all God’s children if we know Jesus. 
Do you think people are falling away from the church ? 
From my experience, I do not believe the church is fading. Our 
churches have been holding their own programs. In fact, Timpson 
is growing; King Memorial is holding its own. It’s an older commu¬ 
nity, but it still has a great number of young people and quite a 
few young adults. The one thing that doesn’t change basically is 
the church. Your school changes, the government changes, your 
politics change, your social concepts change, but your rural churches 
still believe in and preach Jesus Christ as the hope of the world 
and that hasn’t changed. As long as people can experience the 
warmth of their religious faith, it won’t change. As long as the pastors 
can preach from experiential religion. If a guy comes in and all 
he’s got is intellectual training and theological training with no heart 
in it, it’ll be like hitting an anvil—he will be the one to crumble. 
I’ve^seen so many come and go. These young boys think they’re 
going to convert the world to a new social order. Their sense of 
evangelism is to change the social fabric of society, but our belief, 
and the Bible teaching still is and has been and shall always be, 
that it is Jesus Christ who changes the world through people who 
are converted to Christ. Because the world is still made up of people, 
individuals, and if you don’t change individuals, you don’t change 
the world. So that hasn’t changed, I don’t think, and if it has, I’m 
not willing to admit it. I’ve been at the preaching business twenty- 
six years now and I hope to be at it till I’m eighty. I believe in it!

Sid McCarty, a devout Presbyterian, is a supporter of the Charismatic move¬ 
ment which is finding its way into non-Pentecostal churches. The Charismatic 
Movement places emphasis on the empowerment of the Holy Spirit and is 
usually evidenced by glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, or sometimes by healing. 
Although he loves his church and its ideology, Mr. McCarty regularly attends 
meetings of other denominations and believes strongly in interdenominational 
cooperation. Mr. McCarty has served his own church in a number of capacities 
including elder, Sunday school superintendent, teacher, and sponsor of the 
church’s young people ’5 organization. 
KEITH HEAD 
When I was about thirteen, I joined the Presbyterian church; 
mostly because my dad thought I was old enough and it was the 
thing for me to do. But really, there was no change in my life at 
that time. A few years after that, I went off to school in a small 
community where there were only two churches, a Methodist and 
a Baptist church. At that time, the Baptist people decided to build 
a new church, so they tore down their old church. The Methodist 
people invited the Baptist people and everyone else to come worship 
in their church during this time. While we were all worshipping 
together, they decided to have a revival. I remember that one day

our math teacher gave us about twenty problems to work and hand 
in the next day, but he said, “Anybody that goes to that meeting 
will be excused from working these problems.” So, the whole math 
class was there that night! That was the night that I went down 
and gave my heart to the Lord, along with several other young 
people. I remember, after the meeting, the preacher said that he’d 
like to talk to us, so we went up. Something I remember he told 
us was if we ever got in a bind, all we had to do was call on the 
Lord and He’d be right there to help us. 
[I had a friend who was] an older boy than I, and smarter; he 
made better grades, and I looked up to him. Well, the next day 
he came up me to and said, “Boy! that was a crazy thing you did 
last night.” 
And I said, “What do you mean?” 
He said, “When you went down there last night and gave your 
heart to the Lord. There’s not any God. That’s just something people 
have cooked up in their own mind, just to satisfy themselves and 
make themselves feel better. But, really, there is no God. When 
you pray to the Lord it does no good. It’s just foolishness.” 
Well, I didn’t pay too much attention to him, but still, what he 
said had its effect. I was living on a farm at that time and one job 
that I had was to ride a horse way back in the mountains to check 
on and salt the cattle. They had free range then, and I was supposed 
to go one morning on a certain day. [One morning] they told me 
I couldn’t go that day, because they had to plow the horse that I 
was planning to ride, so I said okay. In a little while the blacksmith 
came to the farm and he had a day’s work there. And, boys! he 
was riding the prettiest saddle horse that I ever saw. They told 
him what had happened, and he said to me, “Now, you take my 
horse and go check on the cattle; but you’ve got to be back here 
at a certain time, because after I quit here, I have a full day’s work 
to do at home, and I’ve got to leave here then. If you can’t get 
back here by that time, don’t go.” I told him he could count on 
me. I’d be back. So, I borrowed his horse and rode way back in 
the mountains. 
I remember passing the last house and it looked like nobody was 
home. I went on quite a ways and I came to the pasture where 
the cows were. I let the bars down, led the horse in, put the bars 
back up, walked around and checked the cattle, and put salt on 
the various rocks. Everything was okay, so I decided that I might 
as well go on back. I started to catch the horse, and, boy! as soon 
as that horse saw me coming toward him, he wheeled and ran. That 
didn’t disturb me much; I figured I could catch that horse, although 

============================================================

I didn’t have a rope or anything to catch it with. I decided I’d just 
make out like I wasn’t interested in catching him and walk up close 
to him, and all of a sudden jump and catch his bridle reins; but I 
couldn’t get closer than ten feet to him before he’d run! So I got 
a long limb off of a tree there and I decided that I’d push it along 
the ground, get it so close to him, and twist it in the bridle reins 
and catch him that way; but he saw that limb coming at him and 
he turned and ran. Then I decided I’d take that long limb and I’d 
hem him up in a corner of the fence and catch him that way. I 
got him hemmed up in there and he saw that he was hemmed up. 
He run right over, hit that limb, knocked me down, and just kept 
going. I tried everything I could; I just couldn’t catch that horse. 
I remember I sat down on a rock and I thought the situation over. 
I thought about going down to that last house that I’d passed, 
and see if I could get some help—maybe somebody’d have a rope 
or another horse. Then I figured by the time I walked down there 
and got somebody and walked back up to where I was, it’d be getting 
dark and I never would catch that horse after dark. So, I gave that 
up. My time was running out, and I didn’t know what to do. I thought 
about what that preacher said. He said, “If you ever get in a bind, 
all you have to do is call on the Lord, and He’ll help you.” Then 
I thought about what my buddy said. He said, “Aw! There’s not 
any God! There’s no use to pray to Him.” Then I figured, now’s 
a pretty good time for me to find out which one was right. I didn’t 
know too much about praying, so I just said something like, “Lord, 
if You really do exist, and if You really do answer the prayers of 
Your people, please help me catch this horse.” And, boy! I hadn’t 
said any more than “amen.” I was sitting on a rock and there that 
horse was a’grazing. The bridle rein had went down over the side 
of his neck and formed a loop right on the ground. [When] I got 
up and took one step toward that horse, his left forefoot went right 
into that loop. Then I jumped at him. He threw his head back first 
thing, and that drew that loop right up around his foreleg. He stood 
up on his hind legs, and he saw that he was in a trap. He just 
stood right still for me to come and untangle him, and I took him 
home in a hurry! Next day, I looked up that old boy who told me 
that there wasn’t any God, and I told him what had happened. He 
said, “Ah, that was just a happen-so. That’d have happened anyway.” 
I figured that he hadn’t been under the same experience; he hadn’t 
been trying to catch that horse. 
I left that country about then and to my knowledge, I never did 
see that boy again. Three or four years ago, I was reading the obitu¬ 
ary column in the Asheville [North Carolina] Citizen and I saw where

that same boy had just died ... and they called him “Reverend,” 
Reverend so-and-so. Somehow during that time the Lord had got 
to that boy, and he had turned to be a preacher. 
\ 
How does it feel to have a conversion experience ? 
I think the difference in my feeling after I was converted was 
that I had an entirely different outlook on life. Before then I didn’t 
consider education or living my life for a purpose was important. 
But after then, one of my teachers—all of my teachers—noticed 
the big difference in me. I never failed in any course I ever took 
after that. I began to live my life for a purpose after that. That 
was one of the biggest differences. And after then, I always went 
to the Lord about any important decision that I had to make. I 
began to depend on Him for guidance and protection, prosperity, 
and everything that comes with it. 
Does the Charismatic movement in the Presbyterian Church involve more em¬ 
phasis on the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues ? 
Yes. It’s a new thing. There are those who are involved in it; 
there are those who are afraid of it and run from it; there are those 
who are indifferent. There is a group of Presbyterians known as 
the Presbyterian Charismatic Communion. They had a meeting a 
month or so ago out in California, and there were over five thousand 
that attended, whereas when all the representatives and everybody 
come to the General Assembly [meeting] of the church, there’s only 
about fifteen hundred to two thousand who attend those meetings. 
But over five thousand attended this Charismatic meeting. The big¬ 
gest change I see in the Presbyterian Church is their acceptance 
of the Charismatic movement, and that has brought some changes 
in it. As far as I can tell, the worship services are about the same. 
In the individual lives, I think, Presbyterians are more emotional 
now than anytime that I’ve known. 
What is your feeling about (he Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues ? 
I think it’s a gift of the Lord. I think it’s available to His people 
if they want it. I don’t think He forces it on anybody. I think it’s 
certainly a way in which we can praise the Lord more effectively 
than we can with our mentality. When we speak in tongues our 
little mind and mentality is not standing there editing everything 
we say. Praising the Lord through Holy Spirit ... the Holy Spirit 
is refurnishing the voice, but God is furnishing the language and 
what we say. 
A lot of people say and believe that everybody is filled with the 
Holy Spirit when they are converted. I think when we are converted. 

============================================================
PAGE 265
============================================================

PRESBYTERIANS 
263 
we do receive a measure of the Holy Spirit. And I think, generally 
speaking, the Holy Spirit is given by measure; some people have 
more than others. One person may have more at one time than 
he would at another time. The Bible tells us that Jesus was given 
the Holy Spirit without measure. I think when we are converted, 
we are led by the Holy Spirit to seek the Lord and to accept Him. 
The Bible speaks of Baptism in the Holy Spirit, and that’s the way 
I like to refer to it, because that’s the way the Bible refers to it. I 
think when we’re Baptized in the Holy Spirit, we may speak in 
tongues at that time, or we may not. Most people, I suppose, believe 
that you do speak in tongues. I think when I received the Baptism 
in the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, I didn’t know anything about 
speaking in tongues. 
I went down one night to Georgia [to hear a Pentecostal preacher]. 
I was sitting there before the service had started, and no one had 
said anything. Nobody had prayed, nobody had sung, nobody had 
preached. We were just waiting for the service to start, and this 
man came in, walked up on the platform and put his Bible on the 
pulpit. He laid his hands over his eyes just a moment, and prayed 
for just a few seconds. As he did that there was a heat wave started 
at the top of my head and went right down over my body, just 
like that. I didn’t know what was happening and I began to weep. 
. I didn’t know ’til sometime later that that was what happened when 
a person received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. But it was a long 
time after that—several years—before I actually spoke in tongues 
freely. 
How do Presbyterians feel about Divine healing? 
The Presbyterians, certainly, believe in praying for the sick and 
I think we believe that the Lord answers prayer. Since the Charis¬ 
matic movement has come into the church to such an extent, there’re 
many, many instances where people have been healed physically 
through prayer. We believe that—I certainly do. The church also 
believes and teaches that a person can be in torment physically and 
one way the Lord might heal that person is to take him right out 
of this life into a life that has no suffering. He’s healed that way 
many times. 
[I’ve seen people healed.] My wife used to have arthritis real bad. 
She’d have to roll out of bed. Many times I’d just have to dress 
her and button her clothes for her. She could do her hair, but with 
real bad pain. We went to Charlotte [North Carolina] one time to 
a healing meeting—the first one I’d ever been to. It was one of 
Kathryn Kuhlman’s meetings. During the service Kathryn Kuhlman 

============================================================
PAGE 266

FOXFIRE 7 
264 
said, “There’s somebody up in the balcony who’s been healed of 
arthritis, and somebody over there of bursitis.” Then she said, “The 
Lord tells me that everybody who has arthritis in here can be healed. 
Just claim your healing.” I was sitting right by [my wife,] Betty, 
and she poked me and said, “Look here! Look here!” She could 
move her hands just like that, and her arthritis was gone. She claimed 
it, and she’s claimed it ever since. That’s been six or seven years 
ago, I guess. She doesn’t have any now. She was healed. 
I saw hundreds of people healed there, not only of arthritis, but 
all kinds of stuff. There was a little girl who had polio. She was in 
body braces, and she couldn’t walk or anything. Her mother took 
her up on stage and she said she felt that she was healed. Kathryn 
Kuhlman told the mother to take her in the dressing room and 
remove the body brace and bring her out. She did, and her mother 
just about had to carry her out. Kathryn Kuhlman, I remember, 
put her arm around her, and said, “Now, let’s walk across the stage.” 
She walked across with her help, but could hardly walk. [When they 
walked] back, [Kathryn Kuhlman] said, “Now, let’s go a little faster, 
and a little faster.” About the third or fourth time, Kathryn said, 
“Now, you try it, yourself, by His help.” [The girl] kind of wobbled 
across the stage by herself, and then she said, “Now, go a litde 
faster by yourself.” And, about the fourth time, I’ll tell you, that 
young’un was hopping and a’skipping, and throwing her arms, run¬ 
ning back and forth across that stage just like she’d never been 
sick or anything. There were about five thousand people there. I 
remember Kathryn Kuhlman said, “Now, can anybody in this audi¬ 
ence refuse to praise the Lord now, over this?” She said, “Let’s 
praise Him by singing ‘How Great Thou Art.’ ” And, boy, I’ll tell 
you, it sounded like that roof was coming off. That was some 
meeting! 
I think that the Lord is pouring out His Holy Spirit in these times, 
more than He has anytime in my lifetime. I think He is pouring 
out His Holy Spirit now more abundantly than anytime since the 
early church or since Pentecost—maybe even more now than at 
Pentecost. When I say “more,” I mean certainly upon more people. 
At Pentecost there were just a hundred and twenty people, but now 
there’s millions and millions of people throughout the world, not 
just around us, but over the whole world.

THE CAMP MEETING 
“Camp Meetings, Camp Meetings, O glory, glory.” 
PETER CARTWRIGHT 
(METHODIST CIRCUIT RIDER) 
Historical Overview 
By Bill Leonard and Paul F. Gillespie 
T 
Ihe religion of Appala¬ 
chia has preserved one 
of the unique phenom¬ 
ena of American religion, the camp meeting. Bom in frontier 
Kentucky around 1800, the camp meeting became a vehicle of civili¬ 
zation, conversion, and social interaction in what was often the 
coarse, lonely and, the preachers said, godless life of the American 
wilderness. 
The history of the camp meeting has already been examined in 
this volume (see the chapter on the Christian Churches). The earliest 
gatherings occurred in Kentucky under the leadership of Presbyte¬ 
rian preachers such as James McCready and Barton W. Stone. They 
soon involved preachers of other denominations until Presbyterians, 
Methodists, Baptists, and even an occasional Shaker could preach 
their particular gospel, secure converts and found churches out of 
the camp meeting experience. 
Yet the camp meeting was more than a religious gathering. It 
was a social event for which folks traveled great distances. Most 
meetings lasted five to seven days and travelers had to bring supplies 
for a lengthy stay. Here persons bartered for goods, traded and 
raced their horses, argued politics, and became acquainted with their 
“neighbors.” Here, too, men and women observed frontier courting 
rituals and many marriages began at the camp meeting. The songs 
and shouting, the unity of common meals and common prayer cre¬ 
ated a bond which was vital to the development of community on 
the frontier. 
Religion was the dominant factor, however, and as the camp meet¬ 
ing became institutionalized, it became an important part of the 
religious life of the South and Southeast. Individuals who experi¬ 
enced religious travail during the year might wait for months before

“camp meeting time” could provide the necessary solace for the 
soul. Persons fighting against the call to conversion often found 
that the enthusiasm of the camp meeting swept them over into the 
ranks of the elect. Those converted in earlier camp meetings re¬ 
turned year after year to renew the original zeal of brighter days 
and stronger faith. The camp meetings soon became homecomings 
when the people of God, spread out across the mountains, came 
together to rekindle the fires of faith and strengthen the bonds of 
friendship. 
With time, many of the early camp meeting sites became perma¬ 
nent camps as land was set aside for the perpetual use of the faithful. 
The Methodists were particularly active in the establishment of per¬ 
manent camp meeting sites. Indeed, by the mid-nineteenth century, 
the Methodists had become the chief proponents of the camp meet¬ 
ing experience in America. When doctrinal divisions damaged the 
ecumenical spirit of the camp meetings, other denominations sought 
new ways of conducting revivals within the local churches. The Meth¬ 
odists, however, continued to conduct camp meetings, often in the 
same locations. Eventually, permanent buildings were erected on 
many of the sites and a schedule was developed, particularly active 
in the summer months. 
Present-day camp meetings usually are organized around a sched¬ 
ule similar to that of the frontier. There are few activities beyond 
preaching, worship, and visiting with friends. The day revolves 
around a series of services from morning to night, divided by meals 
and an afternoon rest period. Services are presided over by the 
“camp pastor” but a variety of preachers may be asked to speak 
at the services. 
Congregational participation continues to be important in modern 
camp meetings. Singing is loud and enthusiastic with soloists, and 
choirs providing “special music.” Sermons urge conversion on the 
unsaved but also stress the responsibility of those already converted 
to grow in faith and Christian maturity. Invitations or “altar calls” 
are usually given at the end of each service in order to provide 
prayer and counselling for those seeking spiritual comfort. 
Throughout the week there is also a sense of community as friend¬ 
ships are renewed and Christian fellowship shared among all who 
are present. Tears are shed, prayers are offered, and faith is renewed. 
As these interviews indicate, the camp meeting continues to be an 
important time of religious and social rejuvenation among many 
Christian groups in Appalachia.

LOUDSVILLE 
UNITED METHODIST CAMPGROUND 
Porter Glover 
The Loudsville Campground has been here right at a hundred 
and fifty-seven years. The first camp meeting was held around 1833, 
and it’s always been a Methodist institution. It had its beginnings 
when the first settlers were coming to this part of the country and 
it’s believed the name is derived from a gold miner named Loud 
who prospected in the area in the early 1830s. The original land 
upon which the permanent arbor still exists was owned by Major 
Frank Logan and he deeded this land to the trustees of the camp¬ 
ground in 1850. Additional land was deeded to the campground 
trustees in later years; in 1894 by the White brothers, Will, John, 
Frank, Henry, and Charlie. In 1949, approximately one acre was 
deeded by Mrs. Ben Ledford in the memory of Ben Ledford’s par¬ 
ents, Tom and Helda Ledford. In 1966, Pearl Simms deeded about 
one acre so that the campground would own all of the land that it 
was using. 
Before these permanent arbors were built, they had what was 
called brush arbors. Of course, I never have seen a brush arbor 
as they were used only in the very early years of the camp meetings, 

============================================================
PAGE 270
============================================================

PLATE 54 The permanent arbor at Loudsville is an example of the typical 
architectural structure of arbors. 
but I talked once to an old lady who said she would carry water 
to those that were working on the brush arbors. So they did exist 
and they were probably constructed somewhat like the permanent 
arbors, although not as big. A covering of brush and branches would 
be supported by posts and the sides were open. They would have 
their services under there. I would imagine that the brush would 
deteriorate from year to year and they had to do it over a lot. All 
of this work eventually led to a more permanent arbor that used 
split boards or shakes as a better lasting roof. 
In 1905, the arbor was extensively renovated and for all practical 
purposes, rebuilt. It has been said that Tom Ledford dragged rafters 
for over two miles using just the front wheels of a wagon as a means 
of conveyance. Beams were hand hewn and the whole thing was 
covered with hand split shingles. In 1920, a metal roof was put 
on and it lasted until 1948. In that year, the present structure we 
have was built. It was dedicated by Bishop Marvin Franklin. This 
arbor was well built and has existed like this year in and year out. 
Like the old brush arbors, the sides are open for good ventilation. 
However, the trustees store the pews or benches and they are 
brought out each year for our camp meeting. We also put down a 
load of fresh woodshavings under the arbor for each camp meeting. 
The yearly camp meetings would always be held in late August, 
but lately we’ve changed it so as not to conflict with schools which 
are opening earlier. At first, camp meeting would begin on Wednes-

day. Then for a short time it started on Tuesday and now it opens 
on Monday, running through the next Sunday. I remember when 
people would come in their wagons to camp out. Back then, most 
all of the service goers would camp out the entire week here. Many 
built small, simple log cabins or “tents” to camp in from year to 
year. “Tents” like these, are still in existence today with many being 
permanently owned by the regulars of the camp meeting faithful. 
People would bring a coop of live chickens, fresh produce, other 
vegetables, and meat. Some of these things were kept in nearby 
branches or covered earthen pits to keep cool. Milkcows were even 
brought along to the camp meetings. At first they had a public well 
for the tent holders and visitors. The business of taking buckets and 
going to get water provided the young men a way to help the young 
ladies in doing their chores and gave them an opportunity to talk 
to the ones they had been eyeing. I’m sure many courtships had 
their beginnings on trips to and from the spring or well. In 1939, 
wells were dug in convenient places and hand pumps installed. In 
1954, an electric pump was installed and a water line laid to the 
rear of all the tents. The people began to furnish their tents with 
hot-water heaters and stoves. In 1961, a sewage system was installed 
and most tent holders built bathrooms within their structures. These 
tents—or maybe more appropriately, cabins—now have all the con¬ 
veniences and some use them as weekend and vacation retreats. 
There are over fifty such tents now and many are two-story. 
A lot of local preachers came to the camp meetings and many 
good, soul-stirring messages were heard. There were testimonial 
meetings and people shouted as they talked about their religious 
experiences. We still have good camp meetings here although people 
are quieter than they used to be. But even back then in the old 
days, there were those who thought all the people were hell-bound. 
A long time ago somebody told me that on the last day of camp 
meeting in August 1886, a preacher by the name of Newt Austin 
prayed and asked for an earthquake to shake people up and make 
them change their ways. So on Tuesday night following the close 
of the camp meeting the earthquake came and it scared people. 
They quoted one of the old preachers, Lou Allan, as saying, “Damn 
Old Newt Austin.” 
Somebody told me another story that supposedly happened in 
1896. A pastor by the name of Cowan recommended that the men 
sit under one side of the arbor and the women under the other. 
This was opposed at the tent-holder’s meeting. John Henry Brown 
and his girlfriend, Miss Lora Turner, came in and sat together. The 
campground marshalls, Mr. Hughes Allen, Jim Morris, and Riley 

============================================================

Helton, promptly asked Mr. Brown to move across the aisle. Instead, 
he just left the arbor and his girlfriend followed him. Then others 
had trouble when they were ordered to move. Otis Hensley was 
ordered to move, but he refused and the marshalls removed him 
by force. In escorting Mr. Hensley off the premises, one of the 
lawmen, H. Riley Helton, was somehow stabbed. By the time of 
October court, tension had mounted so much, someone set fire to 
a row of tents and all the southside burned. This incident ended 
the separation of the sexes! 
Of course, in the early days it did not take as much money to 
operate the campground. In 1910, for example, the records show 
that the total collection for the week was $18.00. Now it is not 
uncommon for the campground to have an expenditure of $5,000 
or more. Most of the revenue comes from those who tent and others 
who come to the services. Visitors are good to help defray the cost 
of improvements and expenses for the camp meeting week. 
We have a good camp meeting each year. The district sends several 
preachers out here for the week and we have several services each 
day. There are over fifty tent holders and on Friday and Saturday 
nights, this arbor is full. The camp meeting is something out of 
the past that has continued on and on.

I was born and raised three miles from here and have been coming 
to this camp meeting for ninety-some years. I’ll be ninety-six years 
old next month. I was baptized right over there [near the front of 
the arbor]. I was sprinkled and I remember I was just a little girl 
and my little brother, John, was getting baptized at the same service. 
The preacher had poured so much water on me and I was crying 
because I was afraid that the preacher was going to drown him! 
My grandfather’s brother, Frank Logan, donated the land for this 
campground and I had an aunt who said she was five years old 
when it started. I don’t remember the brush arbors—they were long 
gone before I started coming here. But my aunt said she remembered 
them. There has been a camp meeting here every year since the 
early 1830s, except for one year during the Civil War. That may 
have been the year Sherman came through, I don’t know. 
People would come to the camp meetings back then in wagons 
and tie their stock to the trees. People would kill beef and bring 
it around here to sell. They would put the meat and other things 
that would ruin in jars and bury them underground to keep them 
from spoiling. Other things have changed a whole lot, too. When 
I first started out, we had to carry our water from the spring. We

cooked on woodstoves in the tents and there was no electricity. 
For lights in the arbor, we had pine knots burning on top of dirt- 
filled stands made of logs. We had two on each side and one up 
at the front. After that we used oil lamps and kerosene lanterns. 
I remember they had trouble at one of the camp meetings. They 
made a rule that men and women couldn’t sit together and some 
of the men didn’t like it. Some kind of row broke out and the sheriff,

Nobody knew who did it! Something like that didn’t happen a whole 
lot and we have always had wonderful camp meetings since I’ve 
been here. It’s earlier [in the summer] now because of school but 
people aren’t tenting like they used to. The tents used to be full 
but there aren’t as many here now.

7:30 p.m.: EVENING EVANGELISTIC SERVICE AT THE TABER¬ 
NACLE. 
A. All the preachers in the congregation are asked to come to 
the front. The congregation is asked to stand and they sing 
“Walking with the King.” Some of those in attendance praise 
the Lord with audible prayer as the song ends. The evangelist, 
Brother B. H. Clendennon, from Texas, walks into the taber¬ 
nacle praying and then comments on the great spirituality 
of the song. The congregation responds with a hearty 
“Amen.” The song leader, Brother Hooper, implores the con¬ 
gregation to stand and as they sing more of the song, people 
in the congregation raise hands and clap hands. At the conclu¬ 
sion of the singing, people praise the Lord vocally and raise 
hands. 
B. Brother Hooper asks the congregation to praise the Lord 
on behalf of the people’s needs and, asking if needs have 
been met, he encourages the congregation to “give the Lord 
a handclap.” 
C. Brother Cookman, the District Assemblies of God Supervisor 
from Dunn, North Carolina, talks about the story of the Ro¬ 
man Catholic who came to the camp meeting to get the Bap¬ 
tism of the Holy Ghost and how the man gets sawdust on 
him from being “slain in the spirit” on the last day. Brother 
Cookman comments on giving and then the offering is taken 
up in Kentucky Fried Chicken buckets while someone sings 
a “special”—“Since Jesus Passed By.” 
D. A young man gives his Christian testimony and Brother Cook¬ 
man asks others if they have experienced the Lord. Many 
respond by raising hands and shouting “Amen.” A series 
of songs then follows, including “He Signed the Deed,” “Be¬ 
cause He Lives,” “I Found Reality,” and “Jesus Is Lord of 
All.” Brother Cookman continues by telling about the man 
who came to the camp meeting the previous year to poke 
fun at the Pentecostals. He was converted and he will be 
coming to the present camp meeting to share his conversion 
experiences. Brother Cookman comments that if one “gets

responds with laughter. 
E. Claudia Cookman, Brother Cookman’s daughter, sings a spe¬ 
cial song, “The Family of God.” Brother Cookman announces 
that his daughter is getting married and that people may not 
get to hear her sing again. A man in the congregation shouts, 
“Let her sing again!” Brother Cookman, quickly and humor¬ 
ously, responds with a “Thank you!” His daughter sings 
“Peace,” a song that she has written but has never sung before 
an audience. After she finishes, much emotion is evident and 
people applaud. 
F. Brother Cookman introduces the evangelist, Brother Clen- 
dennon, who is from Texas. Brother Clendennon talks about 
the morning service to be held the following day and about 
offerings which have ranged from $10.00 to $2,000. He goes 
on to introduce his wife and a camp supervisor, who knows 
that it is her birthday, leads an energetic rendition of “Happy 
Birthday.” 
G. Brother Clendennon begins the sermon with the text coming 
from the eleventh chapter of Matthew. He stresses the need 
for Christians to be forceful and after a very moving and 
powerful exhortation, he asks the people to stand and worship 
God. Emotional and spiritual fervor is quite in evidence and 
many, including those seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost, 
go to the altar. Brother Clendennon calls for the Christians 
to come and pray and soon the altar is filled with people 
raising their hands, shouting and praying. After a period of 
this activity, the service comes to an end and the campers 
prepare for their night’s rest.

inging schools and 
shaped notes. Singing 
conventions and gospel 
sings. These are musical phenomena about which a vast segment 
of American society is totally unaware or grossly misinformed. This 
does not mean, however, that the folk involved are small in number 
or isolated geographically or that this culture is in danger of becom¬ 
ing extinct. On the contrary, singing gospel songs by means of 
shaped notes is flourishing throughout the country. The exponents 
of gospel song gather regularly to sing from the latest publication 
as well as to enjoy old favorites. These “sings” are not only musical 
events, but also social affairs and, for many, an expression of reli¬ 
gious faith. American youth throughout the country have “discov¬ 
ered” gospel songs. They sing them because it is fun and, along 
with ethnomusicologists and folklorists, recognize them as a vital 
part of American culture. 
But what is a gospel song, how did it originate, and what are 
shaped notes; how do they differ from traditional musical notation, 
and what is the purpose of singing schools? 
Singing schools originated in eighteenth-century New England, 
being promoted by the clergy in an effort to teach their congrega¬ 
tions to read music and thus restore some of the musical heritage 
that had perished with the first generation of settlers. In the mean¬ 
time, the congregations had developed their own style of singing. 
Everyone was expected to participate in singing the Psalms. No musi¬ 
cal instruments were permitted to assist the singers in remembering 
tunes or harmonies. As time passed, tunes were forgotten or altered 
and the congregation added its own ornamentations and harmonies 
at will. 
With the increase in illiteracy, it became necessary to provide 
assistance in the Psalm singing for those who could not read. The 
problem was solved by having the minister or clerk read or sing a 
line of the Psalm which the congregation sang after him. This prac-

tice became known as “lining out” and continued as a traditional 
way of singing Psalms long after it was needed to offset the problem 
of illiteracy. The singing of the Psalms became even slower than 
before, but the pauses at line endings gave the singers even more 
opportunity to indulge in vocal ornamentation, which, by the way, 
was considered by the singers to be a musical accomplishment. Cot¬ 
ton Mather described the resulting sound as a “jar in his ears.”1 
The clergy persisted and attempted to solve their problem by insti¬ 
tuting singing schools promoting “regular” singing by note. The 
singers enjoyed their vocal freedom and at first resisted efforts to 
change, citing as reasons that the singing school was a scheme to 
get money; it caused people to stay out late at night; the syllables 
used were blasphemous; and the young people liked it, therefore 
it must be sinful.2 Eventually the singing school became not only 
an educational tool but also a popular social institution. 
And what about those “blasphemous syllables”? The syllables had 
to do with reading music and singing accurately. They were not 
the invention of the New England singing masters, having been 
utilized in England before the Pilgrims arrived in America. The sylla¬ 
bles had been printed with the music of all of the major metrical 
psalters in England from the sixteenth century as well as in the 
Genevan Psalter.3 They were printed under the notation in the ninth 
edition of the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in North America, 
and this edition contained the first music printed in this country. 
The syllables, fa sol la mi, were used to identify the notes in the 
scale. There had been numerous scales developed by the Church 
from medieval times, but only a few were in use in the eighteenth 
century. Predominant among these were the major and minor scales. 
They differ from each other in the arrangement of intervals between 
adjacent notes, thus producing very different melodic possibilities. 
These scales usually consisted of eight pitches, the eighth being a 
higher repetition of the first. A syllable was assigned to each of 
these notes. [Ed. note: The interval between la and fa and between 
mi and fa are small intervals, called half steps, whereas the other 
intervals are whole steps.] The major scale was fa sol la fa sol la mi.

Ex. 2. Natural minor scale with syllables. 
In order to match the melodic range of a song to a singer’s vocal 
range, the scale upon which the melody is based must begin on 
whatever pitch the voice can accommodate. The notation of scales 
must sometimes be altered to achieve the pre-set pattern of the 
scale, hence the use of signs to show this alteration: a sharp (#) 
raised the pitch; a flat (b) lowered it. However, if the singer knew 
the scale syllables he could ignore reading alterations in notation, 
since the intervals between the syllables remain constant whatever 
the scale or wherever it might begin. 
The singing school taught that skill of reading the musical staff, 
reading rhythm, singing by syllables, and singing harmony parts. 
In addition, the singing school fostered the development of instruc¬ 
tional materials, books containing music to be used as lessons for 
the above skills. 
The New England compilers, men of limited musical education 
but knowledgeable about the tastes of their contemporaries, applied 
themselves to this task with gusto. Their books contained hymns, 
psalms, odes, and anthems as well as the usual introductory section 
of “Rudiments of Music.” This music was written for three or four 
parts each of which moved independently of the others. Since it 
was to be sung, each part was written on a separate musical staff. 
The compilers, who were not familiar with European rules of har¬ 
mony, wrote parts that they considered interesting to sing and 
sounded good to them. The resulting harmonies bore little resem¬ 
blance to European art music. 
Following the Revolutionary War, many musically trained immi¬ 
grants came to America. They quickly dominated the musical scene 
in the cities and ridiculed the compositions of the earlier settlers 
and their singing schools. In the cities, singing societies and choirs 
using the syllables, do re mi fa sol la si do, then in vogue in Europe, 
replaced the singing schools. In the rural areas and in the South, 
the singing school and the fa sol la syllables retained their popularity.

The two sets of syllables, fa sol la and do re mi, came to represent 
two conflicting cultural trends.4 
Americans have always been known for seeking short cuts in the 
performance of their activities. Learning to read music was an ex¬ 
tended process, so it was not unusual that a short cut would be 
sought. At the turn of the nineteenth century two enterprising Phila¬ 
delphians, William Smith and William Little, provided this benefit 
by inventing shapes for the fa sol la syllables: a right triangle for 
fa; an oval for sol; a square for la; and a diamond for mi These 
shapes were substituted for note heads but retained their rhythmic 
characteristics and were placed correctly on the music staff.

Among the nineteenth-century Southern compilers of singing 
school books using the fa sol la shapes were William Walker and 
his brother-in-law, Benjamin Franklin White, both from South Caro¬ 
lina. In 1835, Walker published his Southern Harmony, and, in 1844, 
White, who had moved to Georgia, published his Sacred Harp. 
“French Broad” from Walker’s Southern Harmony illustrates the use 
of the four shape notes.

PLATE 71 William Walker’s Christian Harmony book. 
By this time, the content of the singing school books had changed 
somewhat. Still containing the “Rudiments of Music,” they pur¬ 
ported to include hymns, psalms, odes, and anthems, as had their 
New England forerunners. Some of these were in reality folk hymns, 
religious ballads, revival spirituals, and fuguing tunes, the latter hav¬ 
ing also appeared in New England collections. 
Folk hymns are those “songs with old folk-tunes which everybody 
could sing with words that spoke from the heart of the devout in 
the language of the common man.”5 Religious ballads are the out¬ 
growth of the folk hymn adhering to the literary format of the ballad; 
that is, they tell a complete story. Revival spirituals will be dealt 
with later, but the fuguing tunes were a vital part of these collections. 
They may be described as beginning with hymn-like harmony, but 
in the second section, each part enters successively utilizing some 
type of imitation, similar to a round. The parts then finish together.6 
The highly ornamented style of singing, deplored by Cotton 
Mather and his fellow clergymen, but enjoyed by the common folk, 
had become traditional. These southern compilers wrote down from 
oral transmission the ornamentation that had become a part of the 
music. In doing so they provided an important service in preserving 
a musical heritage that might otherwise have been lost. 
But even country folk like to keep up with “progress,” and just 
before the middle of the nineteenth century, Jesse Aikin added three

shapes to the fa sol la shapes to apply to the do re mi scale. His 
scale and syllable spelling taken from his Christian Minstrel, are as 
follows:

doe ray mee faw sol law see 
Ex. 6. Aikin’s shapes from his Christian Minstrel, 1848. 
Most southern compilers, including Walker in his Christian Har¬ 
mony, switched to the do re mi scale with its seven shapes. White 
continued to use the fa sol la scale as do the present-day Sacred 
Harp editions. Walker, along with others, invented his own shapes 
for the three additional notes, but Aikin’s are the shapes that survived 
and are used today by gospel singers. “Faithful Soldier” from Walk¬ 
er’s Christian Harmony illustrates his use of the seven shape notes. 
These nineteenth-century southern singing school book compilers 
continued to write the three or four harmony parts in a style similar 
to the eighteenth-century New England writers; that is, each part 
moved independently of the others producing harmonies that were 
incidental to the melodic nature of each part. Today, with ears bom¬ 
barded with harmony only in a supporting role, this music sounds 
archaic and “different.” There is considerable use of the minor scale 
and that along with the unusual harmonies produces a music that 
is foreign to most listeners, and therefore more difficult to sing. 
Those traditional singers of music from William Walker’s Christian 
Harmony, like Quay Smathers and Richard Moss, perform the music 
slowly as directed in the “Rudiments” of the book. Although instruc¬ 
tions in their “Rudiments” are very similar, Sacred Harp singers today 
sing much faster than do Christian Harmony singers. Also in the “Rudi¬ 
ments of Music,” specific instructions are given to such things as 
volume, pronunciation, and ornamentation. In his Southern Harmony 
Walker has this to say concerning volume: 
. . . When singing in concert the bass should be sounded full, 
bold, and majestic, but not harsh; the tenor regular, firm, and 
distinct; the counter clear and plain; and the treble soft and 
mild, but not faint. 
. . . Yet how hard it is to make some believe soft singing is 
the more melodious, when at the same time loud singirtg is 
more like the hootings of the midnight bird than refined music.7 
Concerning pronunciation, Walker said: 

============================================================
PAGE 290
============================================================

288 
FOXFIRE 7 
In singing, always keep sufficiency of breath to sound the 
notes full, round and smooth, and to pronounce the words dis¬ 
tinct and plain; and never sing in pain, but sit erect on the 
seat and endeavour to sing with as much ease as you would 
talk in common conversation.8 
All notes should be called plain by their proper names, and 
fairly articulated; and in applying the words great care should 
be taken that they be properly pronounced and not tom to 
pieces between the teeth, nor forced through the nose.9 
On ornamentation, he said: 
... a few observations on the ornamental part of singing, or 
what are generally termed graces. This is the name generally 
given to those occasional embellishments, which a performer 
or composer introduces to heighten the effect of a composition. 
It consists not only in giving due place to the apogiatura [sic], 
turn, shake, or trill, and other decorative additions, but in that 
easy, smooth, and natural expression of the passage which best 
conveys the native beauties and elegancies of the composition, 
and forms one of the first attributes of a cultivated and refined 
performer.10 
Contemporary Christian Harmony singers usually ignore Walker’s in¬ 
structions on volume and sing with full voice, no vibrato, and no 
concept of blended voices. The part each sings is the important 
thing and they pride themselves on accuracy. With the moving parts, 
unusual harmonies, and added ornamentation, singing a part “by 
ear’’ is difficult. 
In 1800, a “happening” occurred on the Kentucky frontier: The 
first camp meeting was held. This, and later such revivals, greatly 
influenced future religious affairs, especially religious music, for here 
was bom the camp meeting song or spiritual. These camp meetings, 
attended largely by illiterate frontier settlers, were highly charged 
emotional gatherings. Both the events and the types of people at¬ 
tending these meetings necessitated a new kind of religious song. 
Traditional hymns, sung from memory, as well as folk hymns, were 
used. Many of these hymns underwent text simplification. Often a 
new song might spring to life spontaneously, including a combina¬ 
tion of scriptural phrases and everyday language. Verses were short¬ 
ened, refrains added and expressions and ejaculations interpolated. 
The tunes were lively with strongly marked rhythms.11 This addition 
of a refrain was one of the most important contributions of the 
camp meeting to religious music. Often these songs were in the 

============================================================
PAGE 291
============================================================

THE TRADITION OF SHAPED-NOTE MUSIC 
289 
form of a dialogue, the call and response of folk song. The leader 
sang the first phrase, the congregation answered with a related 
phrase. This type of song was also related to the lining out technique 
of the old Psalm singers. An example of the transformation of a 
hymn to a revival-type spiritual is “Jesus My All to Heaven Has 
Gone,” a poem by the English writer, John Cennick (1718-99). It 
was to become one of the most widely sung religious lyrics among 
the country folk of America during the more than two hundred 
years which have passed since it appeared.12 It was the favorite song 
of Christian Harmony singer George Smathers of Canton, North Caro¬ 
lina, who died in 1979 at the age of 101. In the example given 
here from Walker’s Christian Harmony, the response “and we’ll all 
shout together in that morning,” has been added as well as has 
the refrain. 
Texts for these spirituals reflected the topics of the evangelistic 
sermons: conviction of sin, the joys of salvation, and the expectation 
of heaven. These topics had already been incorporated in some 
religious movements by the hymns of Isaac Watts and the writings 
of John and Charles Wesley. 
Religious ballads, those narrating biblical happenings, were strong 
favorites. A not uncommon practice was the addition of one’s own 
personal religious experience after a narrative from the Scriptures. 
The experiential or mourner’s song began with the traditional “come 
all ye” and went on to explain how the subject was bom in sin, 
experienced religion, was saved and became a Child of God. Such 
songs that stressed the short, temporal life and the imminence of 
the Judgment Day were effective in swaying the wavering sinner at 
the altar.13 An even simpler form including much repetition was 
one in which new poetic lines were not added in subsequent stanzas 
but only one or two words were changed.14 
In exhorting others to enjoy the advantages of the holy life, the 
campers often invoked a martial spirit. They viewed themselves as 
soldiers enlisted under the banner of Christ, pledged to wage unceas¬ 
ing warfare against sin.15 (See previous illustration of “Faithful Sol¬ 
dier.”) 
Another important influence in the development of the gospel 
song was the Sunday school movement that began in this country 
in the latter part of the eighteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth 
century, numerous collections of Sunday school songs had been 
compiled. First designed solely for children, these songs were simple 
in character, popular in design, and intended for immediate appeal.16 
Almost all of them included a refrain. 
The Y.M.C.A., organized in London in 1844, and shortly thereaf-

ter in this country, featured the unison singing of familiar thurch 
hymns by male voices. These meetings, as well as union prayer 
meetings in large urban areas, developed spontaneity and brevity 
in the use of hymns.17 It was through the Y.M.C.A. that Dwight L. 
Moody, the nineteenth-century evangelist, met Ira D. Sankey who 
was to bring all of these currents together in his Gospel Hymns. It 
was this title of Sankey’s collection used in the evangelistic campaigns 
of Moody and Sankey that brought about the term, “gospel music” 
to identify popular religious hymnody. Neither the use of the term 
nor the style of the music was original with Moody and Sankey. 
These songs were the product of urban composers and lyricists, 
but they were intentionally designed to appeal to unpretentious 
tastes. The term, “gospel music,” came also to be applied as an 
identification of southern religious hymnody.18 
The singing schools of the South continued to operate throughout 
the nineteenth century. The compilers who lived in Virginia’s Shen¬ 
andoah Valley were both prolific and influential. Among the collec¬ 
tions widely used was one by Joseph Funk, a Pennsylvanian, who, 
like William Walker, first utilized the four-shape note method, later 
switching to the seven shapes. Funk called his seven-shape note 
book Harmonia Sacra which the country folk quickly nicknamed 
“Hominy Soaker.” Funk’s grandson, Aldine S. Kieffer, established 
the Ruebush-Kieffer Music Publishing company in Virginia. A. J. 
Showaiter, a descendant of the Funks in Pennsylvania and an associ¬ 
ate of Kieffer, established a music publishing company in Georgia 
in 1887.19 This company was the immediate forerunner of the popu¬ 
lar gospel song publishers today. 
It was Showalter who changed the format of the singing school 
books from four staves to two. The latter was much easier for instru¬ 
mentalists to read, though harder for singers.20 He also included 
more of the gospel songs than had his predecessors. 
Contemporary gospel songs have many of the same subjects as 
their predecessors, being subjective, emotional, repetitive, and evan¬ 
gelistic in thought. Also they are not related to reason or doctrine. 
The music, though related to the earlier songs especially in the 
use of the seven-shape notes, is more modem. It is characterized 
by simple melodies, strong rhythmic design with some syncopation 
and limited harmonic changes. All of it is based on the major scale. 
Twentieth-century Christians, believing the old nineteenth-century 
romantic notion that minor music suggests sadness, rejected all mi¬ 
nor music as having no place in a happy religion. The harmonies 
follow the melody, there being very limited melodic movement in 
the supporting parts. 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
A favorite contemporary song style is the statement-repetition 
style in which one voice carries the melody while the others sing a 
harmonic repetition of each phrase, either literally or in an altered 
form. In this style the melody may move from one voice to another. 
Frequently it is carried by the bass.21 
Another related style that made its appearance in the 1920s utilizes 
the “afterbeat.” This device, borrowed from band music popularized 
during and after World War I, has one voice that carries the melodic 
line while the other voices sing a word or a syllable on the second 
half of the beat. The effect is similar to the um-pah-pah heard in 
a brass band.22 
A style that has not become as popular as the others is a contrapun¬ 
tal style carried over from the earlier singing school fuguing tunes. 
In this style each part is a melodic line with its own text.23 
There is a tendency to sing the songs rapidly and, with the synco¬ 
pated beat inherent in much of the music, the tempo can become 
very lively.24 This syncopated beat, with its displaced accent normally 
associated with ragtime and jazz, has been favored by contemporary 
songwriters. This rhythmic figure, probably more than any other, 
has given gospel music its dance-like character.25 
With gospel singers, the piano has become a favorite accompany¬ 
ing instrument. Gospel song pianists have absorbed into their style 
of playing many of the popular music styles. The accompaniments 
today are a mixture of swing, jazz, full chords, octaves, and ar¬ 
peggios.26 
Because this music is fun to sing, it may have as many adherents 
outside of the church as inside, although many churches sing “gospel 
music.” This recreational aspect of the singing has led to Friday 
night meetings in homes, the fifth Sunday sings at churches and 
other informal singing occasions. 
The first singing convention came into being in the mid-nineteenth 
century, organized by Sacred Harp singers with their book author, 
B. F. White, as the first president.27 These more or less loosely 
formed conventions, organized along geographical lines, survive to¬ 
day. 
One institution that has helped to promote gospel music is the 
male quartet. First developed to assist in the sale and distribution 
of gospel songbooks, some of these groups have become highly 
commercial. However, to many others throughout the country, gos¬ 
pel singing means Christian fellowship, recreation and, most of all, 
participating with friends in a mutually satisfying musical experience.

SINGERS OF SHAPED-NOTE MUSIC 
The remainder of this section on shaped-note singing is divided into two 
parts. First, Richard Moss and Quay Smathers talk about the old-time Christian 
Harmony singing. The second part investigates the more recent gospel-style 
shaped-note music still popular in this area today. In these interviews, our 
contacts describe Friday night singings, singing schools, and singing conventions 
and elaborate on the importance of music in their lives. 
Both Richard Moss and Quay Smathers began singing Christian Harmony 
at a very early age. They have been associated with a number of singing 
schools, first as students and then as teachers at various workshops and colleges. 
Richard and Quay have sung gospel shaped-note music, but they prefer Chris¬ 
tian Harmony. They are very concerned about the continuance of Christian 
Harmony as a tradition. Centralfigures in today ’s Christian Harmony activities 
in western North Carolina, they attend and support the few singings that 
still convene. They encourage young people to learn Christian Harmony and 
to keep the practice alive and Christian Harmony singing is attracting new 
participants. Here Richard and Quay discuss their lifelong involvement in 
this traditional musical style.

CHRISTIAN HARMONY: Richard Moss 
I started singing Christian Harmony with my father when I was 
about fourteen or fifteen years old. He was a singer of that and I 
still have the old book he sang out of. I’d come home in the evening 
and he’d be sitting out on the porch with his book singing like 
the old people and keeping time. I would listen to him and hear 
him sing and then I’d sing it by memory, or as some people say 
“by heart.” I later learned the rudiments of music. Then I could 
sing any of those songs I wanted to sing. 
There is the old-time Christian Harmony singing that is not done 
too much anymore and there is this gospel-style of shaped-note 
singing. The Christian Harmony has a sad weeping tone and it also 
doesn’t have any musical accompaniment. Back then, they didn’t 
have any musical instruments whatsoever. People don’t sing Chris¬ 
tian Harmony as much anymore because it’s so hard for them to 
learn the sound of it. A lot of people can sing the gospel music

very well, but when they pick up that book of Christian Harmony 
songs, they just can’t do it. It has that weeping tone and it’s hard. 
Christian Harmony used to be the only kind of music that was 
sung around here. People liked it because they were raised up with 
it. Most of the time they sung it at church but they did sing it some 
in their homes. In those days, you didn’t have many places to go. 
Church was about the only place we had to go. People walked back 
then and boys took their dates to church with them. That’s about 
the only place we got together. 
When I started out [singing] I had to follow those adults. When 
they’d sound low, I’d sound with them. When they’d sound high, 
I’d sound with them too. I just sang along with them at the old 
church and I learned better that way too. 
My wife is a good Christian Harmony singer. And my wife’s father, 
William Anderson, was excellent at that. He was a teacher in it 
and taught singing schools. They had singing schools for people 
to learn Christian Harmony. In fact, he was the first one that ever 
got me to lead a song. He’d always get up there and then say to 
me, “Come on, my singer.” He called me his “singer.” He’d want 
me to come on up and sing and I’d go up and sing with him. He 
was one of the best Christian Harmony singers that I believe they’ve 
ever had. He and I would sing right over here at the old church, 
a little log church. It was a Missionary Baptist Church. 
I went to I don’t know how many singing schools. Back then 
you’d pay fifty cents to go to singing school for ten days. That 
went for the teacher’s salary. We’d go in the morning, take our 
lunch, and stay all day. The teacher would furnish the books and 
theories and such as that. They’d usually be from twenty to twenty- 
five [in classes], sometimes as many as thirty.

THE TRADITION OF SHAPED-NOTE MUSIC 
295 
The [gospel] shaped-note singing that has musical instruments 
to go along with it began to come in later. I was living with my 
father and mother up here in the upper end of the field. I had 
two uncles who were starting out in this type of music. They both 
became teachers in it and they’d come up to the house and we’d 
sing it. That’s how I came in contact with [that] style. 
The [gospel] shaped-note singings of today are popular. When 
we get the paper, that’s what everybody looks for first—to see where 
the singings are. I love it all right and there’s nothing wrong with 
it. From time to time, I teach this type of singing school in this 
area. But, personally, I prefer the Christian Harmony over what is 
sung today. It has that special tone—sometimes it’s called a sad 
weeping tone. I like it because it goes down in that tone. It puts 
something in your mind different from what the [gospel-style] music 
does. 
There’s been a great change in music and everything else since 
my childhood days. I was bom in 1899 and lived in a log house. I 
don’t feel like I’m that old and I still work for the Forest Service 
three days a week. It still doesn’t bother me any.

CHRISTIAN HARMONY: Quay Smathers 
Christian Harmony singing is all that I do anymore. I was bom 
in 1913 and I started out real young in it. I had an old friend by 
the name of Asbury Smathers. Just him and his wife lived together 
and when I was a young boy, I’d sit up there and sing with them. 
He was a great singer and he was a singing school teacher. 
I went to my first singing school in 1919 out at the Morning 
Star Church, so I learned to sing the notes at an early age. I rode 
to Morning Star in a wagon. But my mother, I guess, was the main 
cause of me not forgetting all of this stuff—she was a Christian 
, Harmony singer herself. She was brought up on it. That’s probably 
the main reason I didn’t drop it then and forget all I’d learned. 
Christian Harmony books couldn’t be bought—you’d have one 
over here and yonder through the community. One old gentleman 
told me, he said, “If you’re going to sing Christian Harmony and 
if you’ll sing out of it, I’ll give you my book.” So he gave me his 
book. Books were scarce and a few years later, he said, “I’ve got 
my brother’s book and I’m going to give it to you, too. You can 
have it and if I ever call for it, you can give it back.” He gave me 
that one. That was the second one I ever had. Before Asbury Smath¬ 
ers died, he gave me his. Before he died, he walked over to the 
mantel and got it. He could barely hobble over there. I collected 
up a bunch of them and had my own books.

THE TRADITION OF SHAPED-NOTE MUSIC

A good singing school teacher would come into a community 
and in ten nights would teach you the principle. Teach you the 
shape notes and teach you hard. And if you learned anything about 
music and singing, you learned it through an old singing school 
teacher like that. He’d take a chalkboard or canvas and a little musical 
literature with him and if he was good, he’d take a group and you’d 
learn to sing in ten nights of singing school. That went on until 
they started out to teaching music in the schools. But they don’t 
teach them shape notes in the school anymore. 
I’ve been teaching school at Warren Wilson College now for the 
last four years. I’ve got workshops in Berea, Kentucky and some 
in Atlanta and all around. Just shape note workshops. There’s no 
accompaniment with it of any kind—it’s just that old time Christian 
Harmony. I went to Michigan last September and I did workshops 
out there in a pine thicket. Prettiest place you’ve ever seen and 
I’ve never heard such singing in all my life. 
There’s still a Christian Harmony convention twice a year up here 
at Etowah. We meet the first Sunday in September and the first 
Sunday in May. When I first went to Etowah they were singing in 
the Etowah church. Of course, it wasn’t a very large church but 
they turned it over to us, the whole church, twice a year. We left 
there and went to the Etowah school and sang for a while in the 
auditorium. They made classrooms out of that and now we’re down 
in the cafeteria. About all that comes to Etowah is singers; there 
aren’t many spectators over there. I’ll say it varies from thirty to 
fifty that do sing and not over ten or fifteen that don’t sing. That’s 
a pretty good group. The Etowah singings start on Sunday morning 
at ten o’clock and it goes all day till we get tired. You have to 
quit pretty early for Richard Moss to leave Etowah and drive back 
home. We usually quit about three-thirty. 
We also meet at the Morning Star Church on the second Sunday 
in September. We have what is called the Old Folks Day. They’ve 
had Old Folks Day for about ninety years. They have morning Sunday 
school services and a guest speaker for the morning worship service. 
Then they have a dinner on the grounds and I mean they have dinner. 
And then just as quick as dinner is over, we have the Christian 
Harmony singing and we sing until we give out. There is no certain 
time to stop or anything like that. The only difference between Morn¬ 
ing Star and Etowah, as far as the Christian Harmony singing goes, 
is that you start singing before dinner at Etowah and you start singing 
after the morning services and dinner on the grounds up here at 
Morning Star.

PLATE 76 George Smathers, Quay 
Smathers’ father, was a well-known 
Christian Harmony singer. He died at 
the age of 101, in 1979. 
There’s as much difference as night and day between old-time 
Christian Harmony singing and the gospel shaped-note singing. 
Christian Harmony singing and gospel singing don’t mix—they just 
don’t go together. There isn’t any use for a bunch of Christian 
Harmony singers going into a gospel singing and there isn’t any 
use for gospel singers coming to Christian Harmony. They just don’t 
go together. They both use shape note but they are sung differently. 
Mind you, I like good gospel shaped-note quartet singing. I’ve sung 
in a gospel quartet when I was a boy. I like them when they sing 
and take all this foolishness out of the background. Some of these 
groups have bass drums and snare drums and electric guitars, and 
I saw one group that had a fiddle in it. And some of them try to 
get it so fast that you can’t understand them. That’s the difference 
in music between now and the way it was back then. 
There’s not many Christian Harmony singers left. I studied a lot 
about it and it’s a sight how many of the old Christian Harmony 
singers that I knew from around here have gone on. But I hope 
there is a new breed coming on with these workshops and the college 
music classes like Edith Card’s that are doing it right. A lot of people 
enjoy it. But around here the older Christian Harmony singers are 
a dying breed. I don’t care whether anybody sits and listens to me 
or not as long as I enjoy it.

PLATE 77 People gather to express their religion through the fellowship 
of singing. 
"I LOVE TO SING ...” 
Friday night singings, singing schools, and singing conventions 
have long been a part of tradition in this area of northeast Georgia 
and western North Carolina. For many years a group of people 
here in Rabun County who enjoy the fellowship of group singing 
have gathered on Friday evenings throughout the entire year to 
sing together. They meet in homes, or sometimes at a church, to 
sing religious songs. Their songbooks are ordered from various mu¬ 
sic book publishing houses, such as the Tennessee Publishing Com¬ 
pany, the James D. Vaughn Publishing Company and Stamps-Baxter 
Music of the Zondervan Corporation. There are many of these song- 
books published, with book companies bringing out one or more 
a year. Churches and singing groups, like the people who participate 
in the Friday night singings, will order batches of books once or 
twice a year so as to have a variety of new songs to choose from. 
The president of the Friday night singing is responsible for ordering 
the songbooks chosen for that period of time. The participants will 
usually go through two or three different books a year, learning 
almost all the songs in each one. These books are used at the annual 
singing school and at the annual singing convention and then passed 
on to a church or other singing group that can use them. 
Each year in the early spring a singing school is conducted in 
Rabun County. Members of the Friday night singings are present 
and, although the majority of its participants are Baptists from the

area’s different churches, it is open to anyone interested in singing, 
and other denominations are represented. The school is held from 
7 p.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Friday for two weeks and the 
singing school class learns the rudiments of music—the shaped 
notes, timing, and signatures. For the past several years this school 
has been directed by Mr. Hyman Brown from Commerce, Georgia. 
As his “textbook,” Mr. Brown uses Vaughn’s Up-to-Date Rudiments 
and Music Reader. Most of the participants lead songs and frequently 
the young people are asked to come as a group to lead the rest of 
the congregation. Young piano players are called on to play the 
tune in the upper treble along with the pianist. Attendance is good. 
The class is not limited to new students; people young and old 
attend year after year. On the final Friday evening, singers crowd 
the church for a joyous finale. 
In the past, singing schools were ordinarily held in the daytime 
when regular school for the children was not in session and when 
there was a lull in the farming, so that everyone in the community 
could attend if they wished. A person familiar with shaped-note 
music, and with a good singing voice, taught the class. Throughout 
our interviews, favorite singing teachers’ names kept coming up— 
Mr. Johnny Cannon, Mr. Jim Raby, Mr. Tom King, and, today, Mr. 
Hyman Brown.

Counties are organized into singing conventions and each singing 
convention decides the way it wants to conduct its annual singings. 
The Rabun County Annual Singing Convention is held at a local 
church on the first Saturday evening and Sunday in October. A 
business meeting is held at that time; officers are elected and commit¬ 
tees are appointed to carry on the business of the organization for 
the coming year. The officers decide where next year’s convention 
will be held and what they may need to spend money on during 
the year. But more than business is attended to; the real business 
of the convention is to enjoy the fellowship of singing. 
The convention begins on Saturday evening when everyone from 
Rabun County and the surrounding areas who is interested in singing 
gathers at the chosen church to sing for several hours. They recon¬ 
vene Sunday morning at 10 a.m. and sing in lieu of a regular preach¬ 
ing service. A lunchtime they break and set out under the trees a 
wonderful variety of covered dishes of delicious food for a “dinner 
on the grounds.’’ After an hour or two of food and fellowship out¬ 
doors in the fall sunshine, they go back inside the church and sing 
all afternoon. 
The president of the convention calls on a “leader” to direct 
each song. This is a democratic gathering and everyone gets a chance 
to lead. The leader comes to the front of the church, calls out the 
title and number of the song, and everyone sings. Then another

individual is called on to lead. This custom is also found in Christian 
Harmony singing, however in gospel-style singing, an entire class 
from a church will often come up and lead a song. But whether 
the music is led by one or by a dozen, almost always the entire 
gathering of people participate in the singing. 
The list of people we could have talked to about singings and 
singing conventions is a very long one. Several people contributed 
valuable information that has helped us to understand our subject 
better even though we didn’t record our conversations with them. 
Mrs. Agnes Calloway’s memories of her father, Jim Raby, helped 
us to understand the important role singing school teachers played 
in people’s lives prior to radio, television, and easy travel. Mr. Henry 
Fountain, from Toccoa, Georgia, tells of the days when he was called 
a one-man band.” Aunt Addie Norton still sings whenever she 
can get to church or with a group of singers. Lonnie Smith and 
Horace Page were very helpful. These two men were responsible 
for starting the Friday night singings in Rabun County more than 
thirty years ago, and they have been instrumental in keeping the 
singing conventions going in Rabun County. Hyman Brown has 
made us aware that the art of shaped-note singing is still very much 
alive in our community. Esco Pitts directed the choir at the Head 
of Tennessee Baptist Church in Dillard, Georgia, for more than 
fifty years and we enjoyed his recollections of singings and singing 
conventions over such a long span of time. We had fun listening 
to Ernest Watts telling about experiences of his boyhood revolving 
around singings. And we talked with his cousin, Ferd Watts, who 
is also a very active member of the Friday night singings. Our last 
interview was with Wilbur Maney who is the current president of 
the Rabun County Singing Convention. Mr. Maney says that due 
to the influence of his father, Marlor, he has been singing shaped- 
note music “almost since I was born.” Beginning with Lonnie Smith’s 
interview, the final section of this article focuses on music in Rabun 
County.

GOSPEL SHAPED NOTE MUSIC: Jim Raby 
We first heard about Jim Raby from his great-granddaughter, Lynn James, 
a student in the Foxfire class. He was bom in 1885 in western North Carolina 
and became interested in shaped-note singing while still a boy. He died in 
1971 at the age of 88, but Lynn remembers him well. She suggested that we 
ask her grandmother, Mrs. Leon (Agnes) Calloway, to tell us about him. 
Mr. Raby was Mrs. Calloway’s father and she often went with him to singing 
schools and conventions as she was growing up. 
Mr. Raby and his wife had seven children. Mrs. Calloway was bom in 
1918. She went to her first singing school when she was only eight years 
old. She said, “There were only two of the children who weren’t interested 
in singing. We all sang at home and then we went to singings. We took 
part in all of them. We had a pedal organ in the church and Dad had one 
at home. ” 
Mrs. Calloway met her husband when she was about eighteen years old. 
She had gone with her dad to teach a singing school in Highlands which 
Mr. Calloway attended. They ’ve been married since 193 6. While her children 
were small, Mrs. Calloway didn’t attend singings as often as before. As the 
youngest children, Doyle and Gayle, got older, they became interested in music 
and singing the shaped-note songs. 
Mrs. Calloway learned to play on a pedal organ and also used to play 
the piano. Her son, Doyle, plays several stringed instruments but Mrs. Calloway 
says they’ve all “sort of gotten out of attending the singings” like they used 
to. 
In telling us about her father, she said, “Dad lived to be eighty-eight. He 
went to singings most of his life—since he was a teen-ager. They were even 
going on way back then. ” 
Leon Calloway told us this story about visiting at the Rabys’ house one 
time. He and Agnes ’ grandfather, who was in his nineties, were sitting on 
the front porch and the rest of the family were inside. Mr. Calloway told us, 
“I love hound dogs, and he did, too, and we were listening to the dogs run 
on the mountain. ’Bout that time her and her daddy and a bunch of ’em 
got the organ cranked up and they started singing. He said, ‘A ’hem. How 
the heck do they think we can even hear the dogs?’ The Rabys always sang 
when they got together. They all took part. ” 
FROM FOXFIRE MAGAZINE, VOL. 12, NO. 1 
Dad was one of the oldest teachers around here of the old-fash¬ 
ioned shaped-note music. He taught schools in western North Caro¬ 
lina and northern Georgia [and at] nearly all the little churches in 

============================================================

PLATE 83 An old photograph from Mrs. Calloway’s collection showing 
the members of a singing school taught by Jim Raby. 
Macon County, North Carolina. He taught a school near Waynesville 
and one at East Sylva in Jackson County and one at Glenville. 
I went with him to these schools for about ten or fifteen years, 
I guess, and helped him because I could play the organ a little 
bit. He liked to have me with him to help. I didn’t really teach 
but he would get some people started with the letters and notes 
and then he would ask them to sound their notes and compare 
them with the organ. We had a pedal organ. We didn’t have pianos 
in the churches back then. I’d play the notes on the organ and 
see if they were correct, or as near correct as they could get. 
We just had a good time a lot of times. It was a lot of fun. We 
had our papers and pencils and wrote the lines and spaces and 
the times—like % time. It had to be written—how to count your 
notes and the time and everything. This was a very full school be¬ 
cause usually people couldn’t pay for more than ten days. It was 
hard times then, you know, and a ten-day school was pretty long, 
though sometimes, they’d run over a little bit. 
Dad told me that in earlier years, before they got the church 
organ, they had a tuning fork to sound the note with. In a lot of 
places, they didn’t even have that. They just had to use their own

judgment. They’d just sing the best they could and get on key. 
I’ve heard him talk about trying to start a tune at the church at 
Cowee years ago. They asked someone to “heist the tune” and 
this man got it so high they couldn’t sing the song. They had to 
heist the tune a lot of times. 
Dad taught one man how to read and to sing at the same time. 
Then that man went home and made a singing school teacher him¬ 
self. 
My father had decided, when he was about eighteen years old, 
that he wanted to learn to sing. He’d studied and had learned some 
from his father and from other people that sang around the commu¬ 
nity. Then he went to a school in Asheville. I’ve heard him laugh 
and tell about it. I think he walked or hitchhiked a ride to Sylva, 
and then went by train to Asheville. They had a music school there 
for ten days. He didn’t have any money. He stayed with friends. 
He learned what he could and then came back and just helped every¬ 
body around to learn with him. Then he studied further and decided 
he would try teaching. 
He said that he had never found but one person in his teaching 
that could not sing. I asked him what he meant by “could not sing.” 
And he said, “He could not go up and down on the note scale. 
He said his do, re, mi's. He was on the same tone. He never raised 
nor lowered his voice.” He worked with him a long time and Dad 
said there wasn’t any way to get him to sing. 
You were always called on to get up and lead a song at a singing 
school. You could choose your song but you even had to beat your 
time instead of counting in your head. You might be the only one 
keeping the time. You could keep everybody together by their watch¬ 
ing you. 
When Dad was teaching a singing school, he made everybody 
beat that time. He’d show you first what he meant. You had to do 
it that way to keep the time in your mind. He had everybody standing 
up doing that. If it was hard for you to get the words with the 
notes, he would make you read the song, not sing it, but read it 
according to the time, just read the poetry and count the beat in 
your mind. In other words, just read the poem with the notes timed 
to it. And then put your words and notes together. If you would 
do that before you started to sing the notes, you could do a lot 
better. You’d get your words and everything correct. 
My dad went to the state of Washington in 1938 and taught three 
singing schools. They paid his expenses on the train to go there 
and back, and gave a hundred dollars for each school. They asked 
him to come because he knew so many people that had gone there

from here. Some of Mother’s folks were there. He went about March, 
I guess, and stayed the biggest part of the summer and visited and 
taught singing schools. 
Singing schools were provided to improve the music in the church. 
The congregation decided they needed one to help with their singing 
and their music, and they’d call a teacher. It was agreed the church 
would pay so much before the teacher was called. Then the church 
took up a collection. They had the money provided before they’d 
ask the teacher to come. And sometimes the members would mention 
at work or out in the community about the singing school, and 
somebody might say, “Well, I want to give some to that.” They’d 
make a donation to help pay for the teacher coming. The whole 
community participated. 
We usually bought our own songbooks. There might be somebody 
that was representing one of the companies that would have all 
these books and they’d come by and sell a bunch to people. Or 
you could order them from the company and send the money. We 
ordered books from Stamps-Baxter and the Winsett Company in 
Knoxville and the James D. Vaughn Music Company. Theodore Sisk 
and George Seaborn -had music companies, too. 
Almost all the songs in a newly printed songbook are brand new. 
We’ve never seen them before. You learn by singing them over 
and over. That’s the way it’s done. It’s a challenge to you. 
The weekly singings now are usually held at a church, although 
sometimes they’re held in homes. My husband, Leon, and I used 
to go, but we’ve sort of gotten out of it lately. 
The people sing mostly religious songs and of course carols at 
Christmastime. There used to be any number of people interested 
in this type of music, especially those in country churches. 
Dad was a farmer. In early years he had a little country store 
that he and Mama ran. Later on he was in the sawmill business. 
And he was manager of the Farmers’ Federation in Franklin. That’s 
been years ago. They don’t have a Farmers’ Federation anymore. 
Teaching singing was kind of an extra sideline or hobby which he 
liked. He did that on weekends. Or if he had a singing school, he’d 
go and stay ten days. Actually, he taught more during hard times, 
during the Depression, when there wasn’t much work to do. People 
would ask him to come and he didn’t have that much work himself. 
So it was good that he could do that. But that wasn’t his occupation. 
Dad was president of the annual Macon County Singing Conven¬ 
tion for about twenty-five or thirty years. Oscar Corbin was the 
first president that I remember and he died long ago. We usually 
had the convention in July or August. It used to be held for three

days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, sometimes at the old Macon 
County courthouse in the courtroom and sometimes at one of the 
churches. 
The host church would invite the convention to come. Then the 
members of that community would invite the singers to stay in their 
home. Sometimes we had more than a full house. You’d sleep on 
the floor or wherever you could, but it was all a lot of fun. Everybody 
got up and went to the singing and stayed all day and took a covered 
dish or a basket lunch and ate at the church. We enjoyed it very 
much. You think now it’d be an awful hardship to provide food 
for three days for a big crowd, but we enjoyed it then. 
Everybody in the family usually came to the convention. Back 
then we didn’t have much to do except go to church and singings. 
We couldn’t afford to go to movies and things like that. We lived 
so far out, we couldn’t do many things. We went to church and to 
all the community activities. It wasn’t what you’d call a fancy dress- 
up, but we put on something nice like a Sunday dress, just like 
you were going to church. The singings were a very serious thing. 
Everybody took part in the business meeting of the singing conven¬ 
tions. They didn’t bar anybody that wanted to stay. They elected 
a president every year and a vice president and secretary. I don’t 
remember hearing about a treasurer. They met their expenses as 
they came. They had an offering taken for extra expenses, but as 
a rule, the members of the host church bore the burden of it all. 
They didn’t charge anything. The secretary of the convention sent 
out letters to all the churches of the county inviting them to the 
conventions and [announcing] when they’d be. Everybody was in¬ 
vited. They wanted them all to come. 
They still have the annual singing convention, but it’s only one 
day now. It got so big that they divided Macon County into two 
sections back when people began to get transportation. They now 
have a northern and a southern division and they’re held the same 
day. 
They still do have a homecoming at Yellow Mountain Baptist 
Church in Jackson County the first Sunday in October every year. 
And they have this type of singing all day for that. I haven’t been 
to that singing in some time. We used to go to Valley Springs, 
which is near Asheville, for an all-day singing convention. It wouldn’t 
seem like a long ways to go now, but when we went, it was a major 
trip to get there. We went all around in western North Carolina, 
where they were having a convention. We traveled to Swain County, 
North Carolina and went over to Hiawassee, Georgia, several times 
to conventions.

Before I was married, there were two quartets Dad and I sang 
in. We had ol’ man Jess Keener that lived up toward Dillard and 
Olan Graham and Dad and me. Olan came in with the CC [Civil 
Conservation Corps] camps in Franklin and then married a local 
girl and stayed here. He’s a real good singer and makes music, 
plays the piano and organ. That was one quartet. After I married, 
Dad and my two sisters, Mary and Dot, sang in a quartet with Olan 
Graham. We called Olan Graham “Pop.” When we lived in Sylva, 
we had a quartet with Bob Higdon and McKinley Henley. Dad had 
another quartet, “The Hensons,” Tom and Butch Henson and Dad 
and Pop Graham. We [always] went around to different churches 
and sang. 
My daddy was the first person that ever invited a colored [Black] 
quartet near Franklin to come sing for the Fifth Sunday Singing. 
Some of the people [didn’t like their coming but I think they] were 
terribly wrong feeling that way. I really enjoyed hearing them sing. 
And [Dad] had several quartets that came over from the Cherokee 
Indian Reservation. In fact, he taught two or three singing schools 
at Cherokee. We went up to Smokemont, just above the Cherokee 
Reservation, and had a school for ten days in October before Leon 
and I were married. That was before the old Smokemont Church 
was tom down. That’s all in the Smoky Mountain National Park 
now. We had several Indians come up there and sing with us. Horn- 
buckle and Owl and Chief Ross, chief of the Cherokee tribe, and 
Dad had a quartet. 
Dad sang bass in his later years. He said it was easier for him. 
As he got older, he couldn’t breathe as well. As a young man, he 
sang soprano and tenor all the time. As he got older, he could 
still read a lot of songs, but it was getting a bit hard for him. Then 
he fell and was in the hospital a long time. For six months he didn’t 
know anything, but the last thing he ever did was to sit on the 
side of the hospital bed and sing to the nurses. His voice was just 
as clear. It didn’t break. It didn’t crack. And he was eighty-eight 
years old. He was quite a person. 
I wish this interview could have been done when he was living. 
He could have written you a book on singing, because he did love 
his music—loved to teach and loved to help people sing.

GOSPEL SHAPED NOTE MUSIC: Henry Fountain 
Bit Carver talked to Mr. Henry Fountain of Toccoa, Georgia one summer 
afternoon in 1974. He told her some about his life as a banjo and harmonica 
player and how he and his wife and children performed together on a radio 
program and how he had been called a “one-man band. ” He attended many 
of the singing conventions nearby and occasionally went a long distance for 
one. 
We sense that he didn’t think he was an outstanding performer but others 
evidently did, because in subsequent interviews with others, his name kept 
being mentioned. They had wanted us to be sure and talk to him. He can't 
play his banjo anymore due to arthritis, but he still plays his harmonicas 
(he has at least one in every key) with a great deal of spirit and sings along 
with them. 
Mr. Lonnie Smith told us: “He’s a harp [harmonica] player. He hasn’t 
been up here [to Rabun County] in a good while, but he used to go to conventions 
and singings pretty regularly. He ’5 amazing. He's in his eighties and doesn’t 
even have to wear glasses. 
“I never got acquainted with him until about eight or ten years ago. I 
was down in Stephens or Banks County, somewhere down there. He thrilled 
me, because I had never seen him or heard him before. He got up to playing 
his french harp and singing a song. He'd sing all the parts of it; he’d come 
to one part and sing alto, then come to the bass part and sing that. I always 
liked to hear him. It was amazing how he could do it. I guess he’s getting 
old now and can’t sing as much as he used to. ”

We used to go everywhere for singings. I can’t go much like I 
used to. I’m not able to drive anymore. But we used to go to one 
every Friday night and on Sunday, too, for a good while. I’ve been 
to about fourteen different counties for singings. 
I’ve been going to singing conventions for about forty or fifty 
years. The biggest convention ever I was at was the Vaughan Memo¬ 
rial Singing. Old man J. P. Vaughan was a publisher of songbooks, 
and one of the best singers ever been in the world’s history. He 
played his own songs and sang’em himself. Prettiest singing you 
ever heard in your life. Couldn’t nobody beat him. They could be 
a church full of folks singing and if he was a’helping on that song 
you could tell his voice over all that crowd—so smooth, just as 
smooth and pretty. 
I remember a big singing convention up here at Cornelia in 1931. 
It turned out right funny. I picked a banjo then and I carried my 
banjo with me to the convention. I didn’t pick by myself. We had 
a piano and a B flat horn to play with us, and two or three violins. 
There was this book publisher that lived at Lavonia and one of 
the song leaders, he got me to go with them to the convention. 
We got there and the chairman of the singing got up and announced, 
“We have got more leaders here than we can sing in two days to 
save our lives. So we’re gonna sing everyone we can but we’re gonna 
sing the best first.” 
So I figured that let me out. Then way up about the middle of 
the morning on Saturday, he says, “I’m gonna call on this old banjo 
picker here to lead us a lesson.” 
Well, I was surprised—you know, him a’singing all those big songs. 
I got up and led one and you never heard the like in your life! I 
was the only one that day that got an applause. They made the 
house ring. Then we went back on Sunday. Sometime during the 
day, the chairman said, “Now we want this old banjo picker to sing 
another one.” I was surprised! 
What was funny though—me and that book publisher and that 
other feller was coming on back home and he says, “I didn’t much 
like it today. I carried my new songbook up there and they didn’t 
give me much chance to sing.” 
I said, “Well, you heard what the man said yesterday, didn’t you? 
‘We’re gonna sing the best!’ ” 
That tickled that feller to death that was with us. Of course, I 
just pulled it as a joke, you know. But it sure did turn out good. 
I don’t know round note music but I know the shaped notes. If 
it’s in shaped notes, I can play it. Our family played on one of the 
first radio stations ever in Toccoa, Georgia. And then at one time

I was playing with another band outside my family. It was called 
the Battle Ax Bill Concert Family. I’ve got a harp holder and I 
used to play the banjo and harp together. 
They used to have me sing “Rocking on the Waves” everywhere 
I went. They called me a one-man quartet. I’d play my harmonica 
and sing all the parts too. They had a tent meeting over there in 
South Carolina and I sang it one night for them. Then they made 
me sing it four nights in a stretch. 
I’ve always liked to attend the Friday night singings at folks’ homes. 
I can’t go much now unless somebody takes me, though. You never 
saw such crowds! They really sing! You ought to listen at it! Then 
after the singings, the folks say, “Don’t y’all leave now. We’re gonna 
have something to eat.” They go on in there and have a good sup¬ 
per—all kinds of good food, coffee, and soft drinks. We just have 
a wonderful time!

GOSPEL SHAPED NOTE MUSIC: 
Aunt Addie Norton 
Mrs. Leon Calloway and several others who talked with us about shaped- 
note singing asked if we’d talked to Aunt Addie Norton about her singing. 
She had not made much mention of it in the interviews we’d taped for the 
personality article we’d done about her “Aunt Addie Norton,” volume io, 
number 3, Fall, 1976. It was from a statement by Aunt Addie that this 
section got its name. She finds happiness in singing, even when things aren’t 
going well for her and she made the remark several times in our conversations, 
“I love to sing. ”

Everybody came together at the annual singing convention for 
Macon County [North Carolina]. All the churches met together and 
they sang. Our choir would sing. If we had quartets in the choir, 
they would sing. People from Coweeta and all the other churches 
around here and people from Jackson County, North Carolina and 
everywhere, they’d come here to this singing convention. Mr. Jim 
Raby was the most wonderful man for singings that’s ever been in 
Macon County. [He was the president of the singing convention 
for a long time.] 
These conventions would be in different churches in the county. 
People would travel in wagons, buggies, and on horseback. There

was always a committee appointed to take care of the singers that 
lived too far away to go home at night. They provided them a place 
to stay in different homes in the community. Their food and bed 
and also feed for the horses was furnished free. Now that was a 
time everybody had a good time and such wonderful singing and 
such beautiful Christian fellowship with everybody. There was lunch 
provided for everyone all three days of the convention. Sometimes 
the women of the host church would get very nervous wondering 
if they would have food enough to go around but there always 
seemed to be plenty. 
We’d get up wagons, buggies, or whatever—fill’em full—and lots 
of folks would ride horseback. They’d tie up the horses somewhere 
away from the church—come for three days—and it was \yonderful, 
honey! When the children were little, I took them if they wanted 
to go. But after they got bigger, they didn’t care too much about 
it. 
At our singings, we had quartets come from different communities 
and then the congregation would sing. In Georgia, they may have 
a few quartets to sing at the singing convention but usually they 
have people who lead the songs, who stand in front and start a 
song. Then another person is called on to lead one. 
In North Carolina, we have leaders at the singing conventions, 
too as well as quartets. And sometimes the entire class from a church 
will come up front and sing. I’ve seen’em gathered up front maybe 
fifteen or twenty. They’d sing and everybody else would listen. Then 
another class would get up and sing. Usually they had one person 
as leader. 
You know, I wanted my children to sing so badly and I’ve not 
got but one that’s took after Mama—my baby, Neville. Oh, how 
he loves to sing! He doesn’t know a thing about shaped notes but 
he loves to sing. And he loves to sing country music, too. He likes 
that very well. He used to pick a guitar all the time. He doesn’t 
have much time to do that now and he’s not got anybody to play 
with him. He used to have a little band of music—guitar and violin 
and all things like that. When he was about three or so, I took 
him to church and he always sat in my lap or down by me. I sang 
alto all the time and you know, honey, he’d sit there and listen to 
me singing it over one time and he’d take that tune with me next 
time just as good as I did and sing it just exactly right. I don’t 
guess he was over three or four years old till he could sing alto 
just as good as I could. 
Some people was kind of bashful when they got up front to lead

a song. I never was. I’ve sung several solos and my knees would 
get kind of shaky the first time or two I went up there but I never 
was very nervous about things like that. A lot of people are but 
I m not. If I make a mistake, it doesn’t bother me anymore. Used 
to it did, because Mr. Holt [our singing leader] would get on to 
us if we made a mistake and I was afraid of him as I could be. 
[Aunt Addie laughs.] I told him one time, “Mr. Holt, do you know 
what? I used to be afraid of you.” 
He said, “What was you afraid of me for?” 
I said, “I didn’t know but what you was going to knock me down 
a few times for missing the notes.” 
He just laughed. 
I can’t remember when I started singing. I’ve sung all my life. 
My father was as good a bass singer as I think I’ve ever heard. If 
God gave me a talent, it was for singing. And I love it, honey. I 
have never been as near heaven of anything else in my life as I 
have at a singing. It’s the most glorious, wonderful experience— 
anybody that loves to sing, anybody that has a talent to sing! It 
was special to me, and it is yet. 
Singing has always been more sacred to me than anything in the 
world, honey. I don’t know why. They’s nothing in the world that 
bothers your mind if you love to sing. You’re just as happy and as 
free as you can be if you’re singing a good gospel song. I love it. 
I’ve taught the young’uns a lot—young people down here at Calvary 
Church and over here at Newman Chapel. We used to have singings 
over at Calvary every Friday night at the church. I used to belong 
over there, but now I belong to the Newman Chapel. 
I can sing any song I want to, unless it’s too complicated. And I 
can sing that, too, if I look over it long enough, even if it is compli¬ 
cated. I can sing all four parts, every part in the book. I love to 
sing tenor most. If the piano player only played by sound [couldn’t 
read the music], I’d sing it over to them till they learned the song 
and then I’d teach the other parts to the other ones and I had the 
most wonderful little choirs you’ve ever seen over there in just a 
little while. When they’d first commence singing, they didn’t know 
a thing in the world about it and they’d make more mistakes. They’d 
just keep making mistakes and I’d get it out of’em. 
I can’t sing any songs with the round notes. I know the shaped- 
notes’ sound, time value and everything like that and I can’t read 
the round notes at all. I didn’t try to learn the lines or spaces much 
because that’s for the piano, the musician. Sometimes I have to 
look over a new song two or three times before I can get the time

right. I value the notes. If you don’t know the valuation of these 
notes—the three-quarters and the whole notes and the half notes— 
you get mixed up. They teach all that in the singing schools. I can 
pick up a new songbook and look through it and run over the 
notes and learn the songs. I just love to. I can’t keep my foot still 
to save my life when I’m a’listening or when I’m singing a song. I 
keep time with my foot. 
I know a lot of people don’t love music like I do but it’s just so 
wonderful, just an inspiration. It’s hard to believe, though, that they 
could not love it. I can’t see why. I never heard but one or two 
people, though, say that they didn’t love gospel music. How anybody 
could hate that beautiful spirit that’s in the song, I can’t understand. 
You know, I don’t listen much to the tune of the song. It’s the 
words that gets me. 
We had an organ at home. I never seen a piano till I was a great 
big girl. I don’t know how old I was. The churches always had an 
organ. You know, an organ goes way back. And it’s beautiful yet. 
But I love a piano for singing better than I do an organ. 
If John Holt had a dozen pianos and organs, too, he had his 
tuning fork and he’d listen to that first. Then he’d tell them what 
key it was if the piano player didn’t know. A lot of times, the piano 
player plays by ear. Mr. Holt had that tuning fork in his pocket all 
the time. I’ve sung lots of times without any [piano or organ] music 
in people’s houses where we’d go and sing. 
Tom King, John Holt, and Jim Raby all stand out in my mind 
more than anyone else as singing school teachers. When I was fifteen 
or sixteen years old, we had a singing school in Persimmon commu¬ 
nity and Mr. King was our teacher. It lasted about two weeks and 
helped us young people a lot. We learned the shape and sound of 
the notes. 
After I was married in 1910, I came to North Carolina and joined 
the church at Newman Chapel where Mr. Holt was our singing leader 
in church. Like Mr. King, he was a wonderful singer and a good 
teacher. We would go from church to church and sing. There would 
be all day singings where classes from different churches would 
gather and sing. 
Mr. Raby was one of the most wonderful men I’ve ever seen in 
my life. He was a wonderful teacher! He taught over here at Newman 
Chapel one time. I had three children when I went to singing school 
over there to him. And I learned more, of course, because I was 
older. I put my mind to it and tried to learn. Of the schools that I 
went to when I was a girl, I done more courtin’ than I did singing, 

============================================================

THE TRADITION OF SHAPED-NOTE MUSIC 317 
you know. Mr. Raby did more for Macon County in singing than 
any one man that’s ever been in this county. I know. I’ve been 
here and went with him. He started the fifth Sunday singing in Macon 
County. It’s about faded out by now, I think, since he died. He 
kept it up as long as he lived. I’ve seen that courthouse [at Franklin] 
down there just as full as it’d hold. I never hear much about the 
fifth Sunday singings anymore. I don’t know whether they still have 
them or not, but if they do, they only have a half day of it now— 
commences a little after twelve and people sing all Sunday afternoon. 
I think we moved back here in 1926, and I knew Mr. Raby then. 
I knew him for years. He was one of the best singing instructors 
around and he held singing together. He kept up all the singings 
and everything. He arranged them. We certainly lost one of the 
best singers and best teachers that’s ever been in Macon County 
when we lost Jim Raby. He was good to everybody. He treated 
people all just alike and if you could learn to sing, if you had singing 
in you, he’d learn you how. All of Mr. Raby’s children are good 
singers. I never helped Mr. Raby with a singing school. I just went 
and tried to learn myself. I’ve went with him to a lot of singings. 
I’ve been with him and sung for him many a’time down at Franklin. 
Mr. Raby was one wonderful person. I thought a lot of him. He’s 
been in my home many times. 
Also, I had a quartet of my own. There was Margaret Holbrooks 
Sanders, Margaret Carpenter, Donna Ledford, and me. Then we 
got down to a trio. We sang over the radio every Sunday morning 
for a long time. 
I do hope and pray that people will carry on good gospel singing 
until Jesus comes back to gather His children home. Won’t it be 
wonderful to sing in heaven with all those good singers who have 
gone on before? I want to be in that number!

I was born here in Rabun County. Then we moved to Anderson, 
South Carolina, and lived there about three years. Then we moved 
back here and I’ve been here ever since except for a period from 
about 1918 to 1926. 
I attended singing schools and learned the shaped notes and the 
timing back when I was a boy. All my friends went, teenage boys. 
The school lasted ten days to two weeks—about the same as now. 
I didn’t go to any singing conventions then, but we had an all¬ 
day singing sometimes at the church and that was fun to me even 
though I didn’t take any active part in it. All-day singing and dinner 
on the ground, but, lots of times, it was more like all-day dinner. 
I wouldn’t sing; I’d just go. I had taken part in the singing school 
and learned my notes, but still I was stubborn about singing in 
church. I just sat in the audience. My mother was there but I usually 
sat with my friends. She insisted on me going to church whenever 
I was big enough for any activity, whatever was going on. And she 
saw to it that every Sunday morning, my little brother and I went 
to Sunday school. I can remember those little knee pants and waist- 
ies, and that’s the way she dressed us. She saw that we went and 
that’s the way I came up. I was raised up to go to church and I 
haven’t forgot it. 
[As I grew up,] I got away from singing. I never took up singing 
much publicly until I was grown and had several children. My chil¬ 
dren could sing and I reckon I was gifted to it, at least a little. My 
mother was a good singer and I suppose I inherited it some way 
or other.

THE TRADITION OF SHAPED-NOTE MUSIC 319 
My oldest daughter was big enough to play the organ before I 
took a real interest in singing. To tell the truth, I never really was 
a Christian until I was thirty years old. I was united with the church 
here at Chechero when I was about fourteen. I’ve always gone to 
church, but I didn’t completely understand. When my first boy was 
bom, that changed my life completely, because I had always heard 
it said, “Like father, like son,” and I was doing things that I didn’t 
want my boy to do. 
And when [I began to understand the real meaning of being a 
Christian,] I became more interested in gospel singing. I was thirty 
years old then and I’m seventy-four now. That’s been a long time! 
What happened was Mr. John Cannon was teaching a singing 
school at our church. He was from Wolf Creek over near where 
Horace Page lives. At that time I was making crossties and I had 
split my foot open and I couldn’t work. I didn’t have anything else 
to do but go out there and listen to them. 
I went and Mr. Cannon put me to work just as soon as I got 
there. He got to teaching me the notes and the time and one thing 
and another. I caught on pretty fast, so after the singing school 
was over, I was very much interested in singing. I went to Wolf 
Creek to an all-day singing and he called on me to get up and 
lead a song and I thought I’d fall down. I thought I’d tear my book 
up shaking, you know, but he insisted that I get up and lead a 
number and I did. From then on, why, I’ve been trying to sing. 
That’s been nearly forty years ago. 
I never could learn about line and space music. I know how it 
goes, but not fast enough to read it. The shaped notes aren’t any 
problem. I could leam the different shape of the notes easier than 
I could learn the location. Once you leam to sing the scale, you 
can sound that note when you see it, no matter if it’s halfway down 
in the scale. 
It’s amazing and I don’t know how I can do it, but I can look at 
the notes, at the music, and at the words all at the same time. We 
leam it by practice. If you don’t sing a song right, if you miss a 
note, it’ll sure tell on you. The rhyme’s right, the rhythm’s right, 
and the time’s right if you don’t miss a note. It’s not too awful 
difficult, but I’ll say this, I don’t know near as much about it as 
I’d like to know. 
People come from all over Rabun County for the Friday night 
singing, and also from Stephens County, Habersham County, and 
Towns County, from Oconee County, South Carolina, and Macon 
County, North Carolina. The Friday night singings have been going 
on for more than thirty years that I know of. It started with a group

up around Clayton, Mr. Larry McClure and his wife—they were 
two good singers—and Walter Ramey and the Silborn Family. Then 
Horace Page and I participated. It just kept a’growing. One time 
we had the singing out here at our church (instead of someone’s 
house) and we had a rule that whatever church the singing went 
to, the director of the singing in that church presided that night 
over the group. I was singing director and that night the church 
was full and we sang twenty-seven leaders.

PLATE 89 Future singers at 
the Friday night singing enjoy 
the fellowship, too. 
Sometimes we have better turnouts and better singing than at 
other times. We have several piano players and at least one comes 
every time. My daughter plays sometimes. She’s a good pianist. On 
occasion we’ve had a man from Towns County bring his guitar. 
Both he and his sister play. Sometimes he picks his guitar when 
class is singing, but usually we sing to piano. 
I’ve been president of this Friday night singing for about four 
years, off and on, but my health’s so bad here lately that I haven’t 
always felt like going. I’ve got emphysema and my breath’s too short 
a lot of times. I do sing some yet, but there are so many times 
that I can’t go and feel good. Last Friday night I got the group to 
elect another man. We put it off on Wilbur Maney for a while. 
The president decides on different song leaders for the meetings. 
Everybody decides where the meeting will be the next time. Someone 
calls for it in their home or at their church and we go there. 
We’ve just received some new songbooks and we took them down 
to Doug Ivie’s home in Habersham County and I’ll declare, I’ve 
never been to a better singing in my life! None of us had ever 
seen those songs before. I didn’t sing any at all, but sat back and 
listened to the rest of them and it was just like they’d had that 
book for a year. 
We buy three different songbooks every year, one each from the 
Tennessee Publishing Company, the James D. Vaughn, and the 
Stamps-Baxter Book Company. We’ll buy one hundred copies of 
one of the books and we’ll sing out of that one all year; then we’ll 
use those next year at the Rabun County Annual Singing Conven¬ 
tion. About June we’ll order fifty copies of another one of these 
books, and in December we’ll get fifty copies of a book put out by 
the other company. This gives us a good variety of songs to sing. 
Song books are getting mighty expensive now. We take an offering 
every Friday night at our singings. We’ve been pretty fortunate in 
having enough money to pay for the books so far.

When the singings are held at home, everybody brings refresh¬ 
ments. We don’t usually have food [if we meet] at the church, except 
on the Friday night at the close of a singing school. In a home, 
we have refreshments when we get through singing and chew the 
fat and visit around with each other. It’s mighty good to get with 
people and associate with them. You’re all friends and you [get a 
chance] to talk with them. It’s worth something there. 
1976 was the ninety-first year for the Rabun County Singing Con¬ 
vention. It was held at Wolffork Baptist Church in October. When 
the county convention was first organized, it consisted of three 
days—Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, or it may have been from 
Thursday through Saturday. But these last few years—the whole 
world’s got to streamlining everything and cutting corners—it’s got 
down to Saturday night and Sunday. People are living so fast now 
and they have so many different places that they go, they just don’t 
seem to be as interested in the convention as they used to be. A 
lot of the old people have passed on and there are mighty few 
young people that are interested in it. 
One of the duties of the convention president is to call the singing 
together. [The president of the Rabun County Singing Convention 
and the president of the Friday night singings are not necessarily 
or usually the same person.] As I’ve already said, they’ve got to 
streamlining this thing and they’re leaving off a lot of stuff in these 
last few years. Now when I was president of the convention, it was 
a little more difficult than it is today.

There are about six delegates sent from each [participating] 
church—supposed to be both male and female—and they carry the 
letter from their church. The secretary of the convention has the 
responsibility of writing up the minutes of each convention and 
that person has the minutes printed up and sent out to each church.

The convention has a constitution and by-laws. We have a finance 
committee. Contributions are sent in from all the participating 
churches and the expenses of the convention are covered by this 
money. It’s used for printing the minutes and then if there’s a funeral 
[some member of the convention], we use some of it for buying 
flowers. Then we have a committee to decide on where the next 
year’s convention will take place and a nominating committee to 
recommend the nominations for the next year’s officers—president, 
vice president, chaplain, and secretary-treasurer. 
The singing schools usually do pay for themselves [through the 
participants’ contributions] but we have used some of the convention 
money to pay for them sometimes, if need be. Our church here 
will contribute to it even if they don’t send anybody to the singing 
school that time. Hyman Brown taught our singing school this year 
at the Battle Branch Baptist Church and plans to hold one there 
next year. He has one up here in Rabun County each year. 
The Rabun County Singing Convention is not limited to the Bap¬ 
tist church. We have a lot of other people that are interested in 
singing and they all support the convention and the singings and 
singing schools.

I ve been going to our Rabun County Friday night singings for 
about thirty-five years regular as I can. They are pretty organized. 
We have a set time to start, seven-thirty every Friday evening. We 
elect a president and a secretary. The president usually starts off 
the singings. We have an opening prayer and then go right into 
singing. The president leads the first song and then he calls on 
somebody else to lead the next one and he sits down. Why, even 
the youngest members get up and lead the songs. We have a nine 
year old granddaughter and she does it just like it was nothing. 
There are a lot of kids who go to our singings and they like it so 
much they keep coming. They usually go to singing school so they 
know every note and the time to the songs just as well as the adults. 
The music we have is mostly religious. When we have a singing, 
we use a piano or sometimes an organ if it’s available. When Mr. 
Henry Fountain from Toccoa comes over, he plays the harmonica 
for us to sing by. We always manage to have at least one piano 
player but sometimes a lot of the folks can play. 
There’s usually a pretty good number of people who attend our 
singings. It depends a lot on where it’s being held. Sometimes we 
hold the meetings in someone’s home and have refreshments after¬ 
wards. We have pretty good turnouts to this sort of singing. 
It hasn’t been too long since we had a singing here at our house. 
There were sixty people here that night. There was hardly a place 
to put them. They were hanging out the windows and doors. If 
you want to come to a singing, it’s as much yours as it is ours. 
You are always welcome to come anytime. It helps for somebody 
who’s interested to come. They may not learn all the notes but 
just them trying will give others the will power to come. 
We have people coming all the way from Young Harris, Georgia, 
to our singings. One family with a grown son came and he met a 
girl who came regularly. They started dating and got married at a 
singing. The last night of our singing school that year, they pulled 
this preacher over to one side and whispered some things back 
and forth. Pretty soon they went outside down below the church 
and got married right there. In a few minutes they came back inside 
just like nothing had happened. 
We buy our own songbooks with voluntary contributions. Then 
each week, the president brings them to wherever the singing is

being held. Every book we get has different songs than the last 
one. People write the songs and send them to a publishing company 
to be put into a book. We get two new books a year, one in January 
and one in June. The old books that we no longer use are donated 
to a church or some other group that wants them.

so enjoyable. I guess I like’em too well.

The old music teacher we had [growing up] used to get up at 
the [singing] school and tell everybody that a man couldn’t milk 
the cow at our farm if he didn’t go to the bam singing. If he didn’t 
sing, the cow would leave. I learned about singings when I was a 
child. I was the twelfth of thirteen children, eleven boys and two 
girls, and we all sang. 
All my family sings. Both my sons write songs now. And one is 
teaching shaped notes. He really enjoys it. The family doesn’t get 
to go to all the singings with me but they do if they can. My wife 
plays the piano. She was brought up in this kind of thing, too. As 
a matter of fact, we did most of our courting at singings. That’s 
where a lot of kids used to go on their dates. 
There’s not as much interest in singings as there used to be. 
There are some singings that have spread out West but I think 
they are different than here. The interest in shaped-note singings 
is mainly concentrated in the South.

I’ve taught singing schools since about 1961.1 keep teaching most 
of the year. I take time off in November and December and some 
in the summer. In August, I sing at our home revival. 
[Mr. Brown writes songs, too.] A song will come to you just like 
a thought. Most of the time, I just write the music.

GOSPEL SHAPED NOTE MUSIC:

I’ve always liked music all my life and I like everybody that makes 
it. My first recollection of music was my granddaddy. He was a 
singer. He was always the first one in the church and he had a 
certain seat up there next to the “amen comer.” I never did see 
anybody else sit in his seat. When he’d get in the church, he’d lay 
his head back and close his eyes and go to singing. You could hear 
him for about a half mile. He would sing until everyone would get 
in the church and the preacher was in the pulpit. As the people 
would come in, they’d join him in the song service. I never saw 
him sing out of a book in my life. He knew all the songs by heart. 
They were all religious songs like “Amazing Grace” and “What a 
Friend We Have In Jesus” and that old song, “Over the River.” 
I can’t remember all of them. Grandma would go to church with him, 
but she’d sit back a pew or two. 
He was a preacher—he wasn’t ordained but he could really preach. 
And he was a good Christian. He was just a happy man wherever 
he went and he made people happy that he got with. I’ve seen 
him get into the pulpit and take away the sermon from the preacher. 
He’d go to preaching and he’d come down the aisle, shaking hands 
with the people while he preached. He didn’t stay in one place. 
And pray! I’ve heard him pray in my sleep many a time. 
He and another man, old Uncle Sam Taylor, a good Christian 
man, would run revival meetings around all over the county. Uncle 

============================================================

THE TRADITION OF SHAPED-NOTE MUSIC 
331 
Sam didn’t know a letter in the book—he couldn’t read or even 
write his name. Grandpa taught him the scripture by heart and he 
would get in the pulpit and quote the scripture to beat the band 
and preach and pray. And Grandpa would lead the singing. 
They wouldn’t take money for their preaching. One time they 
went over to Hale Ridge and ran a two week meeting over there. 
When they got through, the congregation made up thirty dollars 
and gave [it to] them. Grandpa said, “You just take this and give 
it to somebody that needs it.” He said, “We’ve got a living at home.” 
And he wouldn’t have the money. 
We lived about two and a half miles from our church and my 
mother carried us to church every Sunday from the time we were 
born. She’d carry a quilt and put it down on the floor and lay us 
down on the quilt when we were tiny kids. That was at Mountain 
Grove Baptist Church up in the Germany settlement. I was raised 
. up there in the Blue Ridge. 
My mother had an awful sweet voice and my daddy could sing. 
My oldest sister sang alto and my next sister sang soprano. I tell 
you, they could really sing! 
We smaller children went to bed pretty early. There was no elec¬ 
tricity then and the [grown folks] would sit around the fireplace 
and sing. I’d go to sleep listening to them sing. I don’t know of 
anybody that could sing any sweeter. They’d sing old songs like 
“Ninety and Nine.” I heard them sing that many a night. 
We’d have visitors come and I remember an uncle who’d come. 
He was a good Christian man and he could pray a good, long prayer. 
They’d all sing and then have prayer. 
As I got a little older, my sisters would let me go with them on 
weekend nights to singings in homes in our community. By the 
time I was about twelve years old, I was being called on to lead a 
song at the conventions. We made a whole day of it when we had 
a singing convention. I just sung by ear then—I didn’t know the 
notes. Then when I was about thirteen, I was sitting at the breakfast 
table one morning and I told Mother I wanted her to teach me 
the notes. She got the songbook down and taught me the shaped 
notes right there at the breakfast table and from that day to this 
day I’ve known them. All we had were shaped notes then. We never 
saw round notes. 
Then a little while after that we had a singing school there in 
Wolffork. A man from Clarkesville came up and taught it for ten 
days. He was James P. P. Franklin, a most lovable character. He 
knew his music! I went every day. My sisters and all the young 
folks in the community would go. Mr. Franklin had a big blackboard 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
332 
and he’d write the music scale down just like it was in the book 
the staff and signatures and everything. I’d just sit there and drink 
it in. I loved it so much. He found out I could lead songs and he 
made me lead some of the songs and I’ve been leading ever since. 
From then on, I could sing the notes of any song that was written 
in shaped notes. 
I’ve never conducted a singing school myself. I sort of wanted 
to, but I was busy at something else. I always had a job working 
at something. 
[Getting together for a singing was our way of dating and socializ¬ 
ing when I was a boy.] If anybody had a wagon and mules, we’d 
load up on that and go to someone’s home in the settlement. If 
we didn’t go in the wagon, we’d all get together and walk. We all 
had our sweethearts, and we’d each get with our girl and march 
down the road. We didn’t have electric lights, so we sang by kerosene 
lamps. And most of the homes didn’t have any musical instruments, 
so we sang without music. And lots of times we would have a candy 
drawing at the singing. 
There wasn’t much dancing where I was raised up because the 
old folks didn’t believe in it. Now and then in certain places, they 
didn’t care, but I never danced while I was young until I left home. 
I do remember two men who played [dance music]. One played 
the violin and the other picked a banjo. They could make awful 
good music and we would go and listen to them play. We wouldn’t 
dance, just sat around and listened, but it was dancing music, not 
religious music. 
When I was fourteen, I came to the Rabun Gap School. Dr. [An¬ 
drew] Ritchie, a native of Rabun County who’d graduated from Har¬ 
vard University and taught at Baylor, came back here and started 
a school to get all the mountain children into high school. The 
children could come from the surrounding countryside and work 
their way through school. They didn’t have money, you know. There 
wasn’t any money in those days. I worked my way through that 
school, all the way from beginning to end. Then I was hired by 
the school after I graduated and worked for them for thirty years. 
We always had opening exercises every morning at school—devo¬ 
tion, scripture reading and sang a couple of songs. Leora Grist played 
the organ and I would lead the singing. We would have a good 
song service every morning at the beginning of school. 
When Sunday came, Dr. Ritchie would have all of us students 
to go wherever the church services were being held—one Sunday 
at the Methodist church and next Sunday at the Baptist. All of us

boys and girls would walk in a body from the school right up the 
railroad [tracks] to the church. 
I led the singing at church right from that time [when I was a 
young man]. They appointed me songleader at that [Head of Ten¬ 
nessee Baptist] church way back yonder in 1910 or 1911 and I led 
the songs there till about four years ago. Carrie Dillard Grist was 
the pianist and organist. She could play! Boy! I’m telling you, I’ve 
never seen anybody that could beat her in playing! She and I had 
charge of music for the church over there for right at fifty years. 
I’d go over to her house in the evenings and she would play and 
I would sing—we’d learn all the songs in any new songbooks as 
we got them. We’d sing for two or three hours a night. 
I remember the annual Rabun County Singing Convention from 
way back before World War I. It’s always held in the fall of the 
year. I hardly ever miss one unless I’m sick or something like that. 
They used to hold it at the courthouse some years, but most of 
the time it was held at a church. At the close of the singing convention 
each year, the president would give all the churches that were repre¬ 
sented an opportunity to say they’d like the convention to be at 
their church the next year. A certain church was decided on and 
it was announced right then where the next year’s convention would 
be. It went right on round and round to all the different churches 
different years. 
I remember the first singing convention I went to. It was at a 
church at Powell Gap. The church is gone now and there are trees 
big enough for saw logs growing right where that church was. The 
convention was held on Saturday and Sunday. Everybody would 
take dinner both days—have dinner on the ground. We all went 
home on Saturday night, then came back on Sunday. People would 
go in their buggies and on their horses and those close enough 
would walk. There was generally a houseful. When the convention 
was held at the courthouse in Clayton, it would be just crammed— 
just standing room. 
The old man that organized the first singing convention away 
back yonder was Mr. Tom King. He had three boys that could lead 
singing and he could lead himself. And every church in the county 
would send a song leader, or maybe two, to the convention. 
One president of our singing convention Was Martin Chastain. 
He was the school superintendent and he was a wonderful speaker. 
He loved music. Between songs he’d quote scripture and poetry. 
Do you remember “Song of the Chattahoochee”? He’d quote that 
or poetry by Longfellow. He was an emotional kind of fellow but

everybody loved him. Then Johnny Cannon was a president. He 
could sing and he was a good song leader. He had a daughter that 
could really play the piano. 
Singing’s been my life. [I consider it] a gift. If I couldn’t sing, I 
don’t know what I would have done. I love singing so much and 
I’ve loved everybody that made music.

When I was about twelve to fourteen years old, I went to my 
first singing school at Liberty Church. We lived about a mile and 
a half out from Tiger, Georgia. Mr. Johnny Cannon taught that 
singing school. He’d ride a mule or come in a buggy. It was for a 
week or maybe two weeks and the singing school was held in the 
daytime. It was in the middle of the summer so we weren’t having 
school then. The adults came, too. They didn’t have too much work 
to do about then. It’d be in the middle of July, between corn laying- 
by and fodder cutting time. I’d been to singings all my life but 
that was my first singing school. 
My daddy would order a dozen or two of those songbooks— 
everybody would chip in and buy, you know. This family would 
buy two or three, another family would buy two or three. Daddy 
would get four for us. He’d order them from some company through 
the mail. We used Vaughn’s book and Stamps-Baxter quartet books 
and we used some good songs in them. We never did have organized 
quartets. We had a quartet of our own at home but we never were 
organized; we’d just sing. I sang bass and both my sisters sang alto 
and played the organ or piano. Back then we had a pump organ 
just like the one over at the church. 
We had a good singing class at church. All the young people 
were interested about the time they got about fifteen or sixteen 
years old. We had a choir and we’d take those gospel songbooks 
and it wouldn’t be but a couple of weeks before we’d know most 
of the songs in them to sing them.

PLATE 105 Dinner on the grounds. 
I remember once going to a singing convention over at Boiling 
Springs. My father and I rode the mules from Liberty across Davis 
Gap and Timpson Creek. There were trails all through the mountains 
back then. There was a trail that went across the mountain there 
into where John Wilburn’s store’s at. Then we rode the roads from 
there to Boiling Springs. 
When dinner came, why we had dinner on the ground, instead 
of putting the food on benches or tables. They always said “singing 
and dinner on the ground” but they generally put the dinner up 
on the table. That was the first and only time that I ever had dinner 
spread out on the ground like that. 
For the dinner at all-day singings, people would generally bring 
chicken and ham and I have known people to bring barbecued goat 
or stewed goat. And nowadays, some bring steak. Back then you 
hardly ever had any steak because nobody ever killed any beef. They 
killed hogs and had pork chops and spare ribs. 
And, of course, they had all kinds of cakes. I remember once 
they had a singing school down at Chechero. There was several 
of us boys, seventeen or eighteen years old then, who went the 
last day for the dinner. There was a Mr. Smith who took us in a 
truck down there. We carried a great big old black cake, chocolate 
cake. One of the boys cut a piece out of it and I got a piece. It 
was just as dark as it could be on the inside. I ate mine. I watched 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
338 
that other boy. He just held his piece. Directly, he throwed it out 
down the hill. I said, “What did you do with that cake? 
He said, “I was afraid that thing was poison. I was afraid to eat 
it.” It was a rye cake, made with rye flour. It was good! I laughed 
at him for years about throwing that cake away. It didn’t look right 
to him. People used to cook a lot with rye flour. 
Once we boys and girls decided we’d have a singing up at Mr. 
Jeff Holcomb’s. There were two places we could go for a singing. 
We’d have a good singing for about thirty minutes or an hour. 
And we’d always slip the old banjo with us and the guitar and after 
a little while we’d get around and ask the people of the house if 
we could dance a bit. They’d say, “Yeah-h-h, all right.” So we’d 
get the fellows around and get the banjo and the guitar, and start 
the music. Sometimes we’d have a fiddle. We’d dance an hour and 
a half or two hours and have a good time and go back home as if 
nothing had ever happened. 
Then in about three or four weeks, we had another place we 
could go to—Doc Dickerson’s. We had new books a lot of times 
and we’d learn the new songs in a week or two. We’d sing like 
everything for about an hour. Then we’d slip around and ask Doc 
if we could dance a little bit. He’d say, “Yes-s-s, I guess, if your 
daddy and mammy don’t find out, it’ll be all right.” So we’d dance 
about an hour and a half. We always had to get in home before 
twelve o’clock. 
We went to serenading one time. We never sang when we were 
serenading. I don’t know how it got the name “serenading.” They 
sing Christmas carols now but we didn’t back then. We’d just holler 
and hoot. We never did play no dirty tricks on anybody. If they 
didn’t treat us right, we just went on. 
There was snow on the ground and it was pretty cold. We went 
up by Liberty [Church] and we serenaded Mr. and Mrs. Jim Callen- 
back and it just tickled them to death. They were old and us young 
people went in and talked with them and they treated us [to refresh¬ 
ments]. We went on up the road to the Dave Crunkletons’ and 
serenaded them; then we went on up to Lester Brown’s. They always 
treated us. We all had firecrackers and we’d shoot’em. Lots of times 
I’d start to light one and if somebody’d already lit one, I’d throw 
mine anyhow. I didn’t want it to go off in my fingers! Sometimes 
we’d ring a bell—we had an old cowbell. Just made a racket, a big 
racket! We hardly ever carried a shotgun because we were afraid 
somebody’d get shot. We’d just carry firecrackers. 
We went on up to Mr. Isaac Brown’s. He was about sixty-five or 
seyenty years old. We asked him if he wanted to go with us and 

============================================================

he said, Yeah, I’ll go with you.” He was a spry old man. He could 
get about. We went on up to Mr. Jesse Carnes’, then Mr. Mark 
Carnes , then on to old man Blyth Carnes’. Then we came on back 
to Liberty Church. This happened to be a New Year’s Eve we were 
serenading on. We decided we’d ring the old year out and the new 
year in. We sat around till about midnight. Then come twelve o’clock 
and we rang the church bell for thirty minutes. Then we took off— 
went home! 
The singing conventions used to be held in the old courthouse 
in Clayton. It s torn down now but they were held in the big court¬ 
house upstairs the first Sunday in October and the Friday and Satur¬ 
day before. They’d carry a piano in. Now it’s still [held] the first 
Sunday in October, but just Saturday night and Sunday. 
It changed because I guess people just have too much to do. 
They got to where they didn’t come on Fridays. Then they’d do 
• their business on Saturday and it got to where nobody came on 
Saturday and they’d have to have it just on Saturday night and Sun¬ 
day. One time we had the convention down there in the gymnasium 
in Clayton but it wasn’t good, ’cause it was too big. It echoed. You’ve 
got to have a building that’s right for singings. They had it at the 
Tiger schoolhouse one time and once at the Persimmon school- 
house. But most of the time now, they have ’em in the churches. 
The first president of the Rabun County convention I remember 
was Mr. Martin Chastain. If someone got up to sing, why Mr. Chas¬ 
tain would have something to say. He’d tell about Ben Franklin or 
Abraham Lincoln or Thomas Edison or he’d quote some poem about 
something until the man would kind of get himself together, get 
over his stagefright. Then he’d tell the song and they would sing 
it. He was a soft-spoken fellow. Had a mustache. Everybody loved 
him. He was a good convention man. 
Mr. Johnny Cannon was the president of the convention the year 
they held it in the Clayton gymnasium. People from all parts of 
the country would come—from Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, 
Tennessee, and North Carolina. They would come to ours and then 
people in Rabun County would return the visits to help them with 
their singings. 
Hyman Brown of Banks County has some of the best singings 
I’ve ever been too. When you go to one of his singings, you act 
as if you were in church. If you start talking, he’ll call you down 
and tell you to go on outside if you want to talk. [He’ll say,] “We 
are singing to the glory of God. We’re not singing just to show 
ourselves.”

When Ferd Watts is called on to lead a song, he always gets up patting 
his foot and shaking his finger asking if we’re ready to go. He’s a very good 
bass singer and a long time member of the Rabun County Friday night singings. 
He has participated in singing schools and singing conventions in Rabun 
County most of his life. 
FROM FOXFIRE MAGAZINE, VOL. 12, NO. 1 
I was about ten years old when I went to my first singing school. 
That was up at Liberty Baptist Church and Johnny Cannon was 
the music director. It lasted for about two weeks. I went there the 
same time as [my cousin,] Ernest. The singing school was held along 
in July when we were out of school. I’m about the only one in my 
immediate family that’s stayed with singing, but we could all sing. 
I can remember the Rabun County Annual Singing Convention 
being held in the courthouse at Clayton. That’s when I was about 
eight or nine years old. We went in a wagon. You didn’t see any 
cars then. Everything closed up so that everyone could come to 
the singing. It was held on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday back then. 
At the Sunday service, there wasn’t any preaching and anybody that 
wanted to could come. The courthouse was full and the Sunday 
service started at ten and went until about four in the afternoon. 
There wasn’t any singing at night—-just all day. 
Just loving to sing encouraged us to get the Friday night singings 
started back in the thirties. I was president of that for about six 
years. I sing bass. I do lead some singing but not too much. Class 
singing is what we do mostly, but we have some specials. Class 
singing is when the whole group sings together with someone up

of people think that they should lead a song if they come to a singing. 
At the singings, we sing and we socialize together. I think that 
everyone who comes to the singings have the same feelings—it’s a 
spiritual time. I hope the singings will continue. 
You never quit learning music and I try to attend Hyman Brown’s 
singing schools now. He keeps bringing up stuff that he thought 
we might know and might have forgotten. And there’s usually some¬ 
thing that I haven’t learned before. Hyman says he learns something 
new every day. 
Singing is certainly a part of my religion. There’s as much in 
the Bible about this kind of singing as any other kind. When you 
think of it, the Bible speaks of hymns as much as any other kind 
of singing. In fact, the better the singing, the better .the preaching 
you will have. If you want a dull preaching, just have you a dull 
singing.

GOSPEL SHAPED NOTE MUSIC: 
Wilbur Maney 
I’m fifty-three years old and my daddy, Marlor Maney, was teaching 
shaped notes to me when I was born! My dad is eighty-three years 
old and I’d say he’s been singing them for nearly seventy years. 
The shaped notes that I sing haven’t deviated; these are the same 
type that they were singing fifty years ago. My dad kept a few of 
those old songbooks put out by Henson, and one or two more of 
those publishers and this type of singing hasn’t changed other than 
the new songbooks that come out. 
Now I am not that good, but my dad can just hear these things 
in his head; he doesn’t need a piano to pitch a song. He can just 
look at the key of it and he can hear it in his head. He still goes 
to shaped-note singings although he doesn’t sing as much anymore. 
I never have written any songs either. I couldn’t write one if I wanted 
to. That’s a special need of people—and I believe in gospel singing 
or anything else—that the Lord just reveals it to you. I don’t care 
whether it’s a popular song or whatever; I just believe the Lord 
gives it to you. 
I devote two hours to shaped-note singing at our Friday night 
singings every week and as much as six hours on a weekend this 
fall going to various singing conventions around. For example, we’ll 
be in Banks County this Saturday and Sunday; we’ll have our [Rabun 
County] convention at Liberty Baptist Church the first Saturday and 
Sunday in October; we’ll be in White County the second Sunday

and then maybe New Bridge in Gainesville the first Sunday in No¬

in November. That will kindly play it out until we start over in 
the spring. 
My wife, Ouida, and my daughters, Debbie and Ruth, sing shaped 
notes. My wife and two girls sing alto and I sing bass. We’ve taken 
them to singing schools. They’re good! Even if they are my daugh¬ 
ters, they’re good. My daughter, Debbie, who is in the eleventh 
grade, sings alto just about as good as anybody in these mountains. 
She can stand up with anybody, I don’t care who’s leading or how 
hard the song is. She can sing. She’s been to about five or six of 
these singing schools. 
I’ve been president of the Rabun County singing convention for 
two years. This year we will have it down at Liberty Baptist Church 
and my job is to make sure the convention runs smoothly. A lot

dominates it. This convention will convene [as most conventions 
do] on Saturday night at seven-thirty. I’ll probably call on the officers 
[of the convention] to lead the first song. This is customary and it 
kicks it off. We then have a chaplain that will have a prayer and 
the minute he gets through, we have the first leader right on the 
floor to lead a song. And right before he announces his selection, 
we’ll tell the next leader to be ready to follow. If you got a lot of 
leaders, you have to keep pushing them and telling them to keep 
their remarks short. Nobody came there to give a speech. They 
can hear a speech anywhere anytime. They came to sing. You may

have to remind them a half a dozen times—there are people that 
just love to talk. But most of these people have been coming to 
these singings a long time and they understand these things. If we 
have thirty leaders, we sing thirty songs, so time is very important. 
We start again at ten-thirty on the following Sunday morning. 
They don’t have church, but we do ask their preacher to give a 
devotional. We sing awhile and have a big dinner there on the 
grounds for an hour. Then we go back and sing until we get through 
all the leaders that have come. Now the leaders that have led in 
the morning don’t lead again in the afternoon—we don’t double 
back in the afternoon.

Everybody that wants to gets to lead one song. Sometimes at 
these other county conventions, my two girls and I get up and lead 
together. They may call on each one of them, Debbie or Ruth, to 
lead one and they will call their own number. Let me say here that 
the leader should start [a song]. The piano should not start it. Now 
you can go to some of these churches around here and the piano 
will start out and the leader will then go in. You go to one of these 
shaped-note singings and those piano players will sit there all day 
if the leader doesn’t go ahead and start the song. They’ve got to 
hit that note and get it pitched right. Then the minute the leader 
hits it, they go with it. But those piano players will sit there all 
day if the leader doesn’t start it. They’re not going to start it for 
you. They follow. 
A leader better know a half a dozen songs or more that he can 
sing before he goes. If you’re way on down [the list and don’t get 
called upon until late in the afternoon] you better know a good 
number [of songs] in those books. If you go at ten o’clock and 
there’s about forty leaders there, you don’t know when you’ll be 
called upon or how many songs will be sung. And we try never to 
sing the same song. If you get up and announce one they’ve already 
sung, they’ll call you—they’ll tell you. Most people can remember 
what’s been sung. 
Shaped-note singing is good fellowship. My girls know people 
from [singings] all over this side of the state. People do it for the 
fellowship; they get a real blessing out of it. They’ve been doing 
it all of their lives and it’s a part of their lives and has real religious 
significance. I myself like it for the religious experience and the 
fellowship. We have a big time together.

BAPTISM 
By Paul F. Gillespie 
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; 
but he that believeth not shall be damned. 
—Mark 16:16 
B 
apdsm is the symbolic 
reenactment of Jesus’ 
immersion in the River 
Jordan by John the Baptist. The southern Protestant denominations 
assign varying degrees of importance to baptism. To some, baptism 
is a visual testimony of conversion to the belief in Jesus Christ as 
savior; to others, such as members of the Church of Christ, it is a 
criteria for remission of sins, forgiveness, rebirth, and eventual ad¬ 
mission into the heavenly kingdom. 
Baptism may take the form of sprinkling, pouring, or total immer¬ 
sion. The ritual may be performed during the regular Sunday morn¬ 
ing worship service or during a special service usually held on Sunday 
afternoon. A special baptism service may follow a week-long church 
school in which converts are instructed in the dogma of that denomi¬ 
nation. Baptism service may also be held during or following a re¬ 
vival. 
Today many of the denominations that practice baptism by immer¬ 
sion use a baptismal pool in the church. These pools resemble small, 
heated swimming pools, roughly five to six feet long, four to five 
feet wide, and three to four feet deep. However, many preachers 
and church members believe that the service should be performed 
in a creek or lake without regard to time of year or weather condi¬ 
tions. As preacher Joe Bishop says, “I baptized over here at Mountain 
Grove, on the pond there at old man Adams’ mill. It froze and 
the water poured over there and there were icicles hanging down 
there as big as your leg. I’d baptize at twenty below just as quick— 
no difference to me. He called me to do the job; I’ll do the job 
and leave the rest up to Him.”

FOOT WASHING 
By Keith Head and Wendy Guyaux 
During the course of our in¬ 
terviews with Reverend 
Ben Cook, we were ex¬ 
tremely interested in his account of the foot washing that was regularly practiced 
within his church. Since Reverend Cook had been so cordial and receptive to 
us during those interviews, we carefully approached him asking permission 
to record such a service for our study of different aspects of mountain religion. 
' Reverend Cook understood our sincerity in reporting these philosophies and 
practices and expressed the possibility of our bringing tape recorders and 
cameras into this special service. He offered to bring request before the new 
preacher and the Board of Deacons the next week. After an anxious week, 
he brought us word that we were more than welcome to document this service. 
Right at six o’clock on the fifth and last Sunday in July, the bell 
at the little country church began to toll signaling the start of the 
evening church service which would include observance of the Lord’s 
Supper and the foot washing. Members of the church found their 
places and the choir assembled at the front of the church. The service 
was begun with the singing of several old favorites including, “More, 
More About Jesus,’’ “Rock of Ages, Hide Thou Me,” and “I Heard 
My Savior Speak to Me.” A member of the church then got up, 
made several announcements and welcomed everyone to the service. 
He then asked the ushers to come to the front of the church and 
gave the offertory prayer: 
Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee again for this privilege 
to call upon Thee, Father. We thank Thee, our Father, that 
You saved our souls one time, Father, that You’ve been with 
us, Lord, through this life, Father. Our Father, we thank Thee, 
Lord, for this little church and we thank Thee for the service 
that You are about to let us go into tonight, Father. Lead us 
and guide us and forgive us of our sins and bless the collection, 
Father. These favors we ask in Jesus’ name. Amen.

FOOT WASHING 
353 
After this prayer, the offering was taken while the choir sang an¬ 
other old Baptist favorite, “Power in the Blood.” During the last 
chorus of the last verse, Reverend Paul Carden, Jr., made his way 
to the front of the church and upon the completion of the song, 
he started his introduction: 
It’s good to have each one of you with us tonight. We want 
to welcome these visitors [from Foxfire] and we pray tonight 
that each one has come, one mind and one heart and one accord. 
I feel this is one of the most sacred services we can have— 
our Lord s Supper and foot washing. I want us to remember 
the full purpose of why we are assembled at New Hope tonight; 
and most of all, let’s keep Jesus at the center of all of it and 
realize He is still the Head of this church and all of our churches 
in our own association and all across the country. So let’s re¬ 
member tonight that we need to exalt Jesus above everything. 
We need to remember that He is the One who founded the 
church, He is the One we need to talk about and He is the 
One we need to do things for. 
Following the opening remarks, a call was given by Reverend 
Carden to remember the sick. A prayer meeting, held in a sick mem¬ 
ber’s home earlier that afternoon, was discussed and members com¬ 
mented upon the good spirit evident at that visit. Reverend Carden 
reiterated these comments: 
A good number of us were there and we appreciate everyone 
that went. We received, I feel, a great blessing from it. He’s 
been sick quite a while and when you see a man enjoying some- ' 
thing like that, it’s quite a blessing. He’s not able to go to church 
and it’s the church’s duty to go to those who are not able to 
come out. Seeing him receive such a blessing made every minute 
worth it. We want to continue to remember him and others 
who are sick. 
After these comments, everyone assembled around the altar at 
the front of the church for prayer. Reverend Ben Cook led the 
prayer and then each person simultaneously prayed his or her own 
prayer aloud for several minutes. After the prayer, a hymn, “Victory 
in Jesus,” was sung and there was a time of fellowship as church 
members and visitors mingled around through the church, shaking 
hands and greeting each other. 
Reverend Carden then called for personal testimonies. He invited 
anyone to stand up and say “a few words” concerning his or her 
religious experience or spiritual way of life. One person stood and

said simply, “I’d like to say I’m real happy to be a Christian.” Another 
followed and in front of the entire congregation, shared her feelings: 
I’d like to say I know the Lord and I’m not ashamed to stand 
up for Him because one day He’s not going to be ashamed 
for me. And I’m so thankful for the many blessings I have, 
and I’m glad I was raised up in a place where I was taught 
about the Lord because there are so many people that don’t 
know about the Lord. They’ve grown up not ever having known 
about Him. I’m just thankful for this and I want to do God’s 
will. 
After a period of quiet and a time of personal reflection that 
followed these testimonies, the mood seemed perfect for the sermon 
and Reverend Carden began to talk about the purpose and signifi¬ 
cance of the Lord’s Supper and foot washing: 
We want to know tonight, before we partake of the things 
God would have us to partake of, what we’re actually doing. 
We spoke this morning on Christianity and we want to continue 
tonight to keep in mind what a Christian is. One of the four 
things I mentioned this morning on what a Christian is was 
being Christlike or like Christ. So as we read in this passage 
of scripture tonight I want us to see some of the things Christ 
did. He set a supreme example for us to follow and there is 
nowhere in the scripture that it leads us astray or leads us off 

============================================================

on a detour from the highway that leads to heaven. We want 
to realize tonight that Jesus did set the example that we need 
to follow, did the things that we need to practice in our own 
day and time even though we are almost two thousand years 
later than when He was when He walked upon the face of the 
earth. But yet, even today, Jesus Christ still walks with us through 
the Holy Spirit and I feel things should be just as orderly today 
as they were two thousand years ago. So, follow along with 
me starting with the twenty-third verse of the eleventh chapter 
of I Corinthians. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading 
of His Word: 
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered 
unto you. That the Lord Jesus the same night in which He 
was betrayed took bread; And when He had given thanks, He 
brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is My Body, which is broken 
for you: this do in remembrance of Me. After the same manner 
also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying, This cup 
is the new testament in My Blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink 
it, in remembrance of Me. For as often as ye eat this bread, 
and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till He come. 
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup 
of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood 
of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him 
eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth 
and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him¬ 
self, not discerning the Lord’s body. 
[/ Corinthians 11:23-29] 
We want to speak for a few moments. We’ll not speak too awful 
long tonight, but there is a few things in this passage of scripture 
that we need to look at and see what the Lord Jesus did for us. 
That night as He began to break bread and sup from that cup— 
and to see just exactly what we need to do tonight, to see just 
exactly what kind of example we’re following and what kind of exam¬ 
ple Jesus laid down for us almost two thousand years ago. 
Let’s go back for a few moments. I’ve got about five things out 
of this passage that I want us to look at and take heed of what 
Jesus Christ is telling us and what He is trying to give us out of 
this passage of scripture. Frrst of all, let’s look back at verse twenty- 
three and we’ll find Christ’s incarnation. You know, Jesus came into 
this world just as human as we are today, but yet He came as being 
the supreme sacrifice for us and the supreme example—one particu- 

============================================================
PAGE 358

FOXFIRE 7 
356 
lar way that we ourselves and the only way tonight that we can 
find our name written in the Lamb’s Book of Life and the only 
way we can inherit the Kingdom of God tonight is through Jesus 
Christ. 
We find in Romans 8:3 that He did come to this world in the 
likeness of sinful flesh. I never said sinful flesh. I said in the likeness 
of it. He had no sin. There was no sin about Jesus Christ. This is 
the reason that He could say as we partake of the bread and wine 
that we are partaking of His body—something that is not sinful. 
Something that is pure, something that man can let enter into his 
body as being a part of Jesus Christ. Something that is perfect. 
We find in Philippians 2:7 that “He made Himself of no reputation 
when He took upon Himself the form of a servant.” Let’s look back 
a moment as Jesus Christ came into this world. You know, many 
of the Jews and others were looking for Him to come as a king, 
One to set upon a throne and One to have a crown setting upon 
His head. We find that He was born in a stable amongst the animals 
and we find He came merely as a servant. He came as a plain ordinary 
person and we would think of Him today as human form, but we 
know from the scripture He was indeed the King of Kings, the Lord 
of Lords and One that could set at the table that night as the disciples 
were gathered around Him and say, “Yes, this is My body” and 
“Yes, this is My blood of the New Testament which you are about 
to partake of.” Now as we partake of the Lord’s Supper I want us 
to stay in full remembrance of exactly what the bread stands for 
and exactly what the wine stands for and realize that even though 
we are not setting around the same table as those disciples did 
nearly two thousand years ago, and even though Jesus is not right 
here with us in the person and the flesh, it’s still as sacred tonight 
as it was there in that upper room. We need to realize tonight as 
we gather here to partake of the Lord’s Supper that we need to 
be in full reverence of the Lord Jesus Christ. There may be some 
here tonight that will deny Jesus. There may be some here tonight 
that will be in the same shape Judas was in: They’ll come into God’s 
house and they’ll partake of the things God would have them to 
do, even as Judas did that night, but yet they’ll depart and they’ll 
begin to betray our Lord Jesus Christ. But Jesus came to this earth 
not to make a reputation for Himself, not to set upon a throne, 
not to make everyone bow down, but He came as the poorest of 
the poor where people would take Him upon faith, where people 
would follow Him by the leadership of God. 
Then we go on down in these verses and we see Jesus’ devotion. 
Christ was a devoted man. If He hadn’t been He’d a never hung 

============================================================

FOOT WASHING

up on the cross for us. It says, ‘The Lord Jesus the same night in 
which he was betrayed took bread,” and it goes on in the twenty- 
fourth verse, “and when He had given thanks He broke it.” When 
He had given thanks. Jesus Himself. He never looked over and said, 
Judas, would you bless this for us? Judas, would you pray over 
this meal for us?” The scripture said, Jesus Christ Himself gave 
thanks that night. What was He giving thanks for? What did the 
symbol of breaking bread mean? It was the meaning of the breaking 
of His own body. He gave thanks to the Father because His own 
physical body was going to have to be broken—because it was going 
to have to hang upon the cross and those precious drops of blood 
were going to have to flow out of Him for the redemption of myself 
and you and all the people as long as time lasts here upon earth. 
And if you don’t believe that, rather than take of the Lord’s Supper, 
you ought to bow in this altar and ask forgiveness from God. Begin 
to ask God to show you the way, the way you ought to lead your 
life. Jesus, through His devotion, said, “not My will be done, but 
Thy will be done.” The Father’s will be done in this. Jesus did 
not want any glory from it all even though He was God in the 
flesh and He would receive the glory such as we glorify Him tonight. 
He was to do the Father’s will and be about His Father’s business. 
And as we’re gathered here tonight, we need to be about the 
Father’s business in our Lord’s Supper and our foot washing. We 
need to realize that these are things Jesus did and if Jesus was here 
tonight, I wonder how many people would be here in New Hope 
Baptist Church. I would venture to say we’d have to roll the windows 
on out and they’d be out here in the yard. They’d be out in the 
parking lot in chairs. But brothers and sisters, He’s just as much 
here tonight as if He was here in the flesh. He’s just as much here 
in the spirit tonight as He was that day in the flesh. People don’t 
realize that it is the same Jesus that’s with us tonight that walked 
bn the earth two thousand years ago. Brothers, we need to realize 
that that Jesus is the One that died for us, standing at the Right 
Hand of God making intercession for our sins. And every one of 
us has sinned against God. I don’t care who you are or how close 
you walk to Him, you’re going to sin against Him and Jesus stands 
at the Right Hand of God making intercession for us. He’s still 
devoted. Still devoted. 
You know, when we have the Lord’s Supper, our churches ought 
to be running over. When we gather together to worship the Lord 
Jesus Christ, our churches ought to be running over. But people 
don’t realize today the pain and the agony and the suffering Jesus 
went through where we can live in a nation like we live in today.

this and we can’t do that. We ought to fall down on our knees 
and thank God tonight that He put us in a place where we have 
the freedom to stand to proclaim the Word of God, to stand and 
do the things Jesus Christ did. 
Another thing we need to look at is the invitation that Jesus Christ 
gives. Always giving man an invitation. Always offering man some¬ 
thing. He said, “take and eat.” He said, “Here it is. It’s yours if 
you want it.” But then, it gives a few qualifications for those that 
eat and those that don’t eat. He goes on down in the scripture 
and says, “But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of 
that bread and drink of that cup.” Now you’ve heard me speak on 
self-examination I know and Jesus wants every one of us to examine 
our own lives and find out if we’re worthy to take of this bread 
and this cup. He said if you drink of it unworthily then you’re drink¬ 
ing damnation in your own life. You are making a mockery of God. 
He said to let a man examine his own self—personal examination. 
I cannot stand behind this pulpit and say this one and that one 
and the other one is all that’s allowed to come up here tonight. 
All that I can say for tonight is for myself. The only person I can 
examine tonight is me. It’s between you and Jesus and you know 
whether you’re worthy or not. It says, “For he that eateth and drink- 
eth unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.”

I want us to look for a moment before we go any further into 
this service and see if we’re worthy to partake of the Lord’s Supper. 
You know, this is a serious moment. This is a serious time in our 
lives. If you’ve never been saved, if you’ve never accepted Christ 
as your own personal Savior, then you don’t need to partake of 
the Lord s Supper. If you do, you are eating and drinking damnation 
upon yourself. But if you’re here tonight and you’ve accepted Jesus 
Christ as your own personal Savior, it is your obligation to the Father 
to partake of the Son’s body and do it in remembrance of Him. 
Not to do it for ourselves or anybody else but in remembrance of 
Jesus Christ Himself. I want us to make sure we stand worthy before 
God tonight. 
One other thing I want to say tonight. I want us to turn our 
minds to the thirteenth chapter of John. The Bible says, “And after 
supper, Jesus girded a towel about Him, took water in a basin and 
began to wash the disciples’ feet.” Now I don’t know how many 
here tonight believes in foot washing. That doesn’t bother me. My 
convictions are between me and the Lord Jesus Christ. But let me 
tell you something. The £ible says a Christian is Christlike—being 
like Jesus Christ. The Bible says, “after supper He girded a towel 
about Him and took a basin of water and began to wash the disciples’ 
feet.” Now you can participate in the foot washing tonight if you 
want to or you don’t have to and I’ll not say one word because 
that’s between you and God. I’m no judge. But I tell you right 
now the greatest time I’ve ever had in my life was when I put my 
bare feet in that pan of water. The only time I’ve ever shouted to 
victory in my life is when I sat down on this pew and I got my 
feet wet and the Spirit filled me so much I couldn’t stand it. And 
if you’ve never had this experience, you shed those shoes and socks 
and you put your feet in the water and do it to praise the Kingdom 
of God—not to tell people you participated in a foot washing but 
because you want to and God tells you you need to. You are going 
to get one of the greatest blessings out of it that you’ve ever had 
in your life! I got a blessing seeing this young lady saved here this 
morning. I got a blessing out of the revival that run that length of 
time. But I also get a great blessing by putting my feet in that pan 
of water and knowing that I was doing it because Jesus Christ Himself 
had humbled Himself enough to get down upon His knees and 
take a towel and gird it about Him and take those disciples’ feet 
and bow down before them, put them in that water and wash them. 
And, brother, I’m no better than Jesus Christ is and you’re no better 
than Jesus Christ is and I’m going to bow down on my knees tonight 
and I’m going to wash people’s feet. Jesus did it and I’m no better

and I’m going to do it too. I’m sinning when I don’t do it and 
I’m wrong against God. 
And you say, “Well, you’ve not done it all your life.” No, I haven’t. 
This is the only church I’ve ever been in that had foot washing. I 
didn’t know what it was! I dreaded it! I was scared to death the 
first night we had foot washing. We came to church and I said, 
“What are we going to do?” 
They said, “Do the same thing everybody else does.” I got wound 
up a little bit better than everyone else did one night and I’m not 
ashamed of it either. I’d like to see the windows fall out here tonight, 
people shouting and stomping the floors. Praising the name ofjesus! 
Let us pray: 
Our Father and Lord, we thank Thee for the service tonight. 
Father, as we go further in this service, as we begin to partake 
of the Lord’s Supper, God, we want to do it in remembrance 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. We want to show the world that yes 
we are still a Christian people, that yes we are still Christlike, 
yes we’re still Christlike, yes we’re still willing to follow the 
example that our Lord sat down for us two thousand years 
ago. Lord, bless each one here tonight, God, and God, may

ask it. Amen.

THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE UP 
« 
SERPENTS 
By Elliot Wigginton 
“Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field 
which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, 
Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden.” 
—Genesis 3:1 
This chapter began with an invitation to witness and record a series of 
religous services that few journalists have been allowed to see—much less record. 
We thought it was important that we accept, not only because of the unique 
nature of such churches, but also because of the amount of rumor and myth 
and misunderstanding surrounding them. We had been led to believe, for exam¬ 
ple, that the serpents used were either rubber dummies or had had their fangs 
pulled. We can now lay both of those rumors to rest. Rubber rattlesnakes 
don’t sing and strike at the tops of their cage and the preachers that have 
been bitten and have died weren 7 gummed to death. 
From the beginning, we were asked not to reveal the location of this mountain 
church and, as is our policy, we have adhered to that. We were not restricted 
in any way from our recording, however; Karen Cox, David Wilson, and 
Gary Warfield, the students who covered three homecoming services in August, 
were given totally free rein to work inside the church with cameras and videotape 
and tape recorders. It was a display of generosity on the part of the congregation 
that dumfounded me. And the students worked more intensely and more closely 
as a team than I had ever seen them do before. David was so intent on 
getting photographs from the very center of the activity that at one point, 
eye glued to the viewfinder, he swung his camera around right into the side 
of a giant rattler. A photograph we missed: the expression on Karen!s face 
when she was offered a copperhead. 
Our involvement with the church spanned several visits over a nine-month 
period—the time it took us to get what we felt was a fair portrayal. During 
the first visit, we attended three separate services and interviewed a number 
of people outside the context of the meetings. On the last visit, I took Ernest 
Flanagan, Tom Carlton, and Randall Hardy solely to interview the preacher 
and members of the congregation. We wanted it all to be as accurate as possible 
and, on the last visit, we even carried every photograph that we had planned 
to use with us to have them checked and approved for publication.

But always the feeling of all of us was that it was going to be impossible 
to get this one down on paper. For even if we could rig it so that when you 
opened this section, you were flooded with the noise and the songs, and at 
the same time rig it so that the photographs all swirled simultaneously around 
you as their subjects did around us, there would still be the immensely complicated 
intricacy of a style of worship that varied with each service and took place 
not only from the pulpit, but from every comer of a three-dimensional room. 
It’s lost on the flat pages of this silent book. What remains is an echo. 
So how do we proceed? To include the entire texts of five-hour services 
would be nearly impossible. On Saturday night, for example, the following 
took place in this order: four sermons in a row, the last from a man in the 
congregation; a request for prayer for a hospitalized woman; singing, combined 
with people coming to the altar; loud music and serpent handling; another 
sermon; three women and then three men giving testimony in random order; 
a girl singing a solo and then testifying; a woman and then two more men 
testifying; a man asking prayers for his sick wife; a woman testifying; more 
singing; requests for prayer for a boy, a woman going into surgery, and another 
boy; and then dismissal late that night. And that was just Saturday. 
So what we’ve done is try to combine the two major services, group the 
types of events, and give you a sampling of each type from pieces of sermon 
and testimony from various people, through photographs of serpent handling 
and healing and speaking in tongues; and give them to you in some sort of 
order, knowing full well that most of the services lack that tidy order. 
So remember that the events flow naturally into, and combine with, each 
other without the fragmentation we have imposed. Beyond this flaw, we’ve 
tried to tell it straight to the best of our ability. None of us was in a position 
to accurately judge what was happening. All of us are human beings trying 
to find our own place in the maze of religious beliefs and strike our own 
balance. We will not judge this church except to say that despite the fact we 
will probably never handle serpents, each of us found this a church of incredible 
strengths, of tremendous energy and honesty and of total commitment to God 
and to the congregation. It is not a church of talk, but of action so dynamic 
that beside it, more conventional forms of worship seem stale and lifeless. 
It was an experience none of us will forget.

Afterward He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and 
upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because 
they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen. 
And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the 
gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall 
be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these 
signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they cast 
out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up 
serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; 
they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. So then 
after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up into 
heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. And they went forth 
and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirm¬ 
ing the Word with signs following. Amen.

PLATE 148 “Believin’ is part 
of th’faith. If you don’t believe, 
you can’t do this. See, it says, 
‘These signs shall follow them

believes. 
“I can’t understand why 
th’people can’t see it. Right there 
it is in th’Bible. You boys ought’a 
read that and study that so’s you 
can teach that and say, ‘now

all th’time. Other churches won’t

Won’t let’cha come in with it. 
They just won’t allow it at all.” 
—Reverend Browning 
In 1909, the preceding verses from St. Mark so struck George 
Went Hensley that, so the story goes, he chased down a rattler, 
held a meeting of his neighbors, and handled it and passed it among 
them. No one was bitten and the movement was launched. Hensley 
himself, after supposedly being bitten 446 times, finally died of the 
447th at the age of 75 during a meeting in an abandoned blacksmith 
shop outside Altha, Florida. Refusing to allow anyone to call a doc¬ 
tor, he died belching blood and writhing on the floor according 
to the eyewitness report of Don Kimsey, an Atlanta Journal corre¬ 
spondent [Atlanta Journal, January 8, 1973: p. 9D]. 
Since that time, numerous others have died of either the same 
causes, or of drinking poison; despite that, and despite the fact 
that the practice is outlawed in most states, the movement that Hens¬ 
ley founded—though largely underground—is still very much alive. 
The church we visited—the location of which, at the request of

the preacher, must remain nameless—was founded in 1931. Two 
years after its founding, the members began to handle serpents. 
As the preacher, Reverend Browning, tells it: “I was thirty-four years 
old. Th’Lord called me t’preach this. He began t’reveal th’faith t’me. 
It was through th’revelation of Him. 
“It was revealed t’me in this Bible when it said t’take’em up; and 
I was preachin’ one day and I didn’t know that verse was to us. I 
thought it was to th’Apostles. And th’Lord revealed it t’me, and 
then I got t’preachin’ it. And they brought one one time and said, 
‘Can we bring it in?’ 
“And somebody said, ‘Yeah, bring it in.’ 

============================================================
PAGE 377
============================================================

THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE UP SERPENTS 375 
“And they said, ‘Th’preacher’ll have t’tell us.’ And I went out 
to’em and hollered to’em t’bring it in.” 
They’ve been bringing it in ever since. 
Though their church is a Church of God, it is only one of a number 
of wings of that denomination, a denomination that takes its name 
from Acts 20:28 [Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all 
the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to 
feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own 
blood]. The name is also mentioned in I Corinthians 1:2, II Corinthi¬ 
ans 1:1 and 10:32, Galatians 1:13,1 Thessalonians 2:14, and II Thes- 
salonians 1:4. Browning’s particular sect, subtitled the “Apostle 
Doctrine,” differs in some respects from the other Churches of 
God—to Browning’s dismay. Of the Church of Christ, for example, 
he says, “If you’re the father and he’s the son, what’s yours is his 
and what’s his is yours; and if it’s a Church of God, it’s a Church 
of Christ. Church of Christ, it’s a Church of God. But the Church 
of Christ don’t teach the Holy Ghost like I teach it—that you speak 
in tongues. They won’t have that. They teach all you have to do 
to be saved is be baptized and that gets you to heaven.” 
For Browning and his followers, there is only one church, and 
only one set of doctrines to follow. The foundation for that faith 
is found in what they consider the most important books of the 
Bible: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts. Of these, the most 
important is Acts. As Browning says, “That’s the beginning of the 
new plan. This is like a door into a church. This is a door book. 
You can read all of th’old Bible [Old Testament] and it don’t tell 
you how to get in th’church. This is th’book that tells you how 
t’get in th’church. This is th’last words He said t’them, ‘And, when 
He had spoken these things, while they beheld it, He was taken 
up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.’ They weren’t but 
eleven of them there, but they choose another’n in this chapter. 
And he was numbered with th’eleven apostles. 
“Acts is th’most important of all. That’s when He built th’church. 
In th’sixteenth chapter of Matthew, He said, ‘Upon this rock will I 
build my church, but He never built it till He died. He had t’give 
His life for th’church. This twentieth chapter here in Acts said that 
He purchased it with His own blood. There ain’t nary another book 
like this.” 
And of the guidelines laid down in those five books, the keystone— 
and the belief that sets this sect apart from the others—is the rigid 
adherence to the idea of the spiritual “gift.” From baptism and 

============================================================

PLATE 150 
anointing, the faithful must proceed to prove their faith by having 
“victory” over snakes, fire, poison, or all of these. Then, in a moment 
of supreme ecstasy, they receive a “blessing” from the Holy Ghost, 
Himself, and subsequent gifts, which are proof that they have been 
blessed and rewarded for their untarnished devotion. These gifts, 
elaborated upon later, are such things as spiritual knowledge, the 
ability to prophesy, the gift of discerning spirits, and the speaking 
in tongues. Until the member of the congregation has reached this 
plateau, he is still damned. 
It is on this point that Browning is often challenged; but his de¬ 
fense is that though it does not say specifically in the Bible that 
one must speak in tongues, it does say that when the apostles re¬ 
ceived the Holy Ghost, they did; and when the twelve received the 
Holy Ghost, they did, and on and on through example after example. 
And that’s good enough for him. 
One of the touchstones concerning gifts is found in I Corinthians. 
Though it implies that not all the members of the church must 
speak in tongues [“for no matter what their gifts, they are all of 
the same body and all vital parts of each other”], it is still a touch-

stone, and a verse he points to often when outlining the gifts with 
which the faithful are rewarded: 
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you 
ignorant. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto 
these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you 
to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth 
Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, 
but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts, but 
the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, 
but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but 
it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation 
of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one 
is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word 
of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same 
Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to 
another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to an¬ 
other discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; 
to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh 
that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally 
as he will. For as the body is one, and hath many members, 
and all the members of that one body, being many, are one 
body: so also is Christ. 
—I Corinthians 12:1-12 
Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular. And 
God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily 
prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts pf heal¬ 
ings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 
—I Corinthians 12:27,28 
Just as important in the minds of Browning and his flock as the 
striving for a blessing is the solidarity and indivisibility of the group. 
Enough Bible verses warn that outside elements will try to tear them 
apart to demand that they give this full attention: 
Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over 
the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed 
the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 
For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves 
enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own 
selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away 
disciples after them. 
—Acts 20:28-30

I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called 
you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not 
another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert 
the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, 
preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have 
preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, 
so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto 
you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. 
—Galatians 1:6-9 
There is only one church, and it must be safeguarded. The result 
of this belief is a closing of the ranks. If a member strays, everything 
possible must be done to bring him back to the fold. And if he 
steadfastly refuses to return, he must be damned and avoided. 
Browning repeats this, citing scripture: 
“[If we’ve received the Word and not accepted it] then we’ve 
turned it down. Now this is what you must preach—what He give 
these men. And you go to th’last of these four books. They don’t 
mean you can’t talk on these others, but the doctrine they preached 
must be preached. Now listen at this man talk after he come in— 
have you read the ninth chapter of Acts where this man, Saul, was 
a’persecudn’ th’church? The Lord spoke to him, said, Saul, Saul, 
why persecutist thou me? Now he’uz a strong Pharisee. And had 
that kinda religion, but he was tryin’ t’put this down. And he said, 
Who art thou, Lord? 
“And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutist. It is^ hard for 
thee to kick against the priest. This is so sharp, if you kick again’ 
it, it’ll take you down. 
“Now here in the twentieth chapter [Acts 20:28] says, Take heed 
therefore unto yourselves and all the flock over which the Holy 
Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God. Now th’people 
won’t let it go by th’name of th’Church of God. They’ll change it 
to whatever they want t’call it, don’t they? But there’s just one church, 
Which he hath purchased with his own blood. See. He suffered 
for this church. For I know this, [Acts 20:29] I was preachin’ on 
this last night, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter 
in among you, not sparing the flock. 
“Now He’s a’callin’ everybody a wolf that starts preachin’ different. 
Also of your own selves [Acts 20:30] shall men arise, speaking per¬ 
verse things to draw away disciples after them. 
“Then He wrote a letter over here. [Galatians 1:6-8] ‘I marvel

that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the 
grace of Christ unto another gospel.’ Said he’s a’preachin’ th’right 
one and I start preachin’ another’n and some a’his members is 
a’listenin’ at me and they’re cornin’ out from hearin’ him. ‘Which 
is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert 
the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach 
any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto 
you, let him be accursed.’ 
“Now he’s gonna’ say it again: ‘As we said before, so say I now 
again. If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye 
have received, let him be accursed.’ Now if you preach, you better 
preach this. If there’s a curse on ever’body that don’t preach this, 
we better preach this. He picked these men and sent them to the 
people. 
“Now we can read another verse right here. Said, ‘Now, I beseech 
you, brethren. [Romans 16:17-18] Mark them which cause divisions 
and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and 
avoid them.’ And listen what he says now: ‘For they that are such 
serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good 
words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.’ 
“And mark’em. He said, so you can see who they are and you 
won’t get in with’em. It’s awful close, this is! Yes, it’s close. That’s 
close. They say th’government’s strict, but now this, this is strict. 
“Some people never pay much attention t’this chapter here [Luke 
16:22-31]. ‘And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried 
by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and 
was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and 
seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried 
and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, 
that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; 
for I am tormented in this flame.’ Abraham’s gonna talk back to 
him. ‘But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime 
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but 
now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And beside all this, 
between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which 
would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, 
that would come from thence. Then he said, I pray thee therefore, 
father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house: for I have 
five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come 
into this place of torment.’ Gon’ talk back to him. ‘Abraham saith 
unto him. They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will 
they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.’ Now God just 
had Moses and th’prophets there. He’s not gonna change it t’suit 
that man. Now He sent His Son here and made Him suffer and 
die and He’s not gonna change it for me and you. God’s too big 
t’do that. He won’t change it for nobody. Now if we don’t teach 
this, we’ll come t’th’judgment and we’ll sure go down. 
“And it says, ‘Withdraw yourself from every brother that walkest 
disorderly.’ They’s so many people that don’t believe this, and I 
try t’prove this by chapter and verse to’em, and you can’t do a 
thing with some. They’ll preach right on just like they been preachin’ 
and you tell’em. Now let me read a verse’r’two here. [Matthew 18:15- 
17] ‘Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and 
tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, 
thou has gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take 
with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three wit¬ 
nesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to 
hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the 
church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.’ 
Now that’ll put th’thing on y’! God’s got a purpose for everything 
in here—and it cost Him th’best He had [to establish His church]. 
Let’s read one more, and then this boy [one of the Foxfire editors] 
will make a preacher. [Matthew 16:13-19] ‘When Jesus came into 
the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom 
do men say that I the Son of man am? And they said, Some say 
that thou art John the Baptist: some Elias; and others, Jeremias, 
or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that 
I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, 
the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not re¬ 
vealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say 
also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build 
my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I 
will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatso¬ 
ever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatso¬ 
ever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.’ Now what 
if he goes out preachin’ one church and me another and you’ll 
say, ‘Well, which one did He build? The one he’s a’preachin’ or 
the one I’m preachin’?’ He just built one church. Now say we’ve 
three or four preachers here, and one of us gets offended and he

don’t want a fellowship with us no more and he goes out and starts 
him up a thing he calls a church and he’s gonna name it somethin’r’- 
nother, well, that’ll divide somebody up, and that’s th’way they get 
started. These men was of one accord when they got started. This 
is where it started. The church He built, that’s where all these 
churches started from. 
“Now that’s th’only thing I love about this [article]. It’s not to 
show me up that I’m somethin’r’nother, but t’show that this is God’s 
way. I wouldn’t want a bit of a slur, ’ner nothin’. I want this sincere.”

Sunday. It is 9:30 in the morning. People begin arriving early 
for an annual homecoming service that promises to be a big one 
with family members coming in from as far away as Ohio and Indiana 
and Florida. In no time at all, the church is packed. 
The center of interest before the service is Dexter Callahan who 
arrives bearing two flat boxes. On the end of one, in white paint, 
are the words, “In Jesus’ Name.” Inside the boxes are live rattle-

snakes and copperheads. As he reaches the building, people crowd 
around and the rattlers inside buzz furiously. Then he pushes 
through the crowd, carries the boxes up to the front of the church, 
and slides them under a low bench behind the pulpit. 
The service starts with hymns. “Pull Off Your Shoes, Moses,” 
“On the Resurrection Morning,” “Running Up the King’s Highway,” 
and “Amazing Grace” are old favorites. From there on, however, 
it happens as the spirit dictates: a series of different preachers stand 
and talk whenever the spirit moves them to do so; people in the 
congregation do likewise, either testifying or asking the prayers of 
the group for themselves or an ailing relative; and periodically 
through the meeting, the music starts, serpents are brought out, 
and there are periods of intense activity.

Music is provided by guitars—some of them electric. There are 
no hymn books; the congregation knows the hymns by heart. Chil¬ 
dren with tambourines provide rhythm and a staccato punctuation 
to the verses. 
“Praise th’Lord! He that believeth and be baptized SHALL be 
saved! Praise th’Lord! He that believeth and be baptized SHALL 
be saved! A man has got to believe th’Word of God! Praise th’Lord! 
If he hears th’Word of God and don’t do it, it won’t be no good. 
If people go down t’th’river and are baptized an’ don’t believe God’s 
Word, you’re baptized in vain! Hallelujah! Praise God! It’s not 
th’hearer that’s justified but th’doer! Hallelujah! And He says, ‘And 
these signs shall follow them that believe.’ I’m glad God put that 
in m’heart! I’m GLAD He put that in m’heart! ‘An’ these signs shall 
follow them that believe,’ He said, ‘in my name.’ There’s th’name 
a’Jesus again. You can’t get around th’name a’Jesus. Hallelujah! 
‘In my name shall they cast out devils.’ Hallelujah to God, they 
SHALL speak with new tongues! Praise th’Lord! They SHALL take 
up serpents. Hallelujah t’God, they SHALL take up serpents! And 
if they drink of any deadly thing, it SHALL not hurt them! They 
SHALL handle th’sick an’ they SHALL recover. Hallelujah t’God! 
Why is it we pray for the sick an’ they don’t recover? Because we 
don’t believe God’s Word! We don’t believe it! If we did, they’d 
be healed! Hallelujah t’God! An’ He said, ‘These signs shall follow 
them that believe in my name.’ Hallelujah t’God! He said, ‘They 
SHALL handle th’sick and they SHALL recover.’ If they’s one of 
us sick, an’ I lay my hand on her in th’name a’Jesus, she’d be made 
whole! Because God’s Word said that it would be, I believe that 
it’s so! Praise the Lord! As th’Bible says—I believe James said—‘If 
there’s any buried, let’em sing songs!’ Hallelujah t’God, if there’s 
any afflicted, let him pray. If there’s any sick among ye, hallelujah 
t’God, let them pray over him in th’name of th’Lord! There’s that 
name again [much clapping]. You can’t get around it, boys. You 
can’t get around th’name a’Him. Anoint’em in oil in th’name of 
th’Lord. God is real! I’m glad tonight He’s in my life. I’m glad 
He’s in my soul. 
“I love Him tonight. Hadn’t a’been fer Him, me and you’d a’still 
been lost tonight. Praise God, praise God! I’d love t’say this. Scrip¬ 
ture says, and He said in that fourth verse, ‘I have manifested thy 
name.’ Not my name, but thy name. ‘I have manifested thy name 
to th’men to which thou gavest me out of th’world. An’ thou gavest 
them to me. An’ they have kept th’Word.’ Didn’t He say that? They 
kept th’Word! ‘For I have given unto them Thy words which Thou 
gavest unto me, an’ they have received them.’ Didn’t they say that?

He said, ‘I pray for them. I pray not for the world but for those 
which Thou hast given me, for they’re Thine, and all mine are thine, 
and I am glorified in this. Didn’t he say that?’’ [The congregation 
answers, “Yes, He said that!”] 
“But these are in th’world, keep to thy own name holy, those 
that thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. If me 
an’ you aren’t one tonight in Jesus Christ, someone’s a hypocrite

kept them in Thy name, those thou gavest me I have helped, and 
none of them is lost, but that th’scripture might be fulfilled.’ Amen. 
Praise God! ‘These things I speak in th’world, that they might have 
my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given unto them th’Word Thou 
hast given as I’m not of th’world. I pray not that Thou shouldest 
take them out of the world, but Thou should keepest them from 
th’evil.’ Amen! You know what that next verse said? ‘Sanctify him 
through Thy truth!’ Seventeenth verse of John 17. ‘Sanctify him 
through Thy truth.’ What did He say was truth? The Word is truth! 
Hallelujah! Didn’t he say that [shouting]? The Word is truth! Save 
your time, pull out th’truth. The Word is truth! 
“ ‘Thou hast sent me into th’world, even so I am also a’sendin’ 
them into th’world, an’for their sake, I sanctify myself that they 
might also be sanctified through th’truth.’ Listen t’what this next 
verse says, ‘Neither pray I for these alone, but for all-l-l that believe 
on me through their works.’ Is that what He said? Somebody said 
we won’t have an apostle doctrine. But if we don’t, we won’t have 
th’Word of God. Amen! 
“I believe in God’s signs! I believe in th’Word of God. I believe 
in God. I believe in takin’ up serpents with all my heart. I believe 
in drinkin’ strychnine’n’deadly poison. I believe in whatever God 
puts on me t’do, that’s what I wanta do! I believe in God. If we’re 
led by th’Spirit of God, hallelujah to God, and feel with th’Spirit 
a’God that it won’t be no harm come t’us. 
“Praise God! His great big eye’s watchin’ ever’ one of us. Hallelu¬

[Softer and almost tearfully.] I’m glad th’Lord’s savin’ souls tonight. 
Hallelujah to God if you’ve ever seen a man sincere t’God’s Word. 
I believe in God’s Word with all my heart. Hallelujah t’God! I said,

ZACCHAEUS TOO HIGH IN A SYCAMORE TREE 
Lord Jesus came a walkin’ along one day 
With a crowd all gathered around. 
He cast his eyes in a sycamore tree, 
And what d’you think He found? 
He found a man a lookin’ for him 
Way up in a sycamore tree. 
He said, “Zacchaeus, you come down, 
Today I must abide with thee.” 
Chorus: 
Well, all you people with your little proud hearts, 
This is what you are to me. 
You’re just another Zacchaeus 
When th’Lord come to bless you, 
Too high in the sycamore tree. 
Too high in the sycamore tree. 
Well, some of our sisters, they go to church 
With their hair cut off and gone. 
Their little eyebrows that God gave them, 
Just won’t leave them alone. 
With a little paint here and a little paint there, 
Just can’t hardly tell; 
Instead a wantin’ to look like Jesus Christ, 
They look like a Jezebel. (Chorus) 
Well, some of our sisters, they love this world; 
They won’t give it up at all. 
When they go out to buy their clothes, 
They get’em wa-a-y too small. 
Well, what is th’Lord gonna do, 
What is He gonna say? 
When He finds that th’sisters wear their clothes so tight, 
That they can’t kneel down to pray. (Chorus)

Well, some of our brothers, they go to church 
With a stiff collar and a little bow tie. 
They like a pat upon the back, 
And they set in their seats so high. 
Their eyes is on their brother’s lap; 
Their heart’s so full of doubt. 
If th’Lord was to come to bless their soul, 
They’d be too proud to shout. (Chorus) 
Well, brother, you can watch my life, 
Ain’t got a thing to hide. 
Since God came down and saved my soul, 
Had to give up my pride. 
Now, if you’re walkin’ this narrow road 
Leadin’ to th’gates of pearl; 
When you meet your neighbors out on the street, 
Then you won’t look like th’world. (Chorus) 
AMEN, AMEN, THERE’S A HIGHER POWER 
Well, some come crippled and some come sick; 
There’s a higher power. 
Till the healin’s done, we ought not quit;

Amen, amen, there’s a higher power; 
Amen, amen, there’s a higher power. 
Well, when you get over in the book of Acts,

There’s a higher power. 
You’d better let signs follow you around; 
There’s a higher power. (Chorus)

Following, as recorded during the service, are pieces of sermons 
and testimony extracted from the whole in an attempt to give some 
feeling for the spirit evident in these two aspects of a long and 
complicated service. 
“I’m s’hoarse I can’t hardly talk. How thankful I am that that 
Savior died for me. Brother! He’s been good t’me! I’ve been in 
th’hospital an’ th’doctor gave me up t’die. They sent me home— 
there was no hope. But th’Lord wasn’t finished with me. No, He 
wasn’t finished with me. He spared my life. I wanta’ serve Him 
more than anything else in th’world. Y’know, th’Lord moved on 
me t’go up there an’take up that fire. Y’know, I used t’get up an’ 
just hold it in my hands, an’ I felt it not. Praise be t’God!” 
“As I watched those brothers with th’serpents, it come t’me an’ 
I thought, ‘Lord, those things are deadly!’ This song was on my 
mind and I said, ‘Lord, these things are just as deadly t’us, the 
things of th’flesh are just as deadly to us as these serpents are to 
our flesh. It’s death t’us th’same way if we let th’fruits of th’flesh

ruin our lives. We’re not of God, we’re dead! We’re dead as sin.’ 
I thought, ‘Lord, that same spirit that’s able to conquer that serpent, 
yeah, that same spirit can save us from ruining our lives.’ Glory 
t’God!” 
“You know, this seems more like old-time salvation than anything 
I’ve seen or heared of. But still, I got t’work out m’own salvation. 
I’ve got t’testify what th’Lord’s done f’me, an’ He has done a’plenty 
for me. He’s been so good t’me an’ merciful t’me. I just pray tonight 
for th’plan a’salvation that He has left here f’us. Tonight is th’way 
built from earth t’heaven. I declare He wrote that f’us t’go by. 
Y’know, when y’start out on a long trip, I’ve noticed, my children, 
that y’have t’have a map t’go by. Y’know, children, they don’t go 
by th’map, they don’t know where they a’going! Y’know, tonight, 
that Bible’s just like that. Hallelujah! Praise His Name! Oh, hallelu¬ 
jah, that it came t’me each day! 
“We know, Brother Browning, we’ve heard enough good preachin’ 
here tonight, t’save th’whole world. If they’d just bow down and 
accept th’Lord. Just let Him into our heart an’ serve Him in the 
beauty of holiness. Anything shorter than th’Word of God, you’re 
not a’gonna’ make it. I’m gonna’ climb higher an’ higher an’ higher. 
Tonight, children, we’re gonna’ have t’look up, for th’perfect gift 
comes from above. Hallelujah! We need some of them good gifts 
tonight, don’t we?

“You know, I see them signs upon our believers tonight. Oh, 
children, where else can He go t’see them signs? The full gospel 
preached, praise th’Lord! You know, people won’t talk about th’signs 
that follow’em, children. I mean the serpents that’s a dangerous 
sign. They don’t care a bit t’go over there an’ pray fer th’sick now 
because they know I’ll tell them that sick person ain’t a’gonna hurt- 
’em. But, boy, let a Baptist get a’hold of a big ol’ snake an’ they’ll 
shore back off. I believe that with all m’heart. You know, tonight I 
wanta hold t’th’good Word of God. I don’t believe we’ve got much 
longer to’hold HIM up—I believe He’s a’comin’ back. Everyone 
of ye pray for me.” 
“I’ll tell ye what. Before I ever come up here, I always talk t’th’Lord 
about it. Then I ain’t afraid t’come, if everything’s all right, it’s all 
right. ’At’s a rule to go by. I don’t pay no ’tendon t’what my sister 
said, but I have to obey th’Lord. I’ve GOT to do what th’Lord says. 
I’m s’glad tonight that I’m livin’ an’ know Jesus. I’m glad tonight 
of th’name a’Jesus. 
“I got t’thinkin’ this, that th’Lord has been s’good t’us! But you 
know what? I’m more than glad, can’t hardly wait f’th’time t’get 
started up. I’m not afraid when th’Lord tells me so. 
“I done got paid tonight f’this trip a’ready. If I don’t get t’stay 
f’tomorrow’s service, I done got paid tonight. I believe in th’Holy 
Ghost tonight, an’ I believe tonight that I really got it! An’ second 
business, I know I got it! It won’t let me go around a’talkin’ ’bout 
my brothers an’ sisters. An’ it won’t let me go down t’th’church 
an’ just set an’ look an’ see what I can see an’ see if I can see 
somethin’ t’talk about. I’ll tell ye tonight, I LOVE th’Lord! 
“I believe in serpent handlin’ a hun’erd percent. My wife never 
did believe in it. She always told me wasn’t nothin’ to it. Said it’uz 
th’devil’s work. An’ I got bit over here. ’At’s been a long time ago. 
I’ve been a’handlin’ ’em ever since. I ain’t never quit. I won’t NEVER 
quit! Until th’Lord tells me. Pray fer me.” 
The sermon stops, guitar chords blending in behind the final 
shouts and exhortations and hallelujahs. And suddenly the tiny frame 
building is filled with music. It is so loud it jams every crack, fills 
every crevice; and the congregation is on its feet, singing, clapping, 
swaying, filled with a joy and an urgency and an intensity that brings 
even those in the back crowding to the front. It is deafening. But 
it is not chaotic clamor. The hymn is still there, clear and strong 
and true, soaring above the noise and the shouts. 

============================================================
PAGE 396
============================================================

PLATE 163 
Over the music and the rhythmic clapping of a hundred pairs of 
hands, people begin to speak in tongues, to jerk involuntarily, to 
raise their arms high and cry out the name of Jesus. And if the 
spirit is true—if all the necessary conditions blend perfectly—sud¬ 
denly a long flat box slides out from under a pew and serpents 
are everywhere. 
. . they shall take up serpents . . 
The following sections picture members of the congregation in 
the act of receiving four of the gifts previously outlined (handling 
serpents, holding fire, talking in tongues, and healing). We have 
divided the gifts into sections for convenience as there are Bible 
verses, pieces of interviews and so on that belong especially to each 
gift. In an actual service, however, all of these things take place 
simultaneously. The drinking of deadly poisons is not illustrated 
here as that was not done in the services we attended. It had been 
done in the past, however—once, we were told, even being verified

PLATE 165 As the music thunders, Dexter, who says, “I think th’most [ser¬ 
pents] I’ve held at one time is nine,” pulls them from their boxes and passes 
them out to reaching hands. And as the intensity swells, some members of 
the congregation become so involved they find themselves dancing and waving 
their arms, despite the fact that poisonous serpents dangle from their hands. 
PLATE 166 “If you believe 
that it ain’t gonna bite you, then 
you got power. That gives you 
faith. And then th’Holy Ghost 
just has t’be there. You must 
have that. [When I hold a ser¬ 
pent] I just get down and hold 
it right out there. Sometimes I 
pray, but if I get afraid, or lose 
my faith, I get shed of it as quick 
as I can. If y’don’t, it’s danger¬ 
ous. Say you got one and you 
lose faith, you better get shed of 
it or it’ll bite you. 
“Now they was a drunk man 
down here at a little church and 
he said, ‘That thing won’t bite.’ 
And th’old man that had it said, 
‘That’ll bite’cha directly.’ And he 
raised th’lid hisself and he said, 
‘Now, that’ll bite’cha.’ 
“And th’man said. ‘It won’t 
bite. It’s got its teeth pulled.’ 
And he had a handkerchief goin’ 
around over it and it struck him 
on th’finger there. And he just 
dropped ever’thing and split that 
with a knife and began t’suck 
that. But he had t’go t’th’doctor 
with it. That’ll rot your finger off. 
If th’Lord don’t kill it, you 
better.”

“And I said, ‘Let him come

when he got to preachin’, he 
went and got three rattlesnakes 
that they brought out of that box, 
and he handled them a little bit 
and laid them up on th’Bible 
stand. And his brother was sittin’ 
over right in th’corner and he 
was a’lookin’ right this way like 
he was taking every word of it 
in. 
“And he took these three over 
there and laid them right down

to crawl. And one of them 
crawled up and bit him. 
“This man was a’speakin’ at

‘It ain’t a’gonna hurt him.’ 
“My wife said—I don’t know 
whether she said it out loud or 
not—said, ‘It’s a’gonna’ kill that 
man.’ 
“Well, he got sick in a little 
bit and they took him out. And 
they prayed about an hour out 
in th’car lot. And somebody took 
him to Tennessee and his folks, 
after they’d see’d him, they took 
him to th’hospital. But by that 
time it was too late. He died in 
twenty-six hours.” 
PLATE 168 “One of th’mem- 
bers died in ’40. That was a day, 
now, that I told ’em not t’bring- 
’em in. I told’em not t’bring’em 
in because these brothers in 
th’church had a little disagree¬ 
ment and weren’t a’feelin’ good 
towards each other. And I said, 
‘Don’t bring’em in. Don’t need 
it today.’ And this man just 
brought one in over me and he 
took it in and took it out and this 
other boy got it and had it and 
just lookin’ back over th’crowd

doctor him. That’s th’only one 
we ever had.”

that. If somebody catches me in 
th’spirit handlin’ serpents, that’s 
all right. But I don’t get out here

Of all the above ways of having “victory,” perhaps the most visually 
dramatic is the holding of rattlesnakes and copperheads. The congre¬ 
gation member most actively involved with serpents is Dexter Calla¬ 
han. He has been involved with them since that day he was saved 
and came to Christ ten years ago. Believing that God blessed him 
and gave him that job, he is the man who keeps most of the snakes 
used in the services. He believes it is his calling. A newspaper clipping 
he carries in his wallet tells of his recent arrest and fine by a local 
sheriff for carrying serpents to a public gathering—a custom out¬ 
lawed by the state. And a recent piece written about him by a couple 
of journalists infuriated him because it hinted that he was simply 
unusually proficient at handling snakes, and gave not a word to 
his complete conviction that his ability to handle them is not a per¬ 
sonal skill, but is totally a gift of the Holy Ghost.

Dexter is far from casual about his attitude toward serpents as 
his wife’s brother-in-law was bitten and died, and he himself has 
been bitten twelve times—three of those in one night. He admits 
that he was “laid up” as a result of two of those bites, but claims 
that he wasn’t affected at all by the other ten. Several times he 
was “in the spirit” when he first took them up, but the spirit left 
him while he was holding them. At other times, there were bad 
feelings in the room that ruined the effect of the blessing, and caused 
the serpents to strike. He remembers that when he was bitten by 
a copperhead, it felt like he had put his whole hand in fire. 
So he approaches them with a respect bred of experience. He 
can sometimes pick them up in the woods, but only when he has 
his mind on the Lord. If he has what he calls a “carnal mind” (his 
thoughts on worldly things rather than God), he leaves them alone. 
But, during the service, when the spirit is upon him, he is a center 
of activity.

PLATE 172 “Everybody’s got a certain amount of faith. If your intentions 
are goin’ back home, you’ve got faith that you’re goin’ t’make it. 
“Take my little boy. When he was about three years old, he didn’t really 
understand what he was doin’. He said, ‘Daddy, I want t’handle a big one [ser¬ 
pent].’ I gave him a big one. I just gave him a big one. And he held his hand 
out and took it and I started telling him, I said, ‘Son, if you do this, you gotta 
live with it.’ ”

PLATE 173 “I’ve seen people 
put snakes around their necks— 
in their bosoms. There was a 
woman once that had pretty long 
hair and a copperhead crawled 
right up in her hair. Th’copper- 
heads ain’t as dangerous as 
th’rattlers. Copperheads will bite 
you quicker, but th’rattle 
snakes’ll kill you. They bust a 
man’s heart. I heard a man say 
th’doctor said one man’s heart 
was busted. He was killed.” 
PLATE 174 “I tell’em not 
t’keep th’snakes through th’win- 
terdme, but they do sometimes. 
It’s out a’season. It’s a cold air 
thing that needs to be in 
th’ground when it comes their 
time. Then when it comes warm, 
they come out theirself. Dexter’s 
got about eighty serpents, I 
think. He’s got them at his house. 
Now I teach that two of them is 
enough, but they’ve had three 
boxes of them. Sometimes we 
can get our minds more on this 
than getting someone saved. The 
soul of th’man is worth more 
than this. Maybe you think you 
can do something that nobody 
else can do and then you get 
shook up and don’t want to do 
that. Now that’s a dangerous 
spot t’be in.”

never felt it n’more. Just a little sting. I might not a’been anointed. I just 
went t’stick m’hand out t’take it and it bit me right in th’palm of my hand. 
It never did bite me before and it never did bite me since.” The speaker’s 
wife believes that the bite might have been designed to be a sign to the 
congregation that even though he got bitten, he didn’t get sick because he 
had the proper faith in God. “When I hold serpents, there’s no feelin’s. 
Nothin’ but that there ain’t no fear about you.”

burn up whole woods. It will

gets to. 
“Now I’ve seen this little bottle 
of propane gas been handled and 
that’s hot. And there was another 
man one time that said he could 
handle that fire and he got his 
hands burnt to two big crispers.”

“See, they was goin’ t’put these three Hebrew boys in th’fiery 
furnace if they didn’t bow and worship what th’King had set up 
fer’em t’worship. And they refused. And th’strongest men they had 
bound these boys. And as they dropped’em in, it consumed these 
strong men, but it didn’t hurt them three nary a bit. They got in 
there loose and walked about. Saw four then. That fourth one was 
like unto th’Son of God. 
“We started with fire before we had serpents. Before we had any 
electricity, we had these little kerosene lamps that has a glass chimney 
that sits down on them. You know what I’m talking about? And 
they was hot, and we had them in th’church. It was the only kind 
of light we had. And [my wife] would shout up and dance up to 
that globe and take that off, and if it wasn’t for the good Lord, it 
would blister you as soon as it touched you. It gets hot enough to 
blister you. My hands would be tougher than a woman’s hands, 
but it would blister my hands. If I picked it up and lifted it off, it 
would leave a blister on each hand. But she would, and just shout 
right around and just feel fine. 
“And she’d raise her hair up that way and run it through a carbide 
light [and it wouldn’t singe]. You ever seen a carbide light? Them 
that’s got a red streak that sticks out farther than that? My nephew 
said, ‘That old fire won’t burn.’ He got that carbide light and stuck

prayed for him, they said he 
come up a’jumpin’, and he took 
one of them carbide lights right 
by th’face. And th’blaze should 
have burnt his hands off. But one 
of them fellows checked his 
hands for burns. No burns there. 
“When I hold fire, it feels cool 
just like there’s no fire there. 
One time I thought in myself I 
had a little faith and I wanted to 
handle it in such a way that peo¬ 
ple couldn’t doubt that fire. You 
know, y’see people that kindly 
waver. I wanted them t’know 
there was no doubt about it. 
Well, I had a little faith and I 
pulled my shoe off and stuck [the 
flame] to my sock and left it there 
plenty long enough t’cut my sock 
apart. And about that time it

that tough part of his hand. He said, ‘It will burn, won’t it?’ ” 
Several containers rested on the pulpit. Two of them were filled 
with kerosene and had large wicks in their necks. One was a Pepsi 
bottle, the other, a metal canister. Despite the activity swirling all 
around us, it was hard not to notice when one of these was lit, for 
the flames often rose a foot or more into the air. 
We saw men at a pitch of intensity strip off their shoes and socks 
and hold the flames for minutes at a time under their bare feet. A 
woman thrust the fire right into her hair and held it there, and 
not a hair was singed. 
. . they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall 
recover.” 
Throughout the church, oblivious for the moment to the serpents 
and fire around them, are tiny clusters of people, their attention 
riveted on a man or woman or child in the center. Usually that 
person is ill and has asked (or his parents have asked) that he be 
prayed for. Hands reach out, sometimes touching the afflicted part 
and sometimes not, and those outside the little circle often touch 
those who are touching the afflicted as if to make a human chain 
of energy.

"In my name shall they cast out devils, they shall 
speak with new tongues . . 
The peak of intensity. The pinnacle of the service during which 
time those who are the luckiest, the most faithful, the most deserving 
receive the ultimate gift on earth: the gift of the Holy Ghost. Every¬ 
thing leads up to this. Holding serpents and handling fire are but 
the preliminaries. This is the climax. It is visible proof that you 
have received the Spirit of God; for when you have the true Spirit, 
you receive the Holy Ghost, and when you receive the Holy Ghost, 
you speak in tongues. And until you speak in tongues (which is 
the Spirit talking through you), you haven’t carried your faith far 
enough; you haven’t believed strongly enough. Only a few will make 
it which is, Browning and his followers believe, as it must be for 
“Jesus said only a few would find Him.” Thus the intensity of the 
requests. “You’ve got to ask for the Holy Ghost to come!” 
People crowd to the altar. They are anointed with olive oil, prayed 
over, demons are driven out, and those cleansed sometimes fall to 
their knees in an effort to reach the peak. 
And when the Holy Ghost has come and gone, the fortunate are 
left with a gift to use to prove their faith: that of speaking in tongues, 
of being able to prophesy, of discerning spirits, or of knowledge. 
And when the day Pentecost was fully come, they were all with 
one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound 
from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the 
house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them 
cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. 
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to 
speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 
And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out 
of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, 
the multitude came together, and were confounded, because 
that every man heard them speak in his own language. 
—Acts 2:1-6 
And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will 
pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your 
daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, 
and your old men shall dream dreams; And on my servants 
and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my 
Spirit; and they shall prophesy.

Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one

and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

“Now that gift of the Holy Ghost, when you get that gift, you 
can get a spiritual gift. So you come to this church here, and you 
get a spiritual gift. You may get the gift of prophecy, or the gift 
of praying. Or you may get the gift of discerning spirits, or the 
gift of knowledge. If you get the gift of knowledge through that 
spirit, then you’ll have the knowledge of this Bible and you can 
teach everyone of this knowledge.” 
“You’ve got to ask for th’Holy Ghost to come. [If it doesn’t come] 
you just ask for it more. Just keep asking. When it comes, it just 
moves on you. It just operates. It’s a feeling in th’flesh. You feel 
good and you feel clear and you feel there’s not any sin about you. 
It’ll come on you at times. We sit here, and you see th’wind blow 
and we hear th’sound and we hear th’roar of the wind, but we can’t 
tell when it’s coming and we can’t tell where it’s going. It goes 
on. ‘So is everyone bom of th’Spirit’, said th’Spirit. There’s a sound 
goes with it. Say you get th’Holy Ghost and you speak in tongues, 
I can hear th’sound but I can’t tell what you’re sayin’. Let you be 
a sound. Well, your tongue is gonna’ speak when He comes—the 
Holy Ghost. ‘When He comes, He shall testify of me.’ We read 
that here in John 15:26.” 
“First time I got th’Holy Ghost, I spoke in tongues, and then I 
didn’t speak in it no more for a long time. I lost a day’s work. I 
was boss of th’railroad up here. Th’man was holdin’ a Bible. And 
I prayed and asked for [a blessing] over and over and over. And 
other people were gettin’ th’Holy Ghost—that was on a revival— 
and I felt like I wanted it the worst I ever did in my life. And I

“I guess it lasted fifteen minutes—or maybe not that long. Then 
I came to myself and I could talk back. That’s a mystery, ain’t it? 
That’s a mystery.” 
Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that 
ye may prophesy. For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue 
speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understand- 
eth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. But he 
that prophesieth edifieth the church. I would that ye all spake 
with jtongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he 
that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except 
he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. 
—I Corinthians 14:1-3 
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray 
that he may interpret. For if I pray in an unknown tongue, 
my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 
—I Corinthians 14:13-14 
I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: yet in 
the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, 
that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand 
words in an unknown tongue. 
—I Corinthians 14:18-19 
How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one 
of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a 
revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto 
edifying. If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by 
two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one 
interpret. But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence 
in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
—I Corinthians 14:26-28 
Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak 
with tongues. Let all things be done decently and in order. 
—I Corinthians 14:39-40 
Browning says that when his followers are challenged, it is often 
on the basis of the above passages of scripture. But he points out 
that it is only better to prophesy if there is no interpreter available; 
and it does say, “. . . forbid not to speak with tongues. . . .” 
“When you speak in tongues, it just takes, and you don’t know.

Maybe you’re praying, and it just comes down and you quit speaking 
in unknown tongues. It’s a good feeling, a good feeling. 
“If you’re speaking in tongues and interpreting, we’re getting 
what you’re saying. See, you’ll stop speaking to God and you’ll go 
to speaking to us telling what the Holy Ghost is saying through 
you. Then it edifies us. But if you can’t interpret it, you’re still 
speaking to God. 
“If you can speak in tongues and then interpret, you’re just as 
great as Him speaking every word we can understand. You can speak 
in tongues and then tell us what it said, [but if you can’t interpret], 
it still edifies you. And you’re getting the knowledge of God about 
something or other that you can tell us later on when you get to 
speaking back naturally again.” 
“My wife has two gifts. She has the gifts of discerning and proph¬ 
ecy. Discerning means she can tell whether it’s a’workin’. She can 
be a’talkin’ to you and tell whether you believe it or not. You ain’t 
a’speakin’ it, but she can tell. If you’re thinkin’ somethin’ about

“It’s like in Acts 5:1-3. He knew he’d left some of it back. He 
[was discerning]. Like I say, ‘Me and her sold this and we’re bringin’ 
you all the money.’ But we put some back—laid some away. And 
we just say we sold it for [the amount] we brought you. If you 
have the gift of discerning, then you know all that. That’s th’way 
it works. Now it may not work all th’time, but it’s got to work when 
that Spirit is at work. When that Spirit works that way, you can 
tell if anyone’s lyin’ to you. 
“Now I’ll tell you one thing that she prophesied about. She proph¬ 
esied there was going to be a casket brought in the church house 
and it’s not going to be open. She didn’t know who the person 
was. But she gave that prophecy out and said there was going to 
be one. Well, this man I was telling you about got bit by that rattle¬ 
snake and died. And the undertakers came and got him and brought 
him over and said, ‘We can’t open it. That poison’s gone through 
his system.’ And they never did open that casket up. 
“Well, then later she prophesied again. She said, ‘There’s going 
to be another casket brought in and it’s not going to be opened.’ 
We still didn’t know who that was. And it was an eleven-year-old 
boy. There was a man over there holding a revival and in the meeting 
was a boy that had some feed for somebody that he was going to 
take after the meeting. He had one of these big long trucks with 
dual wheels, two wheels, you know, them big wheels. And the meet¬ 
ing broke and he got this truck and started up the road and this 
little boy jumped on the back of the truck—on the flat bed, you 
know. And he went up the road just a little and he must have jerked 
him off. Some thought there might be one that shoved the boy 
off, but we never did know. He went up and unloaded the feed 
and came back and saw the boy in the road and he blowed at him 
and he never moved. And he blowed again; he never moved. And 
he got out and his head was just smashed flat and they brought 
him to the undertakers and said, ‘You can’t open the casket.’ But 
she knowed about it. 
“There was another man. This man was a man that would maybe 
pray for a little while and then quit. Seemed like if you called him 
out and offered him a dram of whiskey and, well, he couldn’t resist 
that. Or he’d want to play pool or somethin’r’nother. She was sitting 
by her sister-in-law and she said, ‘I see somebody’s light go out 
tonight.’ She said that meant the Spirit.

PLATE 193 Then Philip went down 
to the city of Samaria, and preached 
Christ unto them. And the people with 
one accord gave heed unto those 
things which Philip spake, hearing and 
seeing the miracles which he did. For 
unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, 
came out of many that were possessed 
with them: and many taken with pal¬ 
sies, and that were lame, were healed. 
And there was great joy in that city. 
But there was a certain man, called Si¬ 
mon, which beforetime in the same city 
used sorcery, and bewitched the peo¬ 
ple of Samaria, giving out that himself 
was some great one: To whom they 
all gave heed, from the least to the 
greatest, saying, This man is the great 
power of God: And to him they had 
regard because that of long time he 
had bewitched them with sorceries. But 
when they believed Philip preaching 
the things concerning the kingdom of 
God, and the name of Jesus Christ, 
they were baptized, both men and 
women. Then Simon himself believed 
also: And when he was baptized, he 
continued with Philip, and wondered, 
beholding the miracles and signs which 
were done. Now when the apostles 
which were at Jerusalem heard that Sa¬ 
maria had received the Word of God, 
they sent unto them Peter and John: 
who, when they were come down, 
prayed for them, that they might re¬ 
ceive the Holy Ghost: (For as yet he 
was fallen upon none of them: only 
they were baptized in the name of the 
Lord Jesus.) Then laid they their hands 
on them, and they received the Holy 
Ghost.

PLATE 194 And he commanded us 
to preach unto the people, and to tes¬ 
tify that it is he which was ordained 
of God to be the Judge of the quick 
and dead. To him give all the prophets 
witness, that through his name whoso¬ 
ever believeth in him shall receive re¬ 
mission of sins. While Peter yet spake 
these words, the Holy Ghost fell on 
all them which heard the Word. And 
they of the circumcision which believed 
were astonished, as many as came with 
Peter, because that on the Gentiles also 
was poured out the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. For they heard them speak with 
tongues, and magnify God. Then an¬ 
swered Peter, can any man forbid wa¬ 
ter, that these should not be baptized 
which have received the Holy Ghost 
as well as we? And he commanded 
them to be baptized in the name of 
the Lord. Then prayed them him to 
tarry certain days.

later. I was having a prayer meeting just across the road. I was 
having a prayer meeting there on Thursday night and he come in. 
I believe he had a gun. You know what a pistol is, don’t you? I 
believe he had a gun on him. And he came in and I went to him 
and he was sitting in a chair, and I was trying to get him to come 
back and pray for the Lord. Finally, he said, ‘Kenneth, I won’t tonight 
but I will later,’ and that was on Thursday night. That Sunday him 
and his son-in-law got some whiskey and they got to drinking. They 
lived up in the holler above the church. They went on down, him 
and his son-in-law, about three miles down below the valley. They 
got in a fight and his son-in-law beat him up and throwed him out. 
He was by the side of the road and they brought him to the new 
hospital. I went to see him and they had him up and he never did 
speak. He just hollered. And they moved him to Louisville, and I 
believe he lived fifty-one days and died. She said that the man’s

videotape equipment, three cameras, and three tape recorders that 
we simply stretch out on the grass under trees and eat, hardly speak¬

few photographs of the picnic itself. And, later in the day, we go 
back to the building, pack our equipment, and drive across the moun¬

SUNDAY NIGHT 
Sunday night a handful of weary people turn up in the little church. 
The pace of the last few days shows in Browning’s face. And rather 
than a full sermon, he simply talks, quietly and with tremendous 
sincerity. At times his voice is almost inaudible. But the people feel 
his warmth—know he cares and they respond. In many ways, it is 
the most personal, most moving service of all. 
“In th’last days, th’Bible tells us, a prayerless time’ll come, when 
men will be lovers of their own selves, proud and blasphemous, 
disobedient of th’parents, truce-breakers, false security, without nat¬ 
ural affection. Oh, it’s terrible. It ain’t just one talkin’, it’s everybody 
you see right here, just talkin’ ’bout just how the time is changin’, 
how the time is changin’; it certainly is. 
“I’m thinkin’, while I’m settin’ there an’ singin’ that song, th’young 
people, if they don’t know nothin’ ’bout th’Lord, they ain’t got 
nothin’ t’build th’future on, have they? [Congregation: “Right. 
True.”] 
“Y’know there’s s’many people that don’t know what’s gonna hap¬ 
pen, an’ they don’t know of th’here-after, an’ they’re just a’goin’, 
and they don’t understand just what is gonna happen. They don’t 
understand where they goin’ to, if death was t’come along. Do they? 
[Congregation: “No-o-o.”] 
“Now I’uz thinkin’ about down at—, a man had a girl, an’ her 
boyfriend, they were started back to a college, an’ on their way, 
they got killed in a car wreck. Both of them got killed. Y’know, 
we might start out tonight in a car from here t’—. And th’ people, 
they don’t understand th’danger an’ you can hear s’many people 
gettin’ in wrecks. Y’just heard th’news that somebody’s going out 
[getting killed] every time y’hear it nearly. Like my daughter and I 
was coming from—an’ I don’t know if Brother Clifford or Brother 
David was with me a’drivin’, and I said, ‘Aren’t you afraid?’ She 
said, ‘No, I’m not afraid,’ I said, ‘Aren’t you afraid of this seventy 
mile an hour, something to happen to th’car, or a blow-out or some¬ 
thing?’ She said, ‘No, I ain’t afraid.’ Y’know, seems like it’s th’hardest 
thing t’git into th’people’s minds that they’s something out here 
that we got t’build up and while we’re alive, or we go down into a 
lake of fire. Go down into a lake of fire. Y’know, people ain’t taught 
that, they ain’t taught that an’ they seem like they don’t understand 
about it. Y’can’t hardly git nobody t’pay any attention now, can 
ye? [Congregation: “No.”]

“I remember what Brother Turner said. That man went down 
on to the city Samaria an’ changed that city down there. Yeah. The 
city of Samaria. An’ went an’ preached Christ to’em. An’ they gave 
heed t’that. Y’know, preachin’ would be a good job if people would 
just give heed. [Congregation: Yeah.] 
“Yeah, just give heed. Now y’know when my parents raised me, 
an’ I was up growin’, an’ I didn’t know—I just thought that’d be 
all they was to it [life]. I just thought that’d be all they was to it. 
I’uz never taught heaven or a new earth t’go to, or a people who’d 
never have n’more sorrow nor pain nor death, nor the part we’d 
go to if we died in our sins. I didn’t know about that. Just come 
in a little bit of killin’ a man a time or two, and just thought— 
well, I didn’t think about no penitentiary, I didn’t think about no 
man locking me up if I did bad, and maybe for years an’ years 
that I’d not be able t’get out. And I ain’t been taught about that. 
Y’know this Bible will teach us peace, peace with all men, and never 
harm nobody. To have our minds set on heavenly things. That they’s 
a spiritual kingdom that we got to get into while we’re here. It 
said they was first preached that they’d not get in because of un¬ 
believin’. Here we got t’believe just th’right way t’get in. We can’t 
just think if somebody’s been teachin’ us, we can’t believe if they’re 
not teachin’ us right, if they won’t let us in. We’ve got t’have this 
plan. I seen in th’paper the other day—had a boy’s picture—that 
he started preachin’ when he was four years old. I don’t know what 
kind of a preacher. But I do know when I hear somebody preachin’, 
I do know when they’re preachin’ these things that Jesus set down. 
I do know that. An’ if we’re not taught that kind of a doctrine, 
we’re not gonna make it. I don’t know why. I can’t understand why 
that they’s s’many different ways in a Bible, and they teach it one 
way, and the Bible teaches more than one faith, and how many 
different sects of religion they are in our world. One man told me 
they was twenty-three hundred different churches in the United 
States. And you heard me read today that Jesus sent out Peter—‘upon 
this rock I’ll build my church’—now, that’s the only one we ever 
know anything about. That’s the only one you can ever find out 
about in this Book. You can’t read about those other churches in 
this—the one He built is the only one you . can read about. But 
you can’t hardly get nobody to believe it. [Congregation: That’s 
right.] 
“Back when I was a boy, the first Bible I ever saw was in such 
fine print, and it had no concordance and no reference, and you 
just had to turn through it till you found something about it. Now 
they got it where you can just git a subject up, an’ seems like it’s

s’much easier. In my day, when I was a boy, they ain’t nobody who’d 
ever seen nobody hardly, readin’ [the Bible]. When I was gettin’ 
up about growed, I saw my uncle on Sunday sittin’ out under th’shade 
of a tree in a warm meader a’readin’ th’Bible. He was the only 
man. When we got married, we didn’t know nary a thing about 
th’law. We didn’t know nothin’. We’d heard somebody in the old 
time preachin’ that God so loved th’world that He gave His only 
begotten Son. Said, whoever believes in you shall not perish, but 
have Everlasting Life. Now then, tell us how we could get Eternal 
Life. You might read every bit of this till you find out what to do— 
it won’t help me none. I’ve got t’know how t’do this. [Congregation: 
That’s right.] 
“So it seems t’me that men and women today has gotta have 
somebody that knows about this God t’tell’em. God is tellin’ ya’what 
t’do. I just thought, ‘Well, I’m kinda tired, we’ve had meetin’ for 
a few nights standin’—five or six nights—and a lengthy meetin’ to¬ 
day’ and I thought, ‘Well, they’ll not be many out and I’m not much 
interested.’ But seems like I got here and I got so interested in 
this. And you know I’ve got interested in this tonight—far more 
than when the house was full. Sometimes we say, ‘Well, there won’t 
be many out, but there’s some soul out there that needs help.’ You 
know, if the Man hadn’t taken a lot of pains fer me, I never would 
have made it. I never would have got into this if He hadn’t taken 
a lot of pains to straighten me out. And tried and tried. You know, 
He told th’preacher, He said, ‘Preach th’Word.’ And He told him 
t’be incessant. Sometimes you get up here and you think there’s 
no ceasing with this. You’ve got to get up here and make an effort. 
But if He said, ‘Just sit down,’ you wouldn’t do nothin’. Getting

up—that’s what He’s talking about, ain’t it? To be incessant. Now 
it’s good when you’re incessant, and it’s a tribute to you. 
“You know I’m s’pleased with Bobby [directing his attention to 
a boy in the congregation] tonight, that I could read [that] Jesus 
went through death, and give His life, and suffered for th’church, 
that He called these men [apostles] and give’em His command t’go 
and teach’em. All nations, and that fits us into it, too. That it’s 
Russia; that it’s ever’ nation under heaven, to hear the apostles 
teach. Now different sects, there’s a difference in Bible teaching. 
That’s a little bit different, well, that’s what we’ll do. Some of’em’s 
teachin’ one way and some another—and they’re getting mixed up. 
“I know this Book—when I got started out in this, when I was a 
deacon in th’church, and they taught just like it is in the King James 
Version. But now this don’t suit ever’body. My brother-in-law 
dreamed a dream about me and said I had this here King James 
Version; I’m a’preachin’ an’ somebody come up behind me with a 
gun, and said, ‘Now, you can’t preach that. You can’t preach out 
of that King James Version no more.’ Try and stop me from it. 
“You know, we don’t know what we gettin’ into. We don’t know 
if th’world’s gonna stand for fifty years or twenty-five years, and it 
might be the shortest time. [Congregation: Yeah, it might.] 
“People don’t know. He said when they say peace and safety— 
then some destruction come upon mankind, and they shall not es¬ 
cape. You know, there’s nations might think they’re gettin’ together, 
and all this time they’re gettin’ prepared t’take men’s lives. And 
we just might be destroyed at any time. I don’t believe God will 
let any man, any nation, destroy the world. I believe He’ll do it 
Hisself when He gits ready. I believe He’s gonna bum it up. I believe 
He’s gonna burn it up with th’fire and brimstone that He’s got in 
store. He’s gonna do. Yeah. They may be a third part of th’ people 
killed or just an awful lot of them, but when God gets ready, He’s 
gonna destroy every man on earth. [Congregation: Yes, He is.] 
“I wish I’d known this when I was a boy, I’ll tell ya. I would of 
done a lot better. Don’t you think so? I shore do. I didn’t know 
what t’do. Instead of lookin’ on somebody don’t know a thing about 
this—we ought to be sorry for’em. They don’t know. Ain’t that right? 
Any of you read about that man that they called Solomon in the 
Old Testament? And think about th’things, the harmful things that 
he dpne, and he said he done it, too. Didn’t he? He didn’t know 
what to do. He didn’t know what to do. He thought he was doin’ 
th’will of God. Didn’t he? I just thought about that scripture, and 
111 read it now. Th last chapter of th’Old Bible. [He reads the scrip¬ 
ture.] We hear about earthquakes—said they’d be in diverse places_

several places. And you know we could be right here in th’church 
house and there’d come an earthquake and we’d never know what 
happened. They come in different places, and we just don’t know 
when this is cornin’. They’ve got s’much wisdom in th’world, and 
they’ve been makin’ s’many new inventions. The world of wisdom 
knew not God. Well, it’s cornin’ from some other source then. It’s 
coming from the wicked man. He’s invented all evil things. He’s 
th’inventor of that. And it’s just gettin’ worse and worse and worse. 
I told m’granddaughter that went down to college—I told her to 
take her a Bible along, and I told her I wanted her to read the 
Acts of the Apostles. I said that’s th’book that we need to know 
about. All these children ain’t never heard nobody preach out of 
Acts of the Apostles. I didn’t know they was any such a thing as 
th’gift of th’Holy Ghost. I didn’t know He said to repent. I didn’t 
know He said these things. The Bible says, ‘God hath revealeth 
unto us by His Spirit.’ By His Spirit. God said unto me—He’s not 
going to reveal unto me what I want to look for, but He’s revealing 
t’people an’ givin’ them th’revelation of things what He wants them 
t’know about. An’ He has t’do that by th’Spirit of God. That’s right. 
[Congregation: Amen.] 
“I think it would be good for us to pray. Y’know they’s s’many 
things, an’ y’know these people that they call th’Hoiiness people, 
when ever’thing fails, they want them to pray. I’m s’glad I started 
praying when I was not sick. Not down sick. And they’ll say, ‘Lord, 
I’m sick and I want you to heal me.’ I started out in this when I 
wasn’t sick. An’ I’ve never been sick in m’life. I’ve never lost a day’s 
work of being sick in my life. Praise th’name of Jesus. And I say 
it’s th’Lord that gives us strength. It’s th’Lord that keeps diseases 
off us. That’s right. I believe that. [Congregation: That’s right. I 
know it is.] 
“If this young man started out in this and held th’Lord, well, 
he’s got wonderful promises, ain’t he? ‘Honor the Creator,’ and 
He said, ‘Honor thy father and mother, and thy days shall be long 
upon the earth.’ Didn’t He? Hallelujah! 
[Whole congregation prays out loud, each his own prayer.] 
“If we live right, we won’t have a bit of trouble. Not a bit of 
trouble. If we live the way it’s on the paper here. What about that? 
And the Spirit’ll let us know. Here’s this sister right here that’s 
never been able t’go t’school t’read, but th’Spirit of God will let 
her know things. Hallelujah! Jesus never went to school. Nobody’s 
talked about Him. How does He know letters? His parents never 
sent Him to school—He had the wisdom of God. How does He 
know such wisdom as He’s got? Hallelujah! It come from the Wise

Man, the Man that gives us our wisdom. Praise the name of Jesus, 
praise His wonderful name. I wish I could get ever’one of you to¬

lujah, praise the name of Jesus. They ain’t but one way that we 
can know. We can’t see God, we can’t see th’Holy Ghost, we can’t 
see Jesus. They’re all up yonder, but the Holy Ghost is here, but 
He’s something that you can’t see here on earth. One man was all 
that was ever able to see that [Holy Ghost]. That’s John the Baptist. 
God said unto him, ‘You see the Holy Ghost.’ Glory to God! I 
can see you moving, but I can’t see in you. It’s something that 
gets inside. He’s in th’Father, he’s in Jesus. He’ll be in you. Jesus 
had Him in Him when He was baptized. He saw It come to Him 
in the bodily shape of a dove. Ain’t that so? If God made man in 
the image of the Holy Ghost, you couldn’t see man. He never made 
him in the image of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is 
different from God. God is a person. But you can’t see Him. I believe 
that’s the reason so many people don’t believe in Him. 
“The young people in school cornin’ up now is in a different 
shape. Lot of them don’t believe in God. They just don’t know 
just what kind of shape they are in. We ought t’be so sorry for 
these young people—we ought to do our greatest to try to help 
them. Ain’t that right? It certainly is right. 
“Praise the name of Jesus! On the Word of God we find out 
who God is. We certainly do. It’s good to have education. I’m not 
saying nothing about that. It’s good t’have the education to read 
this Bible. 
“Everything went so good today—everything went s’good. Yes, 
praise the name of Jesus! Bobby, pray, and when you feel like it, 
that you want to go to th’water and be brave in His name, don’t 
be a bit ashamed to say, ‘Preacher, I want to be baptized.’ They’s 
something promised for people who repent and are baptized. 
There’s something promised, Dorothy [directing his attention to a 
girl in the group], when we repent, when you get ready to be bap¬ 
tized, they’s something that the Lord has promised to you, that 
nobody can’t take from you. They can’t nobody take from you that, 
can they? [Congregation: No. Praise th’Lord!] 
“Still, there’s s’many people that want us t’pray for’em. They’s 
s’many people that’s in trouble. When you give in a request the 
Lord knows just what you need. He said just let your request be 
made known. I’m going to invite ever’body that will to get on their 
knees and pray for Bobby tonight. God bless this young man.” 
[Everybody prays out loud. Then they sing several songs together 
and the service ends.]

BAPTISTS 
T 
Ihe Baptists are perhaps 
the most diverse de¬ 
nomination in America. 
At last count there were at least fifty-three groups in the United 
States claiming the name Baptist in one form or another. The Bap¬ 
tists spread across Appalachia in such structured denominations as 
the Southern Baptist Convention, in loosely knit groups of Primitive 
Baptists, and in fiercely independent local congregations. Beyond 
the name, and a few common practices, the people called Baptists 
could not always agree on where they came from nor what they 
believed about the gospel and the church. 
Baptist Beliefs: 
Agreement and Disagreement 
There are, however, some common beliefs shared by most Baptist 
denominations. First, Baptists magnify the importance of the scrip¬ 
ture as the primary source of authority for the church. They are 
among those Christian bodies which advocate “no creed but the 
Bible” in matters of faith and doctrine. Historically, Baptists tend 
to avoid the use of creeds as binding upon the conscience of the 
individual. 
The concern for freedom of conscience, or “soul liberty,” has 
been a second characteristic of most Baptist groups. The individual 
is ultimately responsible for personal decisions regarding Christian 
faith and God alone is the ultimate judge of human conscience. 
This concern for soul competency was a major factor in the long¬ 
time Baptist support for freedom of religion and opposition to any 
state interference in matters of religion. 
Third, most Baptists place great emphasis on the autonomy of 
the local church in determining policies and procedures without 
the coersion of external ecclesiastical structure. Local autonomy, 
as much as any factor, has led to the proliferation of a variety of 

============================================================
PAGE 432
============================================================

430 
FOXFIRE 7 
Baptist denominations, individual churches, and doctrinal differ¬ 
ences, as well as a hesitancy to cooperate with other Christian groups. 
In most Baptist denominations, each congregation functions inde¬ 
pendently of any other. Baptists have defended this belief as strenu¬ 
ously as any which they possess. The stress on local autonomy has 
led most Baptists to be hesitant to speak of the “Baptist Church” 
but rather of “Baptist churches,” each one responsible for its own 
policies. 
Fourth, Baptists often define the church as a local congregation, 
composed of believers who have professed personal faith in Christ 
and have received baptism by immersion. The church, therefore, 
is to be made up only of those who testify to an evangelical, pietisdc 
experience of heart religion. Faith is highly personal and often comes 
to the individual through a dramatic, life-changing conversion expe¬ 
rience. 
Fifth, baptism is viewed as that symbolic expression of inward 
grace through which the believer identifies with Christ’s burial and 
resurrection. It is symbolic in the sense that it carries no inherent 
grace and points to an internalized experience of conversion. Bap¬ 
tism is to be administered only to believers by means of the immer¬ 
sion or dipping of the entire body in water. In this method, the 
new Christian reenacts Christ’s baptism and is received into member¬ 
ship of the local congregation. In the earliest Baptist churches of 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, baptism was usually ad¬ 
ministered to adults upon profession of faith in Christ. By the nine¬ 
teenth and twentieth centuries, however, many Baptist groups were 
baptizing children and adolescents in increasing numbers, some¬ 
times as early as five or six years of age.1 
Beyond these common characteristics, Baptists are divided over 
numerous matters of theology and practice. Questions regarding 
who may be saved, the process of salvation, the possibility of falling 
from grace, the role of the clergy, and the place of missions receive 
varied response from Baptist groups. Perhaps no greater differences 
have occurred among Baptists than in the theories regarding origins. 
Baptist Origins: 
Whence and Whither? 
The most familiar and popular explanation for Baptist beginnings, 
particularly prominent among the churches of Appalachia, is the 
view that Baptists can be traced along a “trail of blood” back to 
John “the Baptist” the New Testament Church. In this theory Bap¬ 
tists stand in a line of churches directly descended from the church 

============================================================

431 
of the New Testament era and are, therefore, older than Catholic 
or Protestant expressions of the church. 
This view was particularly important on the American frontier 
as Baptists sought to establish the credibility of their biblical inter¬ 
pretation and their origins. When debating Methodists or Presbyteri¬ 
ans, Baptists could point beyond Wesley or Calvin to a church 
founded at the time the New Testament was being written. In debat¬ 
ing Campbellites who claimed to have restored the New Testament 
church, Baptists could insist that their churches had always existed 
in some form throughout Christian history and therefore needed 
no restoration. 
This nineteenth-century movement was known as Landmarkism. 
Its advocates sought to distinguish the “landmark” principles which 
constituted the true church on earth. They cited Proverbs 22:28: 
“Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set.” 
In Landmarkism, the church was founded on Jesus Christ, who 
had conferred his authority, not on a succession of apostles, but 
on a succession of local congregations made up of duly baptized 
believers who professed personal faith in Christ. For the Landmarkist 
there were seven marks of the true church: 
1. The church composes the Kingdom of God. 
2. The church is a visible institution. 
3. The church’s locality is on earth (no universal church). 
4. The church is a local organization, a single congregation. 
5. Church membership is limited to those who have experienced 
personal faith and regeneration. 
6. Baptism is a symbol, administered only to believers (by im¬ 
mersion). 
7. The Lord’s Supper is an ordinance, a memorial given only 
to members of the local congregation. 
Throughout Christian history God had preserved churches of this 
nature and, thus, the true church had survived. Religious groups 
which did not conform to these New Testament doctrines were not 
churches but “societies,” lacking proper ordination, baptism, and 
biblical doctrines. 
Landmark concepts of the church indirectly influenced Baptist 
policies on baptism and church membership. Even today, many Bap¬ 
tist churches or denominations refuse to accept the baptism of those 
who have been baptized by other methods (sprinkling or pouring) 
or by other non-Baptist churches. Some require re-baptism of all 
who have not received immersion, while others require the re-immer-

sion of all who have not received baptism in a Baptist church. Land¬ 
mark views were also applied to the phrase “close communion,” 
which restricted the Lord’s Supper only to those who were members 
of the local congregation in which the Supper is observed. Land- 
markism is more prominent in the South and Southwest, having 
begun in the 1850s in Tennessee and Kentucky. The principles of 
a succession of “Baptist” churches existing from the New Testament 
times to the present, appears in various forms among Baptists in 
America and in Europe.2 
A second theory of origins is that modem Baptists were indirectly 
related to the radical Anabaptists of the sixteenth-century Protestant 
Reformation. These Swiss and German dissenters refused to baptize 
infants, favoring a baptism of believers, usually administered by 
pouring water on the convert’s head. The first Anabaptists appear 
in 1525 in Zurich, and are best represented today in the Mennonite 
and Hutterite communions. Their concern for a believer’s church, 
adult baptism, congregational church polity, and freedom of religion 
are compatible with Baptist views. However, their practice of passive 
resistance to war and their refusal to take oaths in civil matters 
distinguish them from early Baptists. Their influence is at best indi¬ 
rect, though many historians are divided over the matter of Anabap¬ 
tist impact on early Baptists.3 
A third theory proposes that modern Baptists grew out of English 
Separatist Puritanism of the early 1600s. The Separatists were con¬ 
vinced that the Anglican Church was a false church and desired to 
separate themselves from it. They founded a church of believers, 
made up only of those who could profess personal faith in Christ. 
Members constituted the church on the basis of a covenant with 
God and one another. 
Under the leadership of John Smyth a group of Separate Baptists 
fled to Holland in 1608. There they became convinced that baptism 
was to be given only after persons experienced personal faith in 
Christ (the Separatist Puritans continued the baptism of infants). 
Around 1609, Smyth baptized himself and the other members of 
his small congregation, and the first recognizable Baptist church 
was born. By 1612, a group of them had returned to England and 
churches soon spread throughout Great Britain. Many scholars sup¬ 
port this theory as the clearest explanation of Baptist origins.4

Baptist Beliefs: 
Doctrinal Positions 
These early English believers were later known as General Bap¬ 
tists, because of their belief that Christ died for all persons (general 
atonement). They subscribed to the views of Jacob Arminius, the 
Dutch theologian, who proposed an alternative to the hyper-Calvin¬ 
ism and predestinarian views prevalent in many Protestant churches 
in the seventeenth century. 
The General Baptists believed that God would save all who came 
to Him by repentance and faith. This salvation was available to those 
who responded to God’s grace by an act of their free will. Men 
and women were, therefore, free to choose, reject, or ignore the 
grace of God. If the human will could actively choose Christ, it 
was also free to reject Him later on. Thus, General Baptists believed 
that it Was possible to “fall from grace” and reject the salvation 
which one had once possessed. General and Free Will Baptists con¬ 
tinue to hold this doctrine. 
The Calvinist perspective was represented by the Particular Bap¬ 
tists, who suggested that Christ’s death applied only to an elect 
minority. All persons were totally depraved and could be saved only 
by the grace of God. If and when grace was given, the individual 
could not resist it. God was sovereign, and salvation came only from 
Him. The atonement of Christ applied only to those who were 
elected by God to salvation. Primitive and Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit- 
Predestinarian Baptists represent this view. 
The Particular Baptists are credited by many scholars with estab¬ 
lishing immersion as the basic method of baptism in Baptist 
churches. This probably began around 1641 in England, and took 
the form of dipping the whole body in water as a sign of burial 
and resurrection with Christ. Prior to that time, the method of bap¬ 
tism was by afflusion, the pouring of water on the head of the new 
convert. 
Baptists in America: 
Persecution and Growth 
Baptists generally trace their American roots to that perennial 
religious radical, Roger Williams, who came to Massachusetts in 
1631 as a Separatist Puritan preacher. His abrasive personality, his 
criticisms of Puritan intolerance, and their exploitation of the Indians 
led to his exile from that colony in 1636. Given sanctuary by the 
Narragansett Indians, Williams purchased land from them, founding

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
434 
Rhode Island as a haven for other dissenters. Williams was also 
instrumental in the establishing of the First Baptist Church in Amer¬ 
ica at Providence, probably in 1639. While soon rejecting Baptist 
views to become a “Seeker,” awaiting some new revelation, Williams 
was an important influence on early American Baptists. Others came 
to Rhode Island and by 1641 a congregation was founded at New¬ 
port. These churches were Calvinistic in theology. Indeed, Calvinism 
was a major influence upon colonial Baptists. Persecution of Baptists 
continued in Massachusetts and Connecticut, while Baptist churches 
spread to the middle colonies, particularly Pennsylvania. 
Baptists headed south in the 1690s and founded what is now 
the First Baptist Church of Charleston, South Carolina. The congre¬ 
gation was made up of immigrants from England and Maine, some 
of whom shared both General and Particular Baptist views. The 
first pastor, William Screven, who arrived in 1696, was a Particular 
Baptist who shaped the Calvinistic direction of the church and suc¬ 
ceeding churches which spread into certain parts of the South. These 
“old” Baptist churches, with their Calvinistic theology, educated 
clergy and ordered worship later characterized by Baptists in the 
more urban, aristocratic arenas of southern life. 
Another source of Baptist influence in the South came from the 
Separate Baptists of the first Great Awakening. The awakening, 
which reached its height in the 1740s, was a period of religious 
enthusiasm characterized by emotional worship services, dramatic 
conversions, and exuberant preaching. Presbyterians, Congregation- 
alists, Baptists, and other religious groups were affected by these 
revivals. 
Many Baptists were divided over the emotionalism and methods 
of the awakening. The Regular Baptists looked with suspicion upon 
revival techniques, favoring the more traditional ways of preaching 
and conversion. The Separate Baptists were those who supported 
the actions of revivalists and advocated a more aggressive style of 
evangelism. 
In !755> a group of Separate Baptists came from New England 
to Sandy Creek, North Carolina. Led by two preachers, Shubal 
Stearns and Daniel Marshall, these Separates formed the Sandy 
Creek Baptist Church. Within the next twenty years it became the 
mother church of some forty-two churches. 
The Separate Baptists brought their revivalisdc preaching and 
conversionalisdc theology into the South. The churches of Appala¬ 
chia have been greatly affected by this strong emphasis on personal 
evangelism. 
Separate Baptist churches spread rapidly in Virginia, where the 

============================================================
PAGE 437
============================================================

435 
preachers frequently came in contact with the long arm of the law 
over their refusal to adhere to laws regulating the relationship of 
church and state. In Virginia, where the Anglican Church was the 
official religion, non-Anglican preachers had to secure licenses from 
the state. All citizens, Anglican or not, were taxed for support of 
the Anglican establishment. When Baptists and others refused to 
secure the proper licenses or attacked the established church, they 
were harassed and often imprisoned by the authorities. Increasingly 
Baptists supported separation of church and state in Virginia and 
throughout the colonies. 
The Baptist Ministry in the Mountains: 
The Farmer-Preacher 
As Baptist churches were established in the southern highlands 
and other frontier areas, they turned for leadership to the farmer- 
preacher, an individual who reflected the practical situation and met 
the spiritual needs of the mountain churches. These early pastors 
were men who settled in the mountains, worked their land during 
the week, exercising their ministerial calling alongside their physical 
labor. They were often laymen, converted in revivals and “called” 
to preach. With the autonomy of Baptist congregations they could 
found churches wherever they could gather a group. The church 
acknowledged their leadership and often that was ordination 
enough. Sometimes they were licensed to preach, sometimes for¬ 
mally ordained in the presence of other ordained church leaders, 
and sometimes they had no formal ordination beyond recognition 
of the local church. 
Most of these men had little formal education; some could not 
read at all. But they could preach, visit, offer hope to the sick and 
the dying and for those not necessarily educated or sophisticated, 
those were the primary pastorly gifts. In fact, Appalachian Baptists 
have long been suspicious of education for the clergy lest it interfere 
with the simple preaching of heart religion. While this view is chang¬ 
ing in many Baptist churches, some still warn that college and semi¬ 
nary “ruined many a good preacher.” Others hope that head learning 
will enhance, not destroy, genuine piety. 
The other officer of a Baptist church is the deacon, elected by 
the congregation on the basis of such biblical criteria as I Timothy 
3:8—13. Deacons are laypersons who assist the pastor in worship 
services, particularly in the distribution of the Lord’s Supper and 

============================================================
PAGE 438
============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
436 
in care for the physical and spiritual needs of the church members. 
Deacons help to guide the church, see to its financial condition, 
and watch after the poor and the sick. The interaction between 
deacons and pastors has sometimes been a source of tension, which 
can lead divisons in Baptist churches. 
Baptist Denominations: 
Their Name Is Legion 
Though Baptist churches in the southern mountains and elsewhere 
shared many common qualities of practice and church order, there 
were also many differences. Baptists disagreed over such issues as 
denominational alignment versus independence; falling from grace 
versus eternal security; general versus particular theories of Christ’s 
atonement; and missions versus anti-mission emphasis. The follow¬ 
ing is a brief sketch of different types of Baptists found in Appalachia. 
The Southern Baptist Convention 
Churches associated with the Southern Baptist Convention are 
perhaps the most numerous Baptist churches in Appalachia and in 
the South. Beginning in 1845, the slavery controversy and the 
developing sectionalism of the pre-Civil War era, Southern Baptists 
are today the largest Protestant denomination in America, number¬ 
ing some thirteen million persons. 
The split with the Northern Baptists (now American Baptist 
Churches, USA) culminated a lengthy debate over the role of mission 
boards in dictating policies affecting local congregations. The central 
issue was in the decision of the Baptist mission boards, home and 
foreign, not to appoint slaveholders to the mission field. Southern¬ 
ers, already angry at the force of northern abolitionist sentiment, 
insisted that this was an extraneous issue and that no outside body 
could dictate policy to autonomous congregations. 
Aggressively evangelistic and deeply concerned to spread the gos¬ 
pel around the world, Southern Baptists grew rapidly across the 
South and Southwest following the Civil War. As already noted, 
they became the dominant Protestant force in southern culture. They 
have maintained, not without struggle, the autonomy of local 
churches, while developing a powerful centralized organization for 
missionary and other endeavors. 
Authority in the SBC is said to originate “from the bottom up,’’ 
rather than at the top of a hierarchy. Denominational gatherings, 
on local, state, or national levels, are made up of “messengers” 
elected by local churches. 

============================================================
PAGE 439
============================================================

APPENDIX 
437 
The association, a gathering of churches in a given region for 
fellowship, cooperation, and mission action, is the most basic form 
of Baptist unity. State conventions are formed by local churches 
in a particular state. Messengers from individual congregations pro¬ 
vide representation to the yearly meeting of the Southern Baptist 
Convention itself. So basic is local autonomy that individual churches 
may be removed from membership in one group—association, state, 
or national convention—without automatically losing membership 
in another. 
The strong concern for local autonomy has meant that there is 
tremendous diversity in the SBC itself. Churches in close proximity 
may have very different approaches to worship, ethics, ministry, and 
evangelism. 
The basis of this unity in diversity among Southern Baptists is, 
first and foremost, missions. By means of a “Cooperative Program,” 
local congregations contribute funds which are used in associations 
and state and national conventions to underwrite a wide variety of 
mission endeavors. On the convention-wide level these financial re¬ 
sources provide for the work of the home and foreign mission 
boards, a Sunday school board which produces masses of literature 
for use in churches, six seminaries coast to coast for the training 
of ministers, and a multitude of other commissions and agencies. 
No church is compelled to give a prescribed amount to the Coopera¬ 
tive Program, though giving for mission work is greatly encouraged 
throughout the convention. Southern Baptist churches in Appalachia 
reflect the diversity of churches convention-wide. All these churches, 
however, will likely be concerned for personal evangelism, missions, 
and the unique Baptist witness in the community and the world. 
Because of their concern for missions, southern Baptists in Appala¬ 
chia are frequently known as “Missionary Baptists.” 
Southern Baptist Beliefs 
Historically, Southern Baptists are pietistic evangelicals, con¬ 
cerned for the personal regeneration of every person through faith 
in Jesus Christ. Regeneration occurs at conversion, a dramatic event 
when the individual exercises faith in Christ as personal savior and 
experiences the gift of God’s saving grace. 
Conversion is formally registered by “public profession of faith,” 
usually by “walking the aisle” during a revival or regular service 
of worship. Baptism by immersion follows as a symbol of the believ¬ 
er’s inward transformation. Each new Christian is urged, and often 
instructed, to share the faith with others, and personal witness is 
a vital concern of most Southern Baptist congregations. 

============================================================
PAGE 440

FOXFIRE 7 
438 
Theologically, Southern Baptists frequently refer to themselves 
as “modified Calvinists.” By this they mean that salvation is by God’s 
grace, but requires the cooperation of individual free will. The true 
convert is eternally secure and cannot lose salvation or “fall from 
grace.” The idea of the eternal security of the believer is frequently 
popularized in the phrase “once saved, always saved.” This belief 
has been a frequent topic of debate among Baptists and other de¬ 
nominations. 
Doctrinally, Southern Baptists are conservative but not necessarily 
fundamentalist. Traditionally they have permitted some latitude in 
matters of dogma as long as cooperating individuals and churches 
could affirm the reality of a personal faith and a commitment to 
Baptist efforts of world evangelism. 
While hesitant to develop creeds which might threaten the author¬ 
ity of scripture, Southern Baptists have preferred to express doctrinal 
sentiments in confessions of faith. These documents normally serve 
as guidelines for churches, but are not binding on the conscience 
of the individual. 
The official confession of faith now used by Southern Baptists 
is the Baptist Faith and Message statement approved in 1963 at 
Kansas City. Its articles deal with issues as scripture, religious liberty, 
and the final judgment. In recent years, this document has been 
used by some groups in the SBC as a formal statement of dogma 
to be rigidly interpreted. One of the major issues confronting South¬ 
ern Baptists is whether or not they can maintain both diversity and 
unity in the midst of controversies over doctrine, creeds, and funda¬ 
mentalist debates. 
Independent Baptists 
Fundamentalism represents the primary doctrinal position of an¬ 
other type of Baptist in Appalachia, the independent. Independent 
churches maintain no official denominational affiliations beyond the 
individual congregation. Given Baptist obsession with autonomy and 
the rugged individualism of the mountains, as well as the tendency 
toward competition and doctrinal debate, it is no surprise that inde¬ 
pendent churches flourish in Appalachia. Many of these congrega¬ 
tions are formed around a charismatic, often autocratic, pastor; some 
grow out of splits with other churches; others are constituted from 
churches once in the SBC or other denominations. 
A major influence on the development of independent Baptist 
churches was the debate over mission boards. Some Baptists op¬ 
posed such boards as a threat to local autonomy, fearing that outside 

============================================================
PAGE 441
============================================================

439 
agencies could dictate mission policies to local churches. Indepen¬ 
dent Baptists generally believe in missions but favor the direct sup¬ 
port of individual missionaries sent out or funded by the local church 
alone. Elaborate administrative structures for regulating mission ac¬ 
tivities are rejected as wasteful and harmful to the authority of the 
local church. 
Independent churches are usually quite strong in their Landmark 
emphasis. They are vocal in their opposition to ecumenical endeav¬ 
ors, seeking to retain baptismal and communal purity. They normally 
practice “close communion,” and require re-immersion of those 
whose earlier baptism does not conform closely with their own. 
While they are rabidly evangelistic and aggressive in personal wit¬ 
nessing, independents also tend toward a strong doctrinal rigidity. 
Fundamentalist dogmas regarding biblical inerrancy, personal devil, 
virgin birth, bodily resurrection, and a premillennial theory of 
Christ’s second coming are prominent doctrines among independent 
Baptist congregations. Although they respond to the physical needs 
of individuals in church and community, most independent Baptists 
would fiercely attack the “social gospel” as obscuring the church’s 
primary task: the salvation of “lost” men and women. Worship in 
independent churches tends to be informal, folksy, and unrehearsed. 
Sermons are loud and long, with a major emphasis on the need 
for immediate conversion. Threats of hell, promises of heaven, invi¬ 
tations to receive Christ before it is too late, promises of heaven, 
invitations to receive Christ before it is too late, attacks on worldli¬ 
ness and personal immorality characterize most sermons. Indepen¬ 
dent Baptists tend to be intense about their faith and in their sense 
of right and wrong. They often disagree among themselves and 
with other Christians, but they tend to grow large and enthusiastic 
churches. 
Primitive Baptists 
The Primitive or “Hardshell” Baptists represent the Calvinistic 
or even hyper-Calvinistic wing of Baptist denominations. They came 
to the mountains relatively early. Disagreements over missions, Bible 
societies, and seminaries led to the beginning of the Primitive Baptist 
movement in North Carolina in 1827. The initial division was fol¬ 
lowed by numerous splits over the nature of predestination, new 
birth, music, offerings, and other issues. Their church life is charac¬ 
terized by local autonomy with some loose-knit associational and 
national organization. It reflects little of the elaborate structure of 
Southern Baptist denominationalism. Like other Baptists they stress 

============================================================
PAGE 442
============================================================

440 
FOXFIRE 7 
the authority of scripture, the importance of baptismal immersion, 
and congregational polity. Beyond these basic similarities the Primi¬ 
tives part company with most other evangelical Baptists. For Primi¬ 
tive Baptists, God is sovereign and his ways “past finding out.” 
Salvation, therefore, is completely the work of God’s grace. Sinful 
human beings can do nothing to facilitate their salvation. Men and 
women by nature are unconcerned about redemption and incapable 
of discovering God for themselves. For Primitive Baptists the doc¬ 
trine of election means that God has chosen some individuals for 
salvation, while others have not received grace or have received 
election to damnation. How and when predestination of the elect 
occurred is a matter of debate among Baptists and other Calvinist 
groups. 
Some supralapserian Primitive Baptists believe that even before 
the fall of Adam, God had elected some persons to salvation and 
others to damnation. Thus, He caused the fall in order that He 
might save the elect. Others, who might be called infralapserian 
Primitive Baptists believe that God elected individuals only after 
the fall. 
Whatever the terms of the process, neither the elect nor the 
damned have any reason to boast or complain, as salvation lies 
solely with God. The elect are saved only by grace, unconditionally, 
and not on the basis of any good they do or gifts they exhibit. 
The damned are totally depraved and, thus, deserve nothing but 
damnation. God’s Sovereignty, His decision to save some and damn 
others, is beyond human comprehension. Christ’s death, therefore, 
was efficacious only for the elect, not for the entire race. This hyper- 
Calvinism is a far cry from the doctrines of the sixteenth reformer 
of Geneva, John Calvin, but it has greatly influenced the life and 
practice of Primitive Baptist churches. 
Unlike most other Baptist groups, Primitive Baptists are not ag¬ 
gressively evangelistic. They preach the gospel of election and re¬ 
demption in their churches, but believe that God in His good time 
will awaken all the elect to salvation. They hesitate to preach revivals 
or evangelistic meetings calling for conversion, and prefer to allow 
the sovereign God to save whom He will. 
Primitives believe the church to be the fellowship of the elect, 
the community of faith. They usually practice foot washing, along 
with baptism and the Supper, as ordinances of the church. 
Primitive Baptists keep ecclesiastical organization to a minimum. 
They seldom take offerings and have few paid clergy. Preachers

work at secular vocations and serve congregations on Sunday. Many 
churches have no Sunday school or other services beyond preaching 
and worship. The use of organs, pianos, or other musical instruments 
is frowned upon in many of the churches. 
Free Will Baptists 
The Free Will Baptists occupy the other end of the spectrum 
from the Primitives. They began in North Carolina around 1727 
under the leadership of Paul Palmer. Palmer preached a doctrine 
of free grace, free will, and free salvation. Another Free Will group 
was begun in New Hampshire by Benjamin Randall in 1780. These 
movements experienced continued division, particularly during the 
Civil War, but were united in 1935 into the National Association 
of Free Will Baptists.5 
This national organization supports limited work in both foreign 
and home missions, with denominational offices in Nashville, Ten¬ 
nessee. Most Free Will Baptist churches practice three ordinances: 
immersion baptism, Lord’s Supper, and foot washing. They stress 
local autonomy and congregational church government. Theologi¬ 
cally, they represent the strongest commitment to Arminianism evi¬ 
dent among Baptist groups. The grace of God is for all persons 
who respond to the gospel demands for repentance and faith. Thus 
all are potentially in the elect. Although tainted with sin, all human 
beings have the free will to move toward God and respond to His 
grace. Since the human will is free to choose Christ, it also remains 
free to reject Him at some future time. Free Will Baptists thus main¬ 
tain the possibility of “falling from grace” or willfully repudiating 
one’s salvation. 
The Free Will Baptists are evangelistic in their preaching and 
active in efforts at personal witnessing. Their services are warm 
and folksy, ordered but not formal. Their views on falling from 
grace have led to frequent debates with those other Baptist groups 
which preach doctrines of eternal security and perseverance of the 
saints. 
Baptists are truly a unique lot! Critics of the Free Will Baptists 
could sing: 
Baptist, Baptist, Baptist, 
Baptist once for all, 
I’ll always be a Baptist 
Unless, of course, I fall.

The Black Baptist Tradition 
There are many Baptist groups in America made up primarily 
of Blacks. These denominations began in the post-slavery era as 
Blacks separated from the white churches, where they had previously 
been members, and established their own organizations outside the 
domination of whites. Baptist church autonomy and congregational 
government was conducive to the establishment of independent 
Black churches in both the North and the South. These congrega¬ 
tions were usually served by itinerant Black farmer-preachers, nor¬ 
mally unpaid and lacking formal education. 
The first national organization of Black Baptists was formed in 
1880 as the Foreign Mission Baptist Convention in Montgomery, 
Alabama. The American National Baptist Convention followed, es¬ 
tablished at St. Louis in 1886, and the Baptist National Education 
Convention was founded at Washington, D.C. in 1893. These three 
groups were united in the formation of the National Baptist Conven¬ 
tion in 1895.1 
Divisions have plagued the Black Baptist churches, beginning as 
early as 1915, over the use of a charter and the formation of a 
publishing house. This division led to the formation of the National 
Baptist Convention of America and the National Baptist Convention 
of the USA, Incorporated. The latter body maintains a publishing 
house. In 1961, the National Baptist Convention Incorporated was 
again divided and the Progressive Baptist Convention founded. 
The Black Baptist churches are firm in their commitment to the 
autonomy of the local church and, quite often, the position of the 
pastor as the authoritative “shepherd of the flock.” Like their white 
counterparts, the Black Baptists of Appalachia are experiencing 
change and controversy as their ministers increasingly receive educa¬ 
tion in colleges and seminaries. 
Worship in these churches is exuberant and spontaneous, with 
a strong emphasis on the centrality of preaching. Worship is an 
“event” which is not limited by the boundaries of time or schedule. 
Black churches continue to retain the tradition of the “answering 
congregation,” in which the people respond freely and audibly to 
the proclamation of the minister. Shouting, singing, tears, and other 
physical responses are not uncommon within the worship services. 
In many areas of the country, including Appalachia, the church 
continues to be a place where Blacks can exercise leadership gifts 
in ways not always available in the white-dominated society as a 
whole. At the same time, however, Appalachian Baptists, Black and

white, share many common characteristics and practices. Some Black 
Baptist congregations are beginning to accept “dual affiliation” with 
American or Southern Baptist denominations. 
Baptists are diverse. No doubt this brief chapter has omitted some¬ 
thing which readers see as crucial to an understanding of Baptists. 
Baptists often make up in fervor what they lack in consistency. 
ROMAN CATHOLICS 
Roman Catholicism began slowly in America. Although some of 
the earliest explorers of the sixteenth century brought their Catholi¬ 
cism with them and founded churches in the Southwest and the 
North, Catholics were a minority among the English-speaking colo¬ 
nists. Maryland was an early center of Catholic influence in America, 
chartered by the Calvert family, who extended religious tolerance 
to non-Catholics in order to attract colonists. A member of another 
distinguished Maryland family, John Carroll, was consecrated arch¬ 
bishop of Baltimore in 1808, the first Catholic bishop in America. 
Nonetheless, the church was slow to grow in the midst of the Protes¬ 
tant establishment. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that 
the church began to experience phenomenal growth as multitudes 
of immigrants—many of them European Catholics—descended upon 
America, introducing a new and powerful force into American reli¬ 
gion. Their numbers, their non-Anglo traditions and their “foreign” 
religion were seen by many ‘Too percent Americans” as a threat 
to the American and Protestant way of life. 
This and-Catholic sentiment, or nativism, was particularly strong 
in many northern industrial areas where the immigrants congre¬ 
gated, providing cheap labor and a “papist” faith. It was also true 
in the Protestant South, not because there were large numbers of 
Catholics, but because Catholicism was characterized as the ultimate 
enemy of “Bible-believing,” born-again Christians. Many southern 
preachers denounced the evils of creeping Catholicism bent on turn¬ 
ing Christians from faith in Christ to subservience to a Roman pope. 
Many still reveal a strong bias toward Catholic doctrines and prac¬ 
tices. The Ku Klux Klan sometimes targeted Catholics as well as 
Blacks for harassment with cross-burning and other fear tactics. 
Many evangelical groups consider Catholics to be “lost,” outside 
Christian salvation, who need to be won to Christianity and away 
from Catholic influence. Many Appalachian preachers label the pope

as antichrist and warn of plots to impose Catholic views on the 
society and the churches in America. This argument was particularly 
strong during the presidential campaigns of Catholics A1 Smith in 
1928 and John Kennedy in i960. Protestant pulpits and periodicals 
thundered with warnings of papal control of the presidency, destruc¬ 
tion of religious liberty, and the loss of separation of church and 
state. 
During those years the Catholics, themselves, sometimes seemed 
their own worst enemies. Papal decrees condemned public educa¬ 
tion, democracy, and freedom of religion. Protestant missionaries 
in predominately Catholic countries were harassed and the church 
made highly publicized claims for papal infallibility and Roman supe¬ 
riority as the true church. The people of the South and the highlands 
were particularly susceptible to the negative aspects of Catholicism, 
as there were few Catholics around and the popular stereotypes 
helped make an obvious enemy for preachers to attack. Indeed 
in 1973> when the American Catholic Church reported some 
48,465,438 members, the two geographical areas which showed the 
smallest percentage of Catholics were the Baptist South and the 
Methodist “southern North.”1 Baptists might disagree over Baptist 
doctrine or moral issues or Baptist politics, but they could all agree 
that Catholics were wrong and far off from the truth. 
The situation began to change in i960 when John Kennedy was 
elected President of the United States and the capital was not moved 
to Rome. Kennedy’s commitment to American freedoms dispelled, 
for some at least, fears of direct papal influence in American politics. 
(Catholics themselves were a formidable political force nonetheless.) 
A second major influence on the changing attitude of and toward 
Catholics was due to the Second Vatican Council, called in 1961 
by the beloved Pope John XXIII. The changes in worship, biblical 
studies, parish life, and church order profoundly affected Catholics 
and the Protestant view of the Roman church. Vernacular mass, a 
revival interest in preaching, lay participation, scripture study, and 
communion given to the people in both elements, along with some 
new appreciation for ecumenical endeavors led many to label the 
reform as more Protestant in emphasis. Others responded that it 
merely made the church more Catholic, calling it to move beyond 
the encrustations of the Middle Ages and the modern siege mentality 
to the practices of the earliest Christian communities. 
Third, the growing pluralism and mobility of Americans meant 
that Catholics now moved into the South, intermarried more easily 
with Protestants and participated in more cooperative endeavors.

Thus, the church struggles to succeed in the mountains fighting 
critics on both sides. Some have left because it has ceased to be 
“church” without Latin mass, surefire doctrines, and the security 
of unchanging faith. Others continue to warn of the danger of com¬ 
promise with the forces of the papacy—continuing anti-Catholic cam¬ 
paigns. 
Interestingly enough, some have seen parallels between southern 
religion (particularly Southern Baptists) and the religious traditions 
of Roman Catholicism. Sam Hill notes at least four such similarities: 
1. Both are committed to the spread of “their own institutional 
brand of Christianity”; 2. both stress the need “to conserve dogma, 
particularly old forms of old dogma”; 3. both tend to be “ingrown” 
separated from “the broader Christian community”; and 4. both 
have dominated their cultural setting with little tendency to become 
“self-critical and reformist.”2 
Nonetheless, Catholic beliefs are in many respects quite unique 
from Protestants’, particularly Appalachians’. No effort can be made 
to describe all the intricate facets of American Catholicism since 
space is limited. Basic doctrines are described here as an introduction 
to what Catholics really believe. A summary might be developed 
around the following areas: authority, salvation, worship, and transi¬ 
tion. 
Authority is a primary issue among Roman Catholics. The church 
itself—apostolic and universal—is the agent of God’s grace in the 
world. The church possesses true doctrine and is the guardian of 
that doctrine in the world. It continues the work of Jesus Christ 
on earth. As such, the Holy Spirit guides the church by two equally 
important sources: scripture (Old and New Testaments) and tradi¬ 
tion (the authoritative pronouncements of church councils, popes, 
and ecclesiastical laws). Scripture is primary, but scripture as inter¬ 
preted and enlightened by the tradition and continuing heritage 
of the church. 
For Catholics, the government of the church has also been formed 
by God through ancient traditions and practices. The church is gov¬ 
erned by a hierarchy, a “chain of command,” which interprets doc¬ 
trine, administers church affairs, and provides the authority for the 
church’s activity of grace in the world. The hierarchy begins with 
the pope who is the vicar (the chief representative) of Christ on 
earth. He is the successor of St. Peter and, thus, represents the 
truth of church dogma as passed on from the first-century Christian 
community to the present. Through Peter and his successors was 
given the authority of Jesus Christ. Christ said to Peter: 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
446 
Upon this rock I will build My church and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it and I will give to you the keys of 
the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever you bind on earth will 
be bound in heaven; whosoever you loose on earth will be loosed 
in heaven. 
(Matthew 16:18-19) 
Peter and his successors possess the “power of the keys” to govern 
the church spiritually and temporally. 
The pope is considered infallible only when he speaks “ex cathe¬ 
dra” from his office as Christ’s representative and only on matters 
of “faith and morals.” Contrary to some popular caricatures, the 
pope is not considered “perfect” nor infallible in every pronounce¬ 
ment. Few papal statements have been made “ex cathedra” since 
the doctrine was officially approved at Vatican Council I in 1870. 
The pope is the bishop of Rome and is chief bishop among all 
other bishops. The office of bishop, however, is the church’s chief 
spiritual and administrative office. The bishop stands in a line directly 
from the apostles Catholics believe. It is by his authority that the 
church administers its sacraments and cares for the faithful. Bishops 
oversee Catholic work in regional areas throughout the world. In¬ 
creasingly since the 1960s they have played a larger role in the 
overall governing of the church through their role as advisors to 
the pope. 
Priests or presbyters form the most basic ministerial position in 
the hierarchy. They carry out the ministry of the church on the 
local or parish level. To them, through the authority of the bishop, 
is given the power to bring the sacramental grace of the church 
to the people of God. Priests serve as pastors of local Catholic 
churches and provide other basic administrative and ministerial ser¬ 
vices. 
From the hierarchy the “community of faith” receives the teach¬ 
ings, doctrines, and sacraments of the church. Lay persons partici¬ 
pate in various local and regional affairs of the church but their 
role is distinct and separate from the role of those persons (clergy) 
duly ordained to carry out spiritual functions in the church. Since 
Vatican II, however, lay persons have taken a broader role in the 
ministry and administration of the church. 
A second realm of distinct Catholic doctrine concerns salvation 
and the living out of the Christian life. In Catholic thought, salvation 
is a process which begins at baptism (usually administered to infants) 
and continues until death. Throughout this process the church makes 
available various “signs” of God’s grace which nurture the Christian

in the faith. These “signs” are best known as sacraments: “visible 
and outward signs of a spiritual and inward grace.” Through the 
grace of the sacraments, the faith of the individual and the resulting 
good works, human beings secure salvation and new life in Christ. 
This idea of process and the cooperation of faith and works for 
salvation is probably the most difficult aspect for Protestants, particu¬ 
larly in the South, to understand. There is no one experience which 
brings immediate salvation. Though such experiences may occur, 
the process of salvation is life long, not once and for all. 
The sacraments of the church are seven in number. They are 
“mysteries,” whereby the grace of God comes to sinful human beings 
as mediated by the priest. They include: 
1. Baptism: Entrance into the church; the gift of “new birth”; 
old life put off and new life put on. Administered to infants and 
adult converts. 
2. Confirmation: The faith pledged at baptism is internalized 
by the individual. At infant baptism, faith is pledged by adults, at 
confirmation, the baptized individual makes faith his or her own. 
3. Communion (the mass): The continuing experience of grace. 
Catholics take Jesus’ words, “This is my body,” very literally, believ¬ 
ing that by the mystery of consecration, the bread and wine of com¬ 
munion become the very body and blood of Christ. Believers, thus, 
literally feed on Christ and receive his life into themselves. This is 
known as transubstantiation. 
4. Marriage: The grace of God in marriage, sanctifying this 
unique human relationship around which the family is formed. 
5. Holy Orders (ordination): A special grace is given to those 
who minister and mediate the grace of God to the church. 
6. Penance: The forgiveness of sins committed after baptism 
is provided for those who confess, repent, and do acts of restitution. 
Again, the priest is the vehicle of grace who speaks in Christ’s name 
the words, “Go on your way, your sins are forgiven.” 
7. Extreme Unction (last rites): The dying are anointed with 
oil and prayers are said to prepare the individual for death. 
Salvation then is process. The church through the sacraments 
nurtures persons by the grace of God throughout the journey of 
life. Christ’s death and resurrection are celebrated, recalled, and 
made tangible for the church in every age. 
A third quality of Roman Catholic life is worship. The liturgy of

the mass, the prayers of the faithful, the Divine office are central 
aspects of the Catholic community. The mass is the daily and weekly 
worship celebration. It follows a basic order with prayers, scripture, 
sermon (usually brief), confession, absolution, consecration of the 
elements, communion, and benediction. For centuries, the mass was 
said in Latin in every Catholic church throughout the world. Since 
the 1960s, it has been changed to the vernacular, the language of 
the people. This has led to increased participation of the laity in 
worship. Lay readers read scripture lessons, lead in prayers, and 
offer homilies (sermons). Congregational singing has increased and 
some laity may even help distribute communion under special cir¬ 
cumstances. Catholic worship is highly structured and the priest 
continues to play the central role, but there is variety, particularly 
in response to ethnic and social customs, music, and dress. In many 
churches communion is given to the faithful in both bread and wine 
(a departure from the past), and received in the hand not on the 
tongue. 
Thus the Catholic church is in a significant period of transition. 
Changes since Vatican II have been significant. There is a renewal 
of interest in Bible study, lay involvement, and spiritual life. In fact, 
a strong charismatic or neo-pentecostal movement has flourished 
among many faithful, contemporary Catholics. Changes in the 
church have produced controversy and some conservative reaction 
as groups seek to return to the more traditional and truly “Catholic” 
practices. Where these changes and reactions will take the church 
is difficult to foretell. It may be, however, that the transitions within 
the church have made it more acceptable in certain areas such as 
the South and Appalachia. At the same time, mobility and pluralism 
may help to make the mountains a more open area to diverse reli¬ 
gious groups than ever before. 
Catholicism, a changing Catholicism, is present in the southern 
highlands. What its impact will be and how other Christian groups, 
many still strongly anti-Catholic, will respond to it remains to be 
seen. 
CHURCHES OF CHRIST 
The Churches of Christ represent one segment of the “Disciples” 
or Christian” movement, one of the earliest indigenous denomina¬ 
tions in American religious history. While developing out of the 
frontier revivals of the nineteenth century, they insist on a “restora¬ 
tion” approach to the church. In their view, the true Church of 

============================================================

Christ was obscured for centuries by the multiple sects and denomi¬ 
nation. These false churches departed from the biblical teachings 
of Christ and the first Christians, giving way to apostasy.1 The teach¬ 
ings were restored and the church recovered in the work of a new 
generation of disciples. 
Barton W. Stone and The "Christians” 
Barton W. Stone was one of those early disciples. A Presbyterian 
pastor of the church at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, Stone called the 
infamous camp meeting held there in August 1801. Out of the fer¬ 
ment of his religious awakening, Stone rejected the creedal and 
predestinarian positions of the Presbyterians in an effort to reconsti¬ 
tute a church based only on the Bible. In 1804, Stone and others 
wrote the “Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery,” 
in which they affirmed certain “Christian” principles including the 
Bible as their only guide, no ordination for ministers, congregational 
church government, and an Arminian theology.2 The movement was 
highly evangelistic and spread rapidly across the frontier. 
Alexander Campbell and the "Disciples” 
Another faction involved in the frontier revivals was represented 
by Thomas and Alexander Campbell and a group which took the 
name, “Disciples of Christ.” Like Stone, Thomas Campbell was a 
Presbyterian preacher who became disillusioned with the theology 
and practice of that denomination. In 1809, he organized a non- 
denominational group, which accepted this basic principle of biblical 
interpretation: “Where the Scriptures speak we speak; where the 
Scriptures are silent we are silent.”3 
The elder Campbell sought to develop Christian unity around 
the Bible and a set of simple doctrines, but his argumentative son, 
Alexander, expressed these beliefs in a more divisive manner. Alex¬ 
ander Campbell was an able debater who did not hesitate to point 
out the errors of the churches of Christendom. For a time the youn¬ 
ger Campbell was affiliated with the Redstone Baptist Association 
in Pennsylvania but broke with them in 1827. Through the publica¬ 
tion of such periodicals as The Christian Baptist and The Millennial 
Harbinger, Campbell’s views were circulated and found sympathetic 
response from many who were dissatisfied with the traditionalism 
of existing denominations. The “Disciples of Christ,” while initially 
seeking to abolish denominationalism, succeeded in becoming a new 
denomination in themselves.

Campbell and his followers sought to restore the true teaching 
of the New Testament church. They insisted on baptism by immer¬ 
sion, based on the controversial phrase “for the remission of sins.” 
They observed the Lord’s Supper each Sunday, affirmed congrega¬ 
tional polity and looked to the New Testament alone as the primary 
guide for the church.4 
Basic Beliefs 
The churches of the Disciples tradition hold many common beliefs 
with other mainline Protestants. They favor a regenerate church 
membership, baptismal immersion, memorial view of the Lord’s Sup¬ 
per, local autonomy, and religious liberty. 
Some identify their distinctiveness by the following statements: 
No book but the Bible 
No name but the divine 
No plea but the gospel 
No aim but to save 
In Christ—unity 
In opinions—liberty 
In all things—charity5 
Their basic principles include: 
1. No creed but the Bible, with particular emphasis on New Tes¬ 
tament revelation. 
2. Conversion based on a rational assent to the tenets of the 
gospel. 
3. Baptism as necessary for conversion through the “remission 
of sins.” It is an act of obedience by which salvation is completed. 
4. Little or no formal distinction between clergy and laity. Many 
reject formal ordination, calls, or special titles for clergy. 
5. The Lord’s Supper to be celebrated every Sunday as adminis¬ 
tered by any duly authorized member.6

Unity and Division 
451 
Although not agreeing on every doctrine, Stone, Campbell, and 
their followers agreed, in 1832, to cooperate together without es¬ 
tablishing a formal organization. Each group retained the name it 
preferred. Thus such terms as “Christian Church,” “Disciples of 
Christ,” or “Churches of Christ” were used by various churches 
identifying with the basic beliefs of Stone, Campbell, and other 
anti-denominationalists. They repudiated the titles, “Stonites” or 
“Campbellites” which their critics (who were many) placed upon 
them. 
In time, however, several distinct denominations were formed 
from this loosely knit movement. They included: The Christian 
Church, The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and the 
Churches of Christ. 
The Christian Church 
The Christian Church, prevalent in Indiana, Kentucky, and Ten¬ 
nessee, holds a middle position between the more conservative 
Church of Christ and the more liberal Disciples. The Christian 
Church was formed in 1924, due to disagreements with the Disciples 
over more ecumenical endeavors and baptismal policies. The Chris¬ 
tian Churches are more cautious in their ecumenical involvements 
and less likely to accept members who have not been baptized by 
immersion. 
The Disciples of Christ 
The Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ) International Con¬ 
vention took its present name in 1957. Prior to that the church 
had grown out of the Stonite/Campbellite movement, with first offi¬ 
cial national convention and mission organization held in 1849. 
They seek to restore the practices of the New Testament church, 
insist on no creed but the Bible, and maintain a denominationalism 
bound by local autonomy. In recent years, Disciples have participated 
in ecumenical efforts and even joined in conferences on union with 
other denominations. They have tended to become more liturgically 
oriented in their larger congregations, placed more emphasis on 
educated ministry and have been accused of more “liberal” theology. 

============================================================
PAGE 454

452 
Churches of Christ 
FOXFIRE 7 
The Churches of Christ separated from the Disciples movement 
around 1906. They were particularly opposed to the development 
of missionary societies, favoring instead the support of missionaries 
directly through local congregations. They also rejected the use 
of musical instruments in services of worship. Such instruments were 
not explicitly permitted by the New Testament. Churches of Christ 
tend to be very concerned about Bible study and use the Bible 
extensively as proof for their doctrines and practices. They observe 
the Lord’s Supper each Sunday and their ministers serve with formal 
recognition of the congregation, but without ordination. Local au¬ 
tonomy is very strong and duly elected elders control much of the 
affairs of the church. 
Members of this community are often noble controversialists who 
debate other groups over biblical doctrines. This has led many to 
an unbending dogmatism which declares the dogmas of the 
Churches of Christ to be the only true doctrines of the church. 
They often demonstrate little patience with those whose doctrines 
differ from their own. As pluralism of education and region expands 
within the churches, doctrines also are expanded. Churches of Christ 
now face many questions regarding their approach to traditional 
dogmas, ecumenism, social action, and progressive ideas. 
EPISCOPALIANS 
The spontaneity of Pentecostal and Baptist worship services seems 
a far cry from the stately ritual of the Episcopal Church and its 
Book of Common Prayer. For many mountain evangelicals the nurturing 
and confirmation process of Episcopal evangelism seems foreign 
to conversionistic, “born-again” religion. The written prayers, the 
robed clergy, and the prescribed scriptures, are signs of institutional¬ 
ization, which many mountain preachers vehemently denounce. The 
Episcopal via media or middle way between Catholic liturgy and Prot¬ 
estant theology appears to many mountain fundamentalists as a com¬ 
promise in doctrine and an accommodation with the world. After 
all, Episcopalians do use real wine in the Lord’s Supper and have 
been known to use alcohol on less religious occasions as well! Fur¬ 
thermore, the Episcopal communion has often been identified with 
the wealthy and powerful, not the small farmers, sharecroppers, 
and disenfranchized people of the mountains. In earlier days, at

least, it was considered the religion of the gentry and that was reason 
enough for the less affluent to shun it. 
Nonetheless, Episcopal religion appeared in the southern high¬ 
lands. The church was brought there by a determined young priest 
who grew old seeking to minister to mountain folk in ways consistent 
with Episcopal tradition but responsive to the needs and distinctives 
of the region. In what may be one of the most valuable accounts 
in this volume, the story of Episcopal work in Appalachia, as recalled 
by one of its pioneers, is retold. 
American Anglicanism began in the South. When the first perma¬ 
nent English settlement was formed at Jamestown in 1607, its reli¬ 
gion was Anglican. During the colonial period the Anglican church 
was the official religion of numerous colonies including Virginia, 
Georgia, and the Carolinas. Anglican missionaries were sent to 
America by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign 
Parts. In addition to their work with the settlers, these clergymen 
also made some of the earliest efforts at converting the Indians 
and later at bringing Christianity to the Black African slaves. The 
work was difficult since clergy were few, farms and plantations were 
widespread, and there was no resident bishop to direct church affairs. 
The religion which these early Anglicans brought was that of a 
church established in 1536 through the struggles of King Henry 
VIII to provide the stability of a male heir for the English throne 
and the upstart Tudor dynasty. But the genius behind both Tudor 
and Anglican stability in England was not Henry’s sole male heir, 
Edward VI, who died before reaching adulthood. It was his daughter, 
the politically astute and religiously expedient Elizabeth I whose 
policies kept England Protestant and Anglican. Elizabeth, who ruled 
1558-1603, sought to steer a moderate course between pro-papal 
Catholicism and extreme Protestantism. During her reign, the thirty- 
nine articles were approved as the official confession of faith of 
the church. Theologically, the articles reflect Lutheran and Calvinis- 
tic views but with broad enough terms to permit a wide range of 
doctrinal interpretation. The liturgy of the church seems to be more 
Catholic in nature with a tendency toward elaborate ritual and care¬ 
fully structured worship. But the church is also diverse enough to 
allow “high church” Anglicans to stress the more ornate style of 
worship and “evangelical” Anglicans to utilize the same Prayer Book 
with less formal interpretations. 
As the church developed in America it was almost completely 
identified with the British and, therefore, with the Tory cause in 
the American Revolution. Following the American victory, colonial 
Anglicanism was in disarray, associated with the defeated enemy,

its clergy in exile or hiding, its organization splintered and revenues 
gone. After a period of frustration, division, and debate, the church 
was finally constituted into the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1784 
and following a complicated procedure, secured ordination of its 
first bishops from Anglicans in Great Britain. Under the leadership 
of two early bishops, Samuel Seabury and William White, the church 
sought to regroup and establish an American identity. Its govern¬ 
ment centers around a bicameral legislative body found in a house 
of bishops and a house of delegates made up of clergy and lay 
representatives. Its confession of faith is closely parallel to that of 
the thirty-nine articles. 
The Episcopal church has retained its image as the church of 
the wealthy and has often numbered the more affluent Americans 
among its members. In recent years, an effort to relate Episcopal 
ministry more closely to the poor and disenfranchized has met with 
both enthusiasm and opposition from members, creating debate 
and controversy within the church. American Episcopalians have 
sometimes been described as representative of one of three ecclesias¬ 
tical types: high church, broad church, and evangelical. The high 
church emphasis is on the beauty, dignity, and sacramentalism of 
the Anglican liturgy and worship. Evangelicals stress preaching, per¬ 
sonal spirituality, and conversion, while broad church Anglicans seek 
to incorporate both elements with particular concern for ministry 
to the social needs. These forces often overlap and are not clearly 
defined in many segments of the church. They do illustrate the 
church’s ability to adapt various situations and circumstances, 
however.1 
Episcopal Beliefs 
The Episcopal church places great emphasis on the nurture of 
individuals in faith through the teaching, worship, and sacraments 
of the church. Conversion is less likely to be a dramatic, once-for- 
all experience than a process whereby the individual grows in the 
“nurture and admonition” of God. The sacraments are, thus, very 
important as vehicles of God’s grace to the church. Through the 
sacraments, particularly baptism and the Lord’s Supper, persons 
are nurtured in faith and Christian living. 
Through baptism, normally given to infants, the individual be¬ 
comes a part of the church, the Body of Christ. That faith is pledged 
for infants by parents or godparents and confirmed by the individual 
in late childhood or early adolescence. The role of the church as 

============================================================
PAGE 457

455 
parent, aiding the development of faith in every member, is particu¬ 
larly important to Episcopalians. 
The Lord’s Supper is another significant nurturing event in the 
Episcopal church. As the church gathers at the table, sins are con¬ 
fessed, faith reaffirmed, and spiritual strength provided. The Supper 
is a memorial but it is more than that. For Episcopal communicants, 
Christ is mysteriously present in the sharing of communion in ways 
he is not experienced elsewhere in the life of the church. The bread 
and wine are not changed into Christ’s body and blood, but there 
is a new and unique experience of his presence as the elements 
are shared. Confirmation, penance, ordination, marriage, and last 
rites all have sacramental qualities in the life of the church. 
These sacraments are “outward and visible signs of an inward 
and visible grace.” They are to be administered only by those duly 
ordained priests of the church. The priest receives ordination in 
• succession from the apostles as transferred through the bishop. The 
bishop’s office (episcopacy) is the chief spiritual and administrative 
office of the church. Priests and deacons serve as the other orders 
of Episcopal ministers. 
The Episcopal church encourages “loyalty to the doctrine, disci¬ 
pline, and worship of the one holy Catholic Apostolic Church in 
all the essentials, but allows great liberty in nonessentials.”2 While 
maintaining elaborate hierarchy, and ecclesiastical tradition, it has 
also made room for a wide variety of doctrinal viewpoints. The 
Protestant Episcopal Church, USA, was the one denomination strong 
in both North and South which did not officially divide over the 
Civil War. Some organizational changes were made but no formal 
division occurred, a fact which aided the church in its own recon¬ 
struction after the war. More recently, however, questions over social 
action, the ordination of women, revision of the Prayer Book, and 
other liberalizing trends have led to increased debate and contro¬ 
versy among American Episcopalians. As the ecumenical movement 
progressed, Episcopalians have frequently appealed to their broad 
church tradition as a model for dialogues on Christian unity. Their 
claim to incorporate the best of many traditions would serve as a 
via media by which many groups might be united. 
Episcopal Churches in Appalachia 
The Episcopal church has had an important role in southern reli¬ 
gion. Its influence was particularly strong in the colonial period 
and prior to the Civil War. While it led in the early efforts at Chris-

tianizing slaves and has long been concerned with programs among 
the southern poor, the church has been identified with the upper 
economic and social classes. Its work in the southern highlands was 
slow, tedious, and rather late in developing. Through the work of 
the Reverend Rufus Morgan the growth of Episcopal churches in 
Appalachia is described and preserved. In this interview he tells 
his own story concerning the Episcopal presence in the southern 
highlands. 
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
Perhaps there is no more controversial religious group in the 
southern highlands than those who call themselves Jehovah’s Wit¬ 
nesses. They arrived in the mountains in the thirties and forties 
with a theology very different than that of the “mainline” Protestant 
denominations prominent in Appalachia. Their evangelism, their 
beliefs, and the extensive circulation of their literature has helped 
to make “JW’s” one of the fastest-growing religious bodies in the 
nation. 
The interview published here offers a basic summary of their be¬ 
liefs as explained by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This introduction 
represents an effort to provide a historical overview of the group 
as evidenced in its leaders and its most significant doctrines. 
While tracing their roots back to the Biblical period, Jehovah’s 
Witnesses acknowledge that the modem expression of their views 
began with the work of “Pastor” Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916) 
and a group of his followers known as International Bible Students. 
Russell was influenced by the Adventist movement of the late nine¬ 
teenth century but through systematic Bible study soon disagreed 
with their views that Christ would come in the flesh in 1874. He 
recognized that Jesus would return as a spirit, and so be present 
though invisible. (1 Pet. 3:18) This led Russell to the writing of a 
pamphlet entitled The Object and Manner of the Lord’s Return, of which 
some 50,000 copies were published. 
Russell briefly joined forces with another former Adventist, 
N. H. Barbour, and the two produced a book in 1877 called Three 
Worlds or Plan of Redemption. Nothing like it had ever been published 
before. It combined for the first time the explanations of time 
prophecies with the work of Restitution. At this early date they recog¬ 
nized that the end of Satan’s period of uninterrupted rule of the 
earth, called “Gentile Times” would come in 1914. 

============================================================

457 
By 1879, Russell had broken with Barbour to begin his own period¬ 
ical, Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence, now called The 
Watchtower. The first issue of Zion’s Watch Tower consisted of only 
about 6,000 copies. Today its circulation exceeds an average of 
8,750,000 copies per issue in over 106 languages. 
Marking 1881 was the formation of the “Watch Tower Tract Soci¬ 
ety,” which was incorporated under Pennsylvania law in 1884 as 
“Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society” (now called “Watchtower 
Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania”). Its charter states: The 
purpose for which the Corporation is formed is, the dissemination 
of Bible truths in various languages by means of the publication 
of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and 
by the use of all other lawful means which its Board of Directors, 
duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the furtherance of the 
purpose stated. This and other corporations of similar purpose are 
merely legal instruments used by Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
By 1880, Russell was the recognized leader of small congregations 
in the North and Northeast United States, particularly concentrated 
around Pittsburgh. Members were urged to give personal witness 
to their faith at every opportunity. In the early 1900s, the Bible 
Students organized an international newspaper syndicate. At one 
time about 3,000 newspapers in the United States, Canada, and 
Europe were publishing C. T. Russell’s sermons. 
In 1912, Russell determined to give a great witness through a 
new medium. Although motion pictures were still in their infancy 
he wrote and produced the Photo-Drama of Creation, an eight-hour- 
long slide, motion picture, and sound production outlining the di¬ 
vine purpose for the earth and mankind from creation down to 
the end of Jesus Christ’s thousand-year reign. (Rev. 20:6) Shown 
in four parts, the Photo-Drama combined phonograph recordings 
with slides and motion pictures. It was seen by millions. 
Charles Taze Russell died in October 1916 while on a preaching 
tour in Texas. Russell was succeeded by “Judge” Joseph F. Ruther¬ 
ford (1869-1942) who established the Witnesses in much of the 
doctrine by which they are known today. A lawyer by trade, Ruther¬ 
ford was known as Judge although he never officially held such an 
office. He read Russell’s literature, accepted the doctrines, and was 
baptized in 1906. 
During World War I, soon after he succeeded Russell as leader, 
Rutherford and seven others prominently associated with the society 
were arrested, later tried, and convicted on charges of violating 
the Espionage Act because of their belief of neutrality toward mili¬ 
tary service. After months in the federal penitentiary at Atlanta,

Georgia, they were freed on bail. By May 14, 1919, their erroneous 
convictions were reversed, and on May 5, 1920, they were completely 
exonerated. 
After his release, Rutherford set out to solidify the organization 
through restatement of dogma and person to person evangelism. 
Among other things they received a new instrument for use in their 
preaching work. It was The Golden Age, a journal drawing attention 
to the hope and comfort found in the scriptures. Today it has the 
same purpose under a new name, Awake! 
In 1922, the Bible Students assembled at Cedar Point, Ohio. 
J. F. Rutherford’s discourse on the subject “The Kingdom” was 
especially significant to them. He concluded with the words: “Be¬ 
hold, the King reigns! You are his publicity agents. Therefore adver¬ 
tise, advertise, advertise the King and his Kingdom.” That Kingdom 
has been advertised by Jehovah’s Witnesses ever since. 
During the 1930s and 1940s there were many arrests of Witnesses 
for doing this work, and court cases were fought in the interest of 
preserving freedom of speech, press, assembly, and worship. In the 
United States, appeals from lower courts resulted in the Witnesses’ 
winning 43 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. 
Similarly, favorable judgments have been obtained from high courts 
in other lands. Concerning these court victories, Professor C. S. 
Braden, in his book These Also Believe, said of the Witnesses: “They 
have performed a signal service to democracy by their fight to pre¬ 
serve their civil rights, for in their struggle they have done much 
to secure those rights for every minority group in America.” 
At another convention at Columbus, Ohio, in 1931, the Bible 
Students by resolution embraced the name “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” 
(Isa. 43:10-12) This also signaled the emphasis they put on Jehovah 
as the name of the one indivisible God. 
It had been known and taught by the Bible Students from the 
beginning of Pastor Russell’s ministry that, in addition to those who 
would inherit heavenly life as joint heirs with Christ, mankind in 
general would be restored to perfect life on earth. Rutherford gave 
new insight to this at a convention in Washington, D.C., in 1935. 
Scriptural evidence was produced to prove that the great multitude 
of Revelation 7:9 was identical with the sheep class of Matthew 
25:31-46. 
Rutherford also led in establishing the Watchtower Bible and 
Tract Society of New York, Incorporated which became the major 
publishing house of the Witnesses. Watchtower publications are used 
extensively in the door to door work of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Judge Rutherford died in 1942. Five days later N. H. Knorr (1905- 
77) was unanimously elected president of the Watchtower Society. 
He and his associates promptly embarked upon an extensive educa¬ 
tional work. February 1, 1943, marked the dedication and inaugura¬ 
tion of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. Through the years 
this institution has equipped thousands of ministers for foreign mis¬ 
sionary work. 
In 1943, a new school was also started in the individual congrega¬ 
tions of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It was the Theocratic Ministry School, 
originally open for male enrollment. Enrollees are taught to gather, 
develop, and present Biblical information. 
Of no little significance have been their large gatherings. Among 
these was an International Assembly held in 1958, when 253,922 
Witnesses packed out New York City’s Yankee Stadium and Polo 
Grounds. N. H. Knorr delivered the talk on the subject “God’s King¬ 
dom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?” 
By 1961, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures was 
completed and published in one volume, and this Bible, which was 
offered on a contribution of only one dollar a copy, has had a phe¬ 
nomenal distribution. Since 1950 Jehovah’s Witnesses had been dis¬ 
tributing the Greek Scriptures of the New World Translation and 
individual volumes of the Hebrew Scriptures as they had been com¬ 
pleted. But even before that Jehovah’s Witnesses were urging people 
to read the King James Version, the American Standard Version, 
or any other translation of the Bible, because they say God’s words 
of truth are contained in any Bible. 
N. H. Knorr died in 1977, after many months of illness, and Freder¬ 
ick W. Franz was elected president. Franz had worked in close associ¬ 
ation with N. H. Knorr at the world headquarters of Jehovah’s 
Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York, and his reputation as an eminent 
Bible scholar is well known. 
Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to stress that the world is in the 
last days spoken of in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21 and a 
warning must be given before it is too late. The Witnesses believe 
that the end of this system will occur with the battle of Armageddon. 
(Rev. 16:14,16) They do not predict when it will take place but 
believe it will be soon. In this battle, Jehovah and his son, Jesus, 
will fight and prevail against Satan and his legions. After the great 
destruction of Armageddon the earth will be restored to paradise 
conditions and the great majority of the survivors will dwell on the 
new earth. (Psalms 37:10,11) These are the “other sheep,” whose 
number is limitless. (John 10:16; Rev. 7:9) They were faithful to

Jehovah in this life or chose him after the resurrection. Only a select 
144,000 will actually enjoy the reality of heavenly life with Jesus. 
These will serve as kings and priests with him. (Rev. 20:6) Those 
who refuse to follow Jehovah even after the resurrection judgment 
will be annihilated and forgotten. 
Jehovah’s Witnesses are a highly motivated people dedicated to 
the proliferation of their views. Once baptized, by immersion, each 
Witness is considered a minister and takes no pay for services. They 
meet together in Kingdom Halls, where they study scripture and 
offer mutual encouragement. Witnesses also favor the use of Assem¬ 
blies and Conventions. 
As these interviews indicate Jehovah’s Witnesses came to Appala¬ 
chia during the 1940s and have grown extensively since that time. 
Their theology, sectarian practices, their criticism of organized reli¬ 
gion, and their evangelism have often brought them into conflict 
with mainline Protestants. They again illustrate the pluralism of 
American religion and its impact even on the once isolated religious 
environment of Appalachia. 
METHODISTS 
The Methodist Church seemed made for America. With its gospel 
of free grace and free will, its system of church organization, and 
its heart-warming gospel, Methodism seemed providentially pre¬ 
pared for the democratic, free-wheeling environment of the Ameri¬ 
can frontier. It began not in the coarse exuberance of the camp 
meeting but in the staid cathedrals of Anglicanism. John and Charles 
Wesley were “high church” sons of the Anglican communion, raised 
in an Anglican rectory and educated at Oxford in the rich liturgical 
traditions of Anglican worship. While at Oxford in the early 1700s, 
the Wesleys helped to found the Holy Club, an organization of 
devout students concerned for personal devotion, strict ethics, and 
methodical Bible study. In these small groups the early stages of 
Methodism took shape. 
In 1736, John made his first and only trip to America, traveling 
to the new colony of Georgia to serve as pastor to the settlers and 
missionary to the Indians. He wrote that his chief motive for going 
was to save his own soul. Wesley apparently believed that one might 
be saved better in Georgia, than in England! 
Georgia was a disaster for Wesley. His rigorous pastoral demands 

============================================================

461 
alienated him from almost everyone. The Indians, he soon realized, 
were not waiting with open arms for the white man’s gospel. And 
he fell in love, only to reject and publicly humiliate the woman to 
whom he originally pledged his devotion. Her family threatened a 
lawsuit, and Wesley decided that the Lord was leading him back 
to England. 
In Georgia, however, Wesley made two important discoveries. 
First, as a pastor he developed many of the small group practices 
which later came to characterize Methodism. Second, Wesley en¬ 
countered the Moravians, German pietists whose personal faith, as¬ 
surance of salvation, and sense of divine direction made a profound 
impression upon him. 
On returning to England, Wesley met other Moravians and in 
one of their gatherings at Aldersgate, on May 24, 1738, he experi¬ 
enced a new sense of the Divine Presence on the direction of his 
life. Wesley describes it as that moment “when I felt my heart 
strangely warmed, and I felt I did trust Christ, Christ alone for 
salvation; and an assurance was given me that he had taken away 
my sins, even mine and saved me from the law of sin and death.”2 
Wesley then went forth, preaching the necessity the “new birth,” 
known by faith in Christ. Soon small Methodist societies were formed 
within the Church of England, made up of those who expressed 
sorrow for their sin and a desire “to flee from the wrath to come.” 
These groups worshipped in Anglican churches but met in small 
groups for prayer, Bible study, and mutual exhortation. The gather¬ 
ings were led by lay persons who preached, taught, and ministered 
to the spiritual welfare of the members. With time, the societies 
were organized into two distinct bodies, with separate functions. 
The Band was composed of five to six members of the same sex 
for mutual confession and consolation. The Class included some 
12 members of both sexes for Bible study, prayer, and fellowship. 
This became the basic structure of Methodist organization. 
As opposition developed toward Wesley’s methods, many Angli¬ 
can pulpits were closed to him. Thus, in 1739* beSan another 
innovative practice of early Methodism—field preaching—proclaim¬ 
ing the gospel outdoors in “the highways and byways” of England. 
The Methodist preachers used these outdoor services to reach that 
segment of society often neglected by more formal religion. With 
these enthusiastic and unorthodox procedures, the Methodist socie¬ 
ties soon spread throughout England and were on their way to Amer¬ 
ica. Throughout these years, the Wesleys remained clergymen within 
the Church of England.

FOXFIRE 7 
Methodism in America 
The earliest Methodist society in America was organized in New 
York by Philip Embury. By 1768, the John Street Chapel was founded 
in New York City as the first Methodist Chapel in the new world. 
A year later Wesley sent Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmoor 
as itinerant preachers for America and by 1771, Francis Asbury had 
arrived. Asbury, the “American Wesley,” shaped the life of early 
American Methodism as no other individual. 
With the coming of the American Revolution, the Methodists, 
like the Anglicans, were often associated with the Tory cause. Many 
preachers fled the country and Wesley, himself, condemned the 
American revolt. 
After the war the scene was set for a break with the Church of 
England and the establishment of the Methodist Church. Wesley 
had become convinced that the New Testament taught that presby¬ 
ters (pastors) could ordain new clergy without the presence of a 
bishop. Thus, in 1784, he and Dr. Thomas Coke ordained Richard 
Whatcoat and Henry Vasey as Methodist clergymen for America. 
Wesley then appointed Coke and Francis Asbury as superintendents 
to direct the societies in America. With this act, though Wesley 
himself never officially left the Anglican Church, the Methodist 
Church was born. In December 1784, at the now famous Christmas 
Conference in Baltimore, the Methodist Episcopal Church was for¬ 
mally constituted. 
In the early days after organization Methodists continued to be 
a minority among America denominations. But the theology, the 
system, and the preachers were ready and the frontier was waiting. 
On the American frontier the Methodists thrived and by the mid¬ 
nineteenth century they had become the largest Protestant denomi¬ 
nation in America. Methodist preachers were present at most of 
the camp meetings of the early 1800s and their work soon led to 
the establishment of new southern churches in the Carolinas, Ken¬ 
tucky, and Georgia as well as in the “West,” Ohio, Indiana, and 
Illinois. With time, the camp meeting became almost the exclusive 
domain of Methodist revivalists. 
The revivals shaped the style of Methodist worship incorporating 
Wesley’s concern for the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Sup¬ 
per into the spontaneity, exuberance, and enthusiasm of frontier 
religious experience. Methodist meetings were characterized by loud 
preaching, enthusiastic singing, shouting, and exuberant congrega- 

============================================================

APPENDIX 463 
tional response. Methodist theology, organization, and ministry pro¬ 
vided the impetus for growth in America. 
First, Methodist theology made Arminianism respectable. Method¬ 
ist preachers stressed the possibility of conversion for every person. 
All were “elect” who chose to come to God by repentance and 
faith. 
Once the new birth was secured, the believer could know assurance 
of salvation through the witness of the Holy Spirit. One did not 
merely hope that redemption would take place but experienced it 
as a divine gift. This involved a “witness in the heart,” the power 
to live as Christ lived and the spirit of love for others.3 
Closely linked with the doctrine of assurance was the idea of Chris¬ 
tian perfection, another important and controversial Methodist em¬ 
phasis. Perfection or sanctification, is that process of going on in 
grace, growing more Christlike, and maturing daily in Christian 
. faith. Temptations might come but sin could be avoided. Article 
XI of the United Methodist confession of faith defines sanctification 
as 
The work of God’s grace through the Word and the Spirit, 
by which those who have been born again are cleansed from 
sin in their thoughts, words, and acts, and are enabled to live 
in accordance with God’s will, and to strive for holiness without 
which no one will see the Lord.4 
Perfectionism is related to another controversial Methodist doc¬ 
trine, falling from grace. Individuals who were free to choose Christ 
were also free to reject him, consciously turning away from salvation. 
The Methodists denied the claims of some Baptists regarding faith 
as “once saved, always saved.” Since salvation depended on faithful¬ 
ness, sanctification was essential. 
The concern for human freedom, for the reality of human choice 
in the process of eternal salvation, seemed almost made to order 
for the rugged individualism and democratic idealism of the Ameri¬ 
can frontier. The Methodists grew rapidly on the frontier and the 
success of their doctrines influenced other groups to modify a once 
strict Calvinism in more Arminian directions. 
A second factor in Methodist success was the system around which 
the church was organized. The “connectional system” united local 
churches in regional and national organizations. The primary legisla¬ 
tive body is the General Conference which meets every four years 
and is the national governing body of the church. Delegates, clergy 
and laity, are chosen by local congregations. The present church

FOXFIRE 7 
464 
is also divided into five geographic jurisdictions: North Central, 
Northeastern, Southeastern, South Central, and Western. These sec¬ 
tional conferences also meet every four years to elect bishops and 
appoint members to boards and committees of the church.5 
The yearly Annual Conference is the primary organizational unit 
of Methodism. It is a gathering of clergy and laity from a particular 
region. Here ministers are ordained and appointed, discipline car¬ 
ried out and procedures governing local churches established. 
The Methodist Church has three basic ministerial offices: deacon, 
elder, and bishop. The deacon in Methodism is not usually given 
to the laity but is the first step in the clerical office. Deacons function 
in all ministerial capacities with one exception. The deacon may 
not “administer the sacrament of Holy Communion outside the 
bounds of his/her own charge” (parish).6 Elders hold the basic minis¬ 
terial officers of Methodist churches. They are officially called 
“preachers in charge,” carrying out pastoral tasks in the local congre¬ 
gation. Bishops, the chief administrative officers, are elders who 
have been elected at the Jurisdictional Conference and received con¬ 
secration to their office. They ordain and appoint preachers to local 
churches, and administer the affairs of the conference. 
Within this system all individual churches are related to the one 
church. Autonomy is possible but within the bounds of discipline, 
administration, and procedures set by the various conferences and 
under direction of the bishops. 
A third factor in Methodist growth was the itinerant system, repre¬ 
sented on the frontier by the circuit rider. The small, isolated 
Methodist congregations, unable to secure permanent ministerial 
leadership, were held together by the circuit riders who traveled 
throughout a given area, baptizing, burying, preaching, and estab¬ 
lishing churches. In the mountain regions preachers traveled great 
distances and were often on the circuit for months at a time. In 
their absence, lay leaders conducted Bible studies and prayer meet¬ 
ings, monitoring the day to day spiritual needs of the congregation. 
The itineracy meant that many churches over a wide region could 
receive pastoral care from a relatively small number of preachers. 
As the itinerant system developed, bishops appointed clergy to local 
parishes. Churches have no direct say in who will be their pastor, 
nor are pastors allowed to choose their own charges. Appointments 
are made yearly at the Annual Conference. This system enables 
the church to provide a place of service for every minister, to fill 
every pulpit without extended vacancies or “interims.” This method 
does place considerable pressure on the bishops whose choices and 

============================================================
PAGE 467
============================================================

APPENDIX 
465 
motives do not always go unquestioned by ministers or churches. 
Nonetheless, the Methodist system has proved to be a unique and 
basically efficient practice for administering churches. 
Methodism in the Mountains 
The Methodists thrived in the southern highlands. Circuit riders 
were invaluable in providing ministry for remote mountain churches. 
The connectional system linked the churches, providing a sense 
of unity beyond local congregations. Methodist theology appealed 
to the individualism of the early settlers. 
Two other factors, worship and ecumenicity, illustrate the way 
in which Methodism adapted to the religious context of the moun¬ 
tains. The Methodist Book of Worship served as a guide for the 
churches, particularly in the administration of the sacraments of 
baptism and Lord’s Supper. It gave uniformity and dignity to those 
significant events in the life of the church and the individual. 
The Methodist Hymnal was likewise an important source of theo¬ 
logical instruction. John wrote many hymns, but Charles Wesley 
was the real genius, composing over 4,000 pieces. The Wesleys 
realized that more theology can be taught in one hymn than in a 
multitude of sermons. In one brief couplet, for example, Wesley 
taught the doctrine of free grace: 
For me, for me the Savior died; 
Surely thy grace for all is free. 
I feel it now by faith applied, 
Who died for all hath died for me. 
Wesley’s ritual, hymnody, and heart-warming religion combined 
with the revivalism of the frontier and the folkways of the mountains 
to produce a particular style of mountain Methodism. As the individ¬ 
uals interviewed in this volume recall, Methodists were known for 
their revivalism, shouting, and singing. Dramatic conversions, camp 
meetings, and “brush arbor” revivals were common in Methodist 
gatherings. As these interviews indicate, recent efforts to change 
the style of worship and preaching have not met with enthusiastic 
response from some “old-time” Appalachian Methodists. 
Methodist ecumenism is also evident in the mountains. Wesley 
long emphasized the relationship of all Christians who shared com¬ 
mon faith in Christ. He wrote: “Dost thou love and fear God? It 
is enough! I give thee the right hand of fellowship.”7 Although Meth¬ 
odists did compete with other frontier denominations, debating their 

============================================================
PAGE 468
============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
466 
unique doctrines with Baptists, Presbyterians, or Campbellites, they 
were also known for their cooperation. As the Methodists in these 
interviews testify, Methodists and other denominations frequently 
held revivals and other services together. Where resources and min¬ 
isters were in limited supply, Methodists joined with Baptists and 
others in common worship and ministry. 
At times, Methodist ecumenicity led pastors to provide alternative 
modes of baptism beyond the normal practice of sprinkling. In fact, 
many Appalachian Methodist churches administered baptism by im¬ 
mersion as frequently as they did by sprinkling. 
Divisions Among the Methodists 
Although the Methodists did not divide as frequently as the Bap¬ 
tists, they naturally experienced schisms over social and theological 
issues. The original organization, The Methodist Episcopal Church, 
has experienced numerous divisions and reunifications. Divided in 
1845 over slavery and abolition, the Methodist Episcopal Churches, 
North and South, were reunited in 1939, along with the Methodist 
Protestant Church, another antislavery denomination. In 1968, the 
Methodist Episcopal Church was joined with the Evangelical United 
Brethren to form the United Methodist Church. It remains the larg¬ 
est Methodist body in the United States. 
The Congregational Methodist Church was formed in 1852 in a 
separation from the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, due to dif¬ 
ferences over the Methodist system of bishops and itinerant minis¬ 
ters. In these churches, pastors are called by local congregations, 
not appointed by bishops. They stress local autonomy and associa- 
tional fellowship instead of episcopal administration. 
The Wesleyan Methodist Church of America began in 1843 in a 
dispute over episcopacy and slavery. This body places stress on 
holiness and offers strong opposition to alcohol, tobacco, and per¬ 
sonal immorality. 
The Free Methodist Church of North America, founded in i860, 
represents a highly conservative branch of Methodism. Members 
claim to represent true Methodist original Methodist teaching, stress¬ 
ing personal conversion, conservative theology, and the experience 
of sanctification for all believers. Free Methodists have strong roots 
in Appalachia, particularly through Asbury Theological Seminary, 
in Wilmore, Kentucky. 
There are many other Methodist groups less relevant to this partic¬ 
ular study. Significant among these other denominations are the 

============================================================

============================================================

APPENDIX 467 
Black Methodist bodies such as the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Zion. 
Methodism made a unique contribution to American, and Appala¬ 
chian religion. Its concern for hearty religion and evangelism, its 
stress on education and organization were united in a response to 
the free spirit of American democracy. The Methodists made a signif¬ 
icant impact on American religious life. 
PENTECOSTALS 
Perhaps no other group of Appalachian Christians has been more 
misunderstood, caricatured, and maligned than the people of the 
Holiness/Pentecostal tradition. For many they are the “holy rollers” 
whose religion is equated with superstition, ignorance, and rabid 
emotionalism. They are sometimes confused with snake handlers, 
their leaders labeled as charlatans, and their worship services the 
object of ridicule. They are much misunderstood and sometimes 
abused for their faith. 
Perhaps the Pentecostals represent the ultimate expression of the 
Reformation concept of the priesthood of the believer. In their view, 
the individual can become a vehicle of divine inspiration and the 
mouthpiece of the divine word. Through the medium of the believer 
the Holy Spirit speaks anew in tongues known and unknown. Theirs 
is sometimes an extreme subjectivism in which the individual alone 
stands before God and speaks to him in a language which only 
God can know. They are a people confident that the Word of God 
is true because they have spoken it for themselves. Pentecostals 
offer themselves as living proof that Jesus Christ is alive and well 
and living in their hearts. They provide an important response to 
the questing of where one goes following Christian conversion. 
The Holiness Movement: 
Sanctification and Perfection 
In the Holiness movement of the nineteenth century, Christians 
sought to answer the questions of what to do after Jesus comes 
into your heart. The Methodists had made this an important doctrine 
in their early days, but by the late 1800s many had become disen¬ 
chanted with what they felt to be a decline in Methodist zeal for 
holiness. Many of these persons had been converted in camp meet- 

============================================================

FOXFIRE 7 
468 
ings or urban revival campaigns and were frustrated with the spiritual 
infirmity they often experienced after the initial enthusiasm of con¬ 
version had passed. Advocates of Holiness ideology suggested that 
just as a person was justified by faith in a critical encounter with 
God, so the new believer must be sanctified, baptized with the Holy 
Spirit, in a second dramatic event. This experience empowered the 
convert to live the Christian life, to combat temptation and enjoy 
the fruits of the Spirit. 
Holiness groups appeared in many American denominations, par¬ 
ticularly among the Methodists, in the late nineteenth century. These 
societies did not immediately separate from the parent bodies, but 
met outside organized services for mutual encouragement and dis¬ 
cussion of holiness. In time, however, as mainline denominations 
reacted negatively toward Holiness doctrines and as members them¬ 
selves disagreed over such questions as when sanctification occurred 
and what were its signs, new Holiness denominations were founded. 
Perhaps the best known such group was the Church of the Nazarene 
founded by Phineas Brezee in 1908. They held to the following 
doctrines: 
1. Personal morality 
2. Conservative theologically and politically 
3. Local church autonomy 
4. Concern for personal conversion and evangelism 
5. Holiness and Spirit baptism emphasized but the process less 
clearly defined or formalized1 
The Holiness churches, therefore, believed that sanctification was 
an experience which occurred after conversion, empowering the 
Christian in holiness of life and service for Christ in the world. 
The terms of this experience varied from believer to believer and 
group to group. Pentecostalism represents the development of a 
definite process whereby the “second baptism” was known and se¬ 
cured. 
Pentecostalism: 
The Early Stages 
Pentecostals trace their modem beginnings to the life and work 
of Charles Fox Parham in 1901. Parham, long interested in Divine 
healing and prayer for the sick, founded the “College of Bethel” 
in Topeka, Kansas, in 1900, for the purpose of teaching the Bible 
with particular attention to the Holy Ghost and healing. To this 

============================================================

469 
small “school” came Agnes N. Ozman, an impressionable person 
in delicate health. It was Ozman who, in December 1900, under 
Parham’s guidance, experienced the gift of the Spirit as evidenced 
by speaking in tongues. Parham and Miss Ozman insisted that she 
spoke for days in the Chinese language. 
Pentecostals believe that this was the reenactment of the day of 
Pentecost as described in the book of Acts. It represents the begin¬ 
ning of the “latter rain” of the Holy Spirit upon the church prepara¬ 
tory to the second coming of Jesus Christ. 
Parham and his followers traveled throughout Kansas and the 
Midwest, spreading the word of these experiences. The faith of the 
apostles had been rediscovered and the Apostolic Faith Movement 
was on its way. It was left only for a disciple of Parham, W. J. Sey¬ 
mour, to bring the movement to Los Angeles and the Azusa Street 
Mission, a name which became synonymous with Pentecostal origins. 
- In this mission church in an impoverished neighborhood, a revival 
broke out with an emphasis on Spirit baptism, healing, and spiritual 
gifts. Hundreds of people came through the mission and helped 
spread the enthusiasm throughout the country. Periodicals telling 
of miraculous occurrences were published and small Pentecostal 
congregations were organized.2 
Pentecostal ideas also spread through the work of a number of 
revivalists who traveled from coast to coast preaching in tents, out¬ 
door rallies, and store front churches. They were the charismatic 
personalities, healers, radio preachers, and celebrities of the fledg¬ 
ling movement. With the exception of Oral Roberts and Kathryn 
Kuhlman, perhaps the most famous of the Pentecostal preachers, 
these evangelists were almost unknown outside the Pentecostal sub¬ 
culture. Within that community, however, they were the apostolic 
spokespersons of the latter days. Their crusades were attended by 
multitudes and were for Pentecostals, the scene of miraculous heal¬ 
ings, dramatic conversions, and enthusiastic response. These preach¬ 
ers often had little formal education or seminary training. They 
were sometimes self-ordained following a momentous conversion, 
Spirit baptism, and “call” to preach. They were controversial and 
sometimes abrasive, condemned by the secular press and mainline 
churches as charlatans and outright crooks. Their methods were 
sensational and they frequently would tolerate no opposition to their 
divinely ordained task. 
Their names are today a roll call of early Pentecostal “saints.”

end to one of the most famous women Pentecostal leaders. 
These are but a few of the more prominent figures of the move¬ 
ment. Pentecostalism, as perhaps no other American denomination, 
has known a multitude of local and regional evangelists who traveled 
their own circuits of small towns and mountain churches often offer¬ 
ing the same fare as Roberts or Kuhlman to the people in the backwa¬ 
ter places of America. But big time or small time Pentecostalism 
flourished in what some have called “the healing and charismatic 
revivals” of the twentieth century.3 
Pentecostal Beliefs: 
Orthodox, Controversy, and Schism 
It is difficult to generalize about the beliefs of the Pentecostals. 
Small sects and large denominations with Pentecostal emphasis vary 
in specific doctrines and minute definitions of dogma. In a recent 
history of the movement, Robert M. Anderson identifies the beliefs 
generally held by most Pentecostal bodies. They are summarized 
here with some additions. Generalizations of otherwise intricate doc¬ 
trines are inevitable. 
First, it is important to note that on most traditional dogmas of 
the church—trinity, creation, virgin birth, atonement, resurrection— 
Pentecostals are for the most part in agreement with other Protestant 
denominations. There are exceptions, but most could affirm a certain 
evangelical orthodoxy similar to that of certain fundamentalist or 
conservative churches. Their orthodoxy often becomes questionable 
to non-Pentecostals due to some of their methods of worship and 
ministry as well as their perspective on the two characteristically 
Pentecostal doctrines, healing and speaking in tongues. 
Second, students of Pentecostalism have underestimated the sig¬ 
nificance of another controversial Christian doctrine, eschatology, 
on the theology of the Pentecostals. Eschatology (the doctrine of 
last things) is a foundation for other doctrines in the church. The

world, most Pentecostals believe, is living in the “last days.” Al¬ 
though these ideas are not limited to Pentecostal churches, they 
have played an important part of the Holiness/Pentecostal move¬ 
ments and are a popular topic of the preachers. 
Although there are numerous theories regarding the second com¬ 
ing, Pentecostals tend to favor what is known as a premillennial 
view of the second coming. Premillennialists insist that Jesus will 
return to earth to rescue (rapture) his church prior to the “great 
tribulation” of the world and the establishment of Christ’s kingdom 
for a thousand years (millennium). Before the millennium, Christ 
will return, raise the dead in Christ and those who are alive will 
“meet Christ in the air.” After this a time of tribulation occurs in 
the world from which the saints are spared. Christ then returns to 
earth and the millennial kingdom of peace and joy is founded.4 
Many Pentecostals also hold to a dispensational premillennialism. 
, This view which was popularized in England by J. N. Darby in 1903, 
and America by Cyrus Scofield in 1909, was an important doctrine 
for explaining the gifts of healing as experienced by Pentecostals. 
It suggests that time is divided into seven dispensations, whereby 
the terms for salvation (different in each dispensation) are made 
known. The world is on the edge of the seventh and final millennium- 
ists culminating in Christ’s return. 
The outpourings of healing and tongues were evidence of that 
“latter rain” which God’s people would experience prior to Christ’s 
return. They were predicted by the prophet Joel who wrote: “And 
it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon 
all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your 
old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.” 
(Joel 2:28) 
Tongues and healings then are not merely exercises of spiritual 
life for the enjoyment of the faithful. They are signposts along the 
way to the end of the age and the beginning of the true spiritual 
kingdom. 
A third distinctive in Pentecostal thought is the gift of tongues, 
or glossolalia. It is the “ecstatic utterance” discussed by Paul in I 
Corinthians 12:10,28. The experience of tongues, Pentecostals be¬ 
lieve, is the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. It is a spiritual 
gift to the church and a sign that God is preparing to reenact Pente¬ 
cost before the second coming. 
The gift of tongues may be for the edification of the individual 
believer or as a word from God to the church. In the latter case 
another person present will usually serve as interpreter. 

============================================================

The experience of tongues—as other languages or as ecstatic ut¬ 
terances—is mentioned in the New Testament, Acts 2:1-13 and in 
certain writings of St. Paul. It has occurred in earlier periods of 
Christian history among various sectarian groups. Only since 1900 
has it produced such a major impact on so many segments of the 
Christian community. Whether or not it is required of all Christians 
is a matter of debate among Pentecostals and non-Pentecostals alike. 
Even more controversial than the question of glossolalia is that 
of healing. It has been the source of severe criticism for Pentecostals, 
the message of both the sincere and the charlatan “faith healers,” 
and the cause of great speculation among the faithful across many 
denominations. 
In the recovery of Pentecost, many believe that the apostolic gifts 
of healing were also restored to the church. Scripture was filled 
with promises regarding healing and accounts of miracles performed 
by both Jesus and the disciples. With the renewal of Pentecostal 
power could not those deeds be repeated with good measure? 
In some Pentecostal churches the prayer of the faithful was offered 
in behalf of the community by the elders of the church. In keeping 
with James 5:14-15 they anointed the sick with oil and prayed for 
healing. Others claimed to have received unique gifts of healing 
to be shared with the church. These were the faith healers, some 
functioning in local congregations, others traveling across the coun¬ 
try holding sensational meetings where the masses could receive 
the touch and the prayer of healing. 
For many the gift of healing came through special signs and experi¬ 
ences. William Branham and Oral Roberts both claimed to have 
received a warm sensation in one hand which served as the contact 
point between human suffering and Divine healing. Others, like 
Kathryn Kuhlman were able to sense, rather than touch, those who 
were to receive healing. Still others made promises to persons on 
the edge of hopelessness. 
As noted in these accounts, the reports of miracles continue along 
with accompanying debates. Nonetheless, Pentecostal theology 
stresses possibility, indeed, the reality of healing as part of the latter- 
rain of the Spirit. 
A fifth aspect of Pentecostal belief is found in their view of worship. 
Here the unique quality of Pentecostal life, particularly in the moun¬ 
tains, becomes evident. There is diversity, from “ordered spontane¬ 
ity,” where even the experience of tongues has its proper place, 
to the absolute abandon of simultaneous dancing, preaching, heal¬ 
ing, and singing. 
Pentecostals brought drums, electric guitars, and other “worldly”

instruments into their churches long before the 1960s made such 
instruments vogue in more sophisticated churches. Their music is 
frequently loud and its words almost inaudible to those not familiar 
with it. In some mountain churches, music provides a background 
for the frenzied sermons, the shouts, and the glossolalia which may 
occur at any time. The Spirit is to have complete control so the 
services often go where Spirit seems to go and end when Spirit 
seems to have completed its work. Preachers pace the platform call¬ 
ing for congregational response, stopping while others speak in 
tongues, or leading persons to be “slain in the Spirit,” knocked 
to the ground as a sign of the power of God. 
Worship is personal and highly subjective among Pentecostals. 
Few participants would feel that worship occurs unless the individual 
is dramatically touched by the Spirit of God. Personal experience 
of the divine Spirit is of great importance. Believers claim to have 
experienced visions, voices, and other manifestations of the miracu¬ 
lous. They seek to cast out demons, stress the need for personal 
conversion, and desire that every Christian receive Spirit baptism. 
While they observe baptism (usually by immersion) and the Lord’s 
Supper (a memorial), they appear to be less concerned for these 
outer forms of spiritual expression than for the inner reality of spiri¬ 
tual experience. 
Finally, by way of summary, Pentecostals have traditionally main¬ 
tained a strict personal morality, conducting crusades against world¬ 
liness and immorality. They generally oppose dancing, tobacco, 
liquor, cards, gambling, and other personal practices which they 
deem unbecoming to the Christian. Many Pentecostals have affirmed 
their moral uniqueness by dressing in accordance with certain bibli¬ 
cal admonitions. Women are particularly obvious. They often wear 
no makeup, refuse to cut their hair, and wear dresses with a specified 
length and style. 
Pentecostals seek to recreate the primitive Christian community 
by exercising their gifts, preaching the “old-time” gospel and living 
separate from the world. Their doctrines are guides whereby the 
emotionalism and subjective religious experience of Pentecostal reli¬ 
gion may be cultivated. 
Pentecostal Groups 
Like the Baptists, congregational autonomy means that many Pen¬ 
tecostal churches are completely independent of any denominational 
affiliation. Many take denominational names but have little or nomi¬ 
nal connection with the parent body. These local churches abound

in the mountains. Others have some relationship to some of the 
mainline Pentecostal denominations in America. The churches de¬ 
scribed here are primarily those mentioned in the interviews. 
The Assemblies of God, General Council is the largest Pentecostal de¬ 
nomination, founded in 1914 from a union of several small Pentecos¬ 
tal groups. While they maintain a strong local autonomy, each of 
the forty-six districts have presbyteries (gatherings of ministers) 
which oversee ordination of pastors. The General Conference, made 
up of clerical and lay representatives, determines doctrines and mis¬ 
sionary policies. 
The Fire-Baptized Holiness Association was formally organized in An¬ 
derson, South Carolina, in 1898, following a series of revival services 
where tongues and other enthusiastic outbursts took place. These 
Pentecostals emphasized Wesleyan sanctification and proposed a 
third experience of grace beyond conversion and baptism of the 
Spirit. This was a “Baptism of Fire,” which empowered the believer 
with the life of the Spirit.5 The churches are organized around a 
Methodist system of episcopal government. They are evangelistic 
and their services emotional, accented by ecstatic experiences. 
Some two hundred different bodies claim the title, Church of 
God. Some are Pentecostal; others are not. 
One of the more prominent is the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennes¬ 
see), which was organized in 1886, but accepted its Pentecostal views 
in 1908. The church has experienced numerous divisions and names. 
Doctrines stress justification by faith, baptism by the Holy Ghost, 
healing, and Arminian theology. Churches maintain a strong moral 
code, repudiating the use of tobacco, alcohol, and jewelry. They 
practice baptism by immersion, the Lord’s Supper, and foot 
washing.6 
The original Church of God, Inc., split from the other Cleveland 
group in 1917, insisting that it represents the true teaching of the 
Church of God as formed in 1886. They reject creeds as unbiblical, 
preach faith, sanctification, and tongues and their churches empha¬ 
size local autonomy. 
The Pentecostal Holiness Church is a union of a group of the Fire- 
Baptized Holiness Church and the Pentecostal Holiness Church, 
formed in 1911. They maintain a Methodist polity with bishops and 
yearly conferences. Theologically, the church preaches justification 
and sanctification as distinct works of grace along with a third experi¬ 
ence, Spirit baptism, evidenced in speaking in tongues.

PRESBYTERIANS 
With the Presbyterians most of the caricatures of mountain reli¬ 
gion fall apart. They do not speak in tongues, nor handle snakes; 
their worship is ordered, their preachers are usually well educated, 
and their churches well organized. Yet the Presbyterians brought 
revivalism to the American frontier and were among the first to 
plant the Christian faith in Appalachia. They remain in the mountains 
today, not as loud as some groups or as influential as others. Perhaps 
they are, as one writer describes them, “God’s minority.’’1 
John Calvin: 
Father and Theologian 
It is to John Calvin, the reformer of Geneva, that Presbyterians 
trace their beginnings. Although modified in other times and circum¬ 
stances, Calvin’s thought has shaped the directions of Presbyterian 
theology up to the present day. 
Born in 1509 in France, Calvin intended to become a lawyer until 
conversion turned him to the embattled Protestantism of the six¬ 
teenth century. By the age of twenty-seven Calvin had written the 
first edition of The Institutes of the Christian Religion, a work which 
became one of the most important and formative documents in 
Christian history. Its systematic approach to Christian doctrine, and 
its insights into the nature of the church has made it the primary 
theological text book of Reformation ideas. 
Calvin’s views as set forth in the Institutes were applied to the 
church in Geneva where he began work in 1536. After struggles 
with himself and with the city fathers and after an angry exile of 
some three years, Calvin succeeded in establishing the city as the 
model of Reformed theology and piety. “The most perfect school 
of Christ” since the time of the apostles, said the obviously biased 
Scottish Presbyterian, John Knox. Nonetheless, the principles of 
early Presbyterian church life were set forth and exemplified in Ge¬ 
neva. 
With Geneva as a base, Calvinism spread throughout Europe and 
soon became the most influential of the Reformation movements. 
Ifj France, the Huguenots (French Calvinists) flourished, challenging 
the Catholic establishment for domination of the French court. The 
infamous St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, August 24, 1572, saw 
thousands of French Protestants die at the hands of French troops. 
Although toleration was finally established in 1598 by the once Prot-

estant king, Henry of Navarre, the Huguenots never regained 
strength in France. 
In Scotland, the work and personality of John Knox made Calvin¬ 
ism a major religious force in a Catholic land. After centuries of 
debates and battles against Catholics and Episcopalians, the Pres¬ 
byterian Church was secured in Scotland. By 1929, the major Pres¬ 
byterian bodies had united into the Church of Scotland, the largest 
Presbyterian communion in Britain.2 
Presbyterianism in England has exhibited a colorful and stormy 
history. In England the Calvinist position was represented in those 
“Puritans” who sought to reform the Anglican Church in more 
Protestant directions. Although they were divided over the type of 
church government—Episcopal, Congregational, Presbyterian—and 
whether or not Anglicanism could indeed be “purified,” the Puritans 
were the theological heirs of John Calvin in England. After years 
of confrontation with the English crown, the Anglican establishment 
and a resulting civil war, the British Presbyterians gained a momen¬ 
tary victory of the Westminster Assembly of 1643. There they pro¬ 
duced the Westminster Confession and related documents which 
became the guiding doctrinal statements for Presbyterians to this 
day. Although they did not succeed in maintaining Presbyterianism 
as the official religion of England, the Westminster divines provided 
a system of doctrine which was carried throughout the world, most 
significantly perhaps to America. 
Presbyterians in America 
The persecution of Calvinists and other dissenters in England, 
Scotland, and Ireland under the Stuart monarchs and their Anglican 
allies brought many Presbyterians to the new world. They were a 
minority in New England where Puritan Congregationalism was the 
official religion. Presbyterians also settled in Virginia and Maryland 
by the mid-1600s and found their earliest substantial strength in 
the South “in the ‘back country’ of the Piedmont and in the Valley 
of Virginia.”3 
These scattered Presbyterian churches discovered their first organ¬ 
izational leader in Francis Makemie who in 1706 founded the first 
American Presbytery, in Maryland. Thus, the official structures of 
the Presbyterian system were established and other Presbyterian 
organizations soon followed throughout the colonies. 
It was in the revivals of the first Great Awakening that Presbyteri¬ 
ans began to increase their numbers and extend their influence in 
American religious life. Revivalistic Presbyterian preachers brought

enthusiasm to the pulpits, converts to the altar, and schism to the 
church. Such revivalists as William Tennent and his son Gilbert 
drew sharp distinctions between the preachers of evangelical con¬ 
version and the ministers who continued to cling to the more tradi¬ 
tional methods of nurture and creedal formulas. As the Great Awak¬ 
ening swept the colonies, Presbyterians and others divided over 
revivalistic methods and results. In 1741, the traditionalists broke 
with the revivalists, dividing Presbyterians, into New Side (pro¬ 
revival) and Old Side (anti-revival) forces. They were reunited in 
1758 in a compromise move. 
With the American Revolution and independence, Presbyterians 
were a leading force in the religious life of the new nation. They 
were prepared to take the gospel to the wilds, to bring civilization 
and Christianity to the developing frontier. Presbyterian preachers 
were among the first to invade the frontier areas of the Carolinas 
and Kentucky, helping to produce a new wave of Awakenings which 
sent Presbyterians deeper into the South and West. 
By 1800, Presbyterian preachers, like James McCready and Barton 
W. Stone, aided the growth of camp meeting revivals which spread 
throughout the backwoods. From their base in Kentucky they orga¬ 
nized meetings in which thousands were converted and from which 
new churches and denominations were founded. 
Stone called the now famous Cane Ridge meeting in August 1801, 
the largest such meeting of the period with attendance of ten to 
twenty thousand people. Soon division had again occurred over re¬ 
vival methods, the ordaining of untrained clergy, and the doctrine 
of predestination. As a result of these controversies, the Cumberland 
Presbyterian Church was founded in 1810. 
Although the Presbyterians spread throughout the South and the 
rest of the nation, divisions over polity, revivals, education, slavery, 
and the Civil War, split the church into several different bodies. 
They are listed and described here by way of summary: 
Old School: Traditional, concerned over a Congregationalist; en¬ 
croachments; seeking to preserve Calvinism without 
revivalistic innovations. 
New School: Cooperating closely with Congregationalists; revival¬ 
istic in practice and theology. 
These divisions occurred in 1837, with both sides retaining the 
same name, the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. 
With the Civil War, there was further division, North and South, 
in 1861.

By 1864 the southern churches had united to form the Presbyterian 
Church of the Confederate States of America. Following the war 
this Southern Presbyterian Church became the Presbyterian Church 
in the United States. It exists today and exercises the greatest influ¬ 
ence among Presbyterians in the Appalachians. Its northern counter¬ 
part, the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, 
represents the other major Presbyterian denomination in contempo¬ 
rary America. That church has also sent pastors, missionaries, and 
teachers into Appalachia.4 
Presbyterians in Appalachia 
The Presbyterians in the mountains defy many of the stereotypes 
often associated with Appalachian religion. Their services are more 
orderly, their ministers more educated, their church life more uni¬ 
form and perhaps less independent than that of other mountain 
religious groups. Much of the Presbyterian influence has come less 
from the revivals they have held (though they do hold revivals) than 
by the educational institutions they have founded. Indeed, the Pres¬ 
byterians were among the earliest educators to establish schools 
in the mountains. These schools were founded to provide basic 
education and spiritual instruction, as well as practical, vocational 
training. Efforts were made to found schools where both men and 
women could receive balanced education. Schools for boys and for 
girls were organized in West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, 
and Tennessee.5 
The founders of these schools were not as concerned to turn 
students toward Presbyterian theology as toward basic educational 
and moral values. That approach, along with the more structured, 
less aggressively evangelistic methods of Presbyterian churches, has 
meant that they are a minority denomination in the mountains. 
Presbyterian Belief and Practice 
The interviews in this section, particularly those of the Reverends 
Clyde Hicks and L. B. Gibbs, provide excellent descriptions of Pres¬ 
byterian faith and practice as developed in Appalachia. Their com¬ 
ments need only to be placed within a broader historical context. 

============================================================
PAGE 481

APPENDIX 
479 
They illustrate the way in which Presbyterian churches have retained 
a unique historical identity while being shaped by the social and 
religious setting of the mountains. 
First, Presbyterians maintain a strong sense of worship and church 
order. In Calvin’s view the church is found where the Word of God 
is preached, the sacraments (baptism and Lord’s Supper) observed, 
and discipline maintained. The sense of order began with the sover¬ 
eignty of God and its place in human events. 
The idea of Providence, a benevolent spirit guiding the affairs 
of human beings and the directions of the universe, was the founda¬ 
tion of Calvinistic thought. For Calvin, the world is not governed 
by a purposeless caprice or fate. The divine will is ultimately su¬ 
preme. 
Presbyterian worship is as simple as it is dignified, ordered, and 
stately. Early Presbyterians, for example, refused to sing “manmade” 
hymns, favoring only the words of the Psalms set to music. The 
sermon was the central event of worship and the Word of God 
informed the entire worship experience. 
Order characterized ecclesiastical organization as Presbyterians 
put Calvin’s concepts of church government into practice. In early 
Presbyterianism leadership was vested in four officers. 
Pastors preached the word of God and saw to the spiritual needs 
of the congregation. 
Teachers instructed the church in scripture and doctrine attending 
to the instruction of the young in the faith. 
Deacons cared for the physical needs of the church, the needy. 
They were responsible for providing food, clothing, and other mate¬ 
rial goods to the poor, the sick, and the needy. 
Elders were the only non-ordained officers. They were responsible 
for the administration of church affairs. 
The sense of order also influenced Presbyterian concern for 
an educated, well-trained ministry. Presbyterians historically have 
placed great emphasis on the fulfillment of strenuous educational 
requirements prior to the granting of ordination. These require¬ 
ments often led to divisions within the church as revivalism brought 
new and untrained converts who sensed an immediate call to preach. 
In the Presbyterian system individual congregations are closely 
related. Sessions represent the governing board of the local church 
and are made up of clergy and elected laity. Presbyteries are gather-

ings of clergy and laity from various churches to decide in matters 
of church government, programs, and cooperation. 
With their sense of order, their concern for ministerial training, 
and their more structured connectionalism, Presbyterians often 
lacked the spontaneity, autonomy, and individualism so characteris¬ 
tic of mountain religion. Nonetheless, as these materials indicate, 
Presbyterian churches in the mountains were greatly influenced by 
their setting. Many Presbyterian churches were strongly concerned 
for revivalism and evangelical conversion. As already noted, Pres¬ 
byterians helped to bring revivalistic Christianity onto the American 
frontier. Unlike such hyper-Calvinist groups as the Primitive Bap¬ 
tists, who rejected evangelistic preaching, Presbyterians preached 
the necessity for personal repentance and conversion, believing by 
the “foolishness of preaching” God has chosen to awaken the elect. 
Thus, Presbyterians have produced generations of outstanding evan¬ 
gelical preachers. 
On the other hand, Presbyterian concern for nurture and growth 
in grace influence many members toward a more gradual process 
of conversion. These “once-born” Christians reflect the Presbyterian 
view of baptism and Christian nurture. Infants are baptized under 
the covenant of grace and then instructed through the church until 
the once promised faith is internalized. This personal faith may de¬ 
velop gradually or dramatically, but its source is God discovered 
through the witness of the nurturing community, the church. 
These studies also reveal that mountain Presbyterians have been 
influenced by the Pentecostal/Charismatic tradition in the use of 
tongues and the anointing with oil. Among some Appalachian Pres¬ 
byterians, there is also a tendency toward more spontaneity and 
informality in worship. 
Controversy has plagued the two major Presbyterian bodies in 
America during the last two decades. Efforts to respond to the civil 
rights upheavals and the Vietnam war of the 1960s produced strong 
divisions within the bodies. Revisions in the Confession of Faith 
approved in 1967 provoked debates between conservatives, moder¬ 
ates, and liberals. Like other of the “mainline” American denomina¬ 
tions during this period, Presbyterians have experienced some 
decline in membership and a new quest for identity. The churches 
of Appalachia, somewhat insulated from these changes, have none¬ 
theless been affected by modern trends, divisions, and controversies.

SNAKE HANDLERS 
“Snake Handler.” . . . Perhaps no other term so colors the popu¬ 
lar image of Appalachian religion. For many outsiders, the primary 
religious expression of the southern highlands is found in the people 
who “take up serpents.” 
Truth is that snake handlers represent a small minority in the 
mountains though they are more prevalent there than anywhere 
else. Their bizarre practices, their legal battles, and the extensive 
attention they have received from the media, contribute to the my¬ 
thology surrounding their beliefs and accompanying observances. 
The snake handlers represent a sectarian expression of the Pente¬ 
costal/Holiness tradition. Theologically they affirm a basic fun¬ 
damentalism particularly evident in the biblical literalism of their 
snake-handling, fire-holding, poison-drinking observances. They 
insist on a dramatic conversion experience for each individual fol¬ 
lowed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the accompanying 
signs of tongues and healing. 
Members are urged to observe a strict moral code which condemns 
gambling, alcohol, tobacco, illicit sex, movies, dancing, and other 
worldly amusements. Jewelry, “bobbed hair,” and expensive clothes 
are forbidden to women. 
In many respects their services are little different from those of 
the mountain Pentecostals with shouting, tongues speaking, prayers 
for healing, loud preaching, frenzied movement, and emotional en¬ 
thusiasm, all carried out to the beat of drums and the rhythm of 
electric guitars. 
But the distinctiveness of the snake handlers is a real one. They 
take up serpents—poisonous rattlers, copperheads, and water moc¬ 
casins—and therein is their biblical literalism most evident. The 
snake handlers read the verses located in the final portion of the 
Gospel of Mark and insist that those words must be taken literally. 
Indeed they declare that if those prophecies are not true, none of 
the Bible is true. If they cannot be taken literally and fulfilled, then 
no other doctrines, particularly those related to salvation, can be 
trustworthy. The verses state: 
and these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name 
shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 
They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, 
it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and 
they shall recover. 
—Mark 16:17-18, KJV

Most people called snake handlers do it all—take up serpents, 
put fire to their bodies, drink doses of poison. “We must do it,” 
they declare “or else Jesus is a liar.” “If we don’t do it, God will 
raise up a people who will do it.”1 
Modern biblical scholars point out that this ending does not exist 
in the earliest manuscripts of the New Testament; that it was appar¬ 
ently an addendum placed there by later scribes as a testimony to 
the power of the apostolic church. But that is of little consequence 
to the people who take up serpents. Their King James Version of 
the Bible contains the passage and it is the very Word of God. 
The fact that some “liberals” would question its validity is further 
evidence of its truth and the apostasy of the modem day church. 
The people who take up serpents are sincere and fervent in their 
conviction that they must do “their thing” if the scripture is to be 
proved true. Failure is to violate God’s Word and deny his power. 
It began in 1909, when a Tennessean, George W. Hensley, came 
preaching the need to follow the practices of Mark 16. Hensley 
traveled to several Pentecostal churches preaching his doctrines and 
handling snakes. Small groups accepted his views and gathered to 
worship, speaking in tongues, praying for healing, and taking up 
serpents. After some ten years, Hensley moved near Harlan, Ken¬ 
tucky, where his beliefs were accepted by members of a local Church 
of God. By the thirties and forties the movement had spread through¬ 
out the Appalachian region. Some participants had died from snake 
bites or from drinking poison. Court cases against the group became 
common and, in their minds, a general period of persecution 
resulted.2 For the most part the churches are small, rural congrega¬ 
tions, many in remote or semi-remote places. More recent devotees 
have sought remote areas to escape the long arm of the law and 
the fascinated gaze of the curious. The churches are composed 
largely of persons who see themselves as followers of the simple 
but demanding way of Christ which requires them to place ultimate 
trust in God. Most repudiate the idea that they act out of sensational¬ 
ism or from their own abilities. They argue that no one is to take 
up serpents who does not receive the “gift” to do so, an overpower¬ 
ing urge to respond to the urgings of the Spirit. The handling of 
snakes, like speaking in tongues, is a manifestation of Spirit posses¬ 
sion. Most testify to a fear of the snakes until the unction to touch 
them is given by God. 
They do not perform such acts during a specific time in the service 
but when other activities—singing, shouting, shaking, or speaking

or tail, drape multiple snakes across their bodies or hold several 
in each hand at once. 
Others simultaneously may hold hands and faces over torches 
or drink doses of poison. All insist that such religious experiences 
are dynamic and inexplicable. They insist that snakes are not 
“milked,” fangs removed or poison diluted. The sight of a crowd 
of people gyrating, shouting, singing, with tongues blaring and 
snakes everywhere is a strange and terrifying experience. But the 
participants are assured that it is a powerful demonstration of the 
Spirit. 
The people who take up serpents are decent, loving people who 
take care of their own. Both men and women “greet one another 
with a holy kiss” (Romans 16:16), and the uniqueness of their wor¬ 
ship, the threat of persecution, and the victory over the serpent bind 
them together in a strong fellowship. In conquering the serpent 
they show their contempt for the forces of evil which it has long 
represented. The “gift” to take up serpents is but one of many 
signs of divine power available to the true believer. 
Multiple explanations—psychological, sociological, religious, and 
economic—are frequently suggested. Some see it as a tangible way 
of proving God and verifying faith. Others see it as a social phenome¬ 
non or propose a mass hypnotism for snake and handler alike. 
Suffice it to say that the snake handlers are good, hardworking 
folks who expect more from religion than many mainline Protestants. 
They have a worship format in which all may choose to participate, 
holding snakes, speaking in tongues, praying, shouting, and which 
is freewheeling and spontaneous. Snakes are not held in every ser¬ 
vice, and not in every season. 
The relative isolation of the mountains as well as the educational 
deficiencies have had a decided effect on the growth of snake han¬ 
dling in Appalachia. Their legal battles raise serious questions about 
the states’ ability to define religion and the growth of American 
pluralism. Court cases are usually ended in rulings against the church 
but the martyr complex impells them on, even when breaking laws. 
Snake handlers are not a popular group in the mountains. The 
Pentecostals seek to escape identification with them; the mainline 
Protestants look down upon them and the courts seek to inhibit 
their free exercise of religion. They are a strange phenomenon of 
the religion of Appalachia, a religion fast becoming an expression 
of the ultimate in literalism and fundamentalist dogma.

GLOSSARY 
Altar Call: A public invitation to Christian conversion usually made 
at the end of a worship service. Sinners are invited to the altar or 
the front of the church for prayer, counseling and public profession 
of Christian faith. 
Amillennialist: An interpretation of Christian eschatology which 
views the millennium as symbolic, having only spiritual, not literal, 
fulfillment. See Rev. 20:1-7. 
Anointing with Oil: An observance associated with healing, practiced 
by many Protestant churches, particularly in the Episcopal and Pente¬ 
costal traditions. See James 5:14-15. 
Baptism of the Holy Ghost (Spirit): A special outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit after initial conversion experience. Some groups view it as 
accompanying conversion; others believe it is a separate, sanctifying 
experience which empowers the Christian for service and holiness 
of life. 
Bom Again: Term used to describe the experience of Christian con¬ 
version and accompanying new life in Christ. See John 3:1-8. 
Broadman Hymnal: One of the earliest Southern Baptist hymnbooks 
to be published by a convention agency, published 1940. 
Brush Arbors: Open-sided structures built from rough hewn poles 
and covered with brush to provide shade for worshippers. 
B YPU: Baptist Young People’s Union organized in 1890 as a service 
and study organization for young people in Baptist churches. Taught 
scripture, doctrine, morality, and community responsibility to Bap¬ 
tist youth. Formally disbanded in 1941. 
Call to Preach: Term which describes a sense of divine guidance 
leading toward a vocation as a preacher and minister. 
“Churching”: A term used to describe disciplinary practices in which 
church members are expelled for behavior unbecoming to a Chris¬ 
tian. 

============================================================
PAGE 491
============================================================

GLOSSARY 
489 
“Close CommunionA practice for determining those who may or 
may not receive the Lord’s Supper. In its most common form close 
communion permits only members of a local congregation to receive 
communion in that congregation. 
Cottage Prayer Meeting: Gatherings of Christians in homes for prayer, 
Bible study, and mutual exhortation. 
Falling from Grace: The turning from salvation by one who earlier 
claimed Christian conversion; rejecting the grace of God which has 
earlier been received. 
Foot Washing: Observed in many Baptist and Pentecostal churches 
as a symbol of community and humility. See John 13:1-16. 
Laying on of Hands: Usually observed at the ordination of ministers 
or deacons, symbolizing their being set aside for service in the 
church; some administer it to all candidates following baptism; oth¬ 
ers lay hands on the sick along with prayers for healing. 
Missionary Baptists: Describes those Baptists who favor the support 
of missionaries, home and foreign, as opposed to anti-mission Bap¬ 
tists who repudiate the need to send out missionaries. Missionary 
Baptists may be represented by those churches which support indi¬ 
vidual missionaries directly, rather than contributing to a central 
mission agency. 
Missionary Circle: Gatherings of women for study and support of 
mission activities, home and foreign. Serves as a basic source of 
mission education in local churches. 
Mourner’s Bench: Special section in many revivalistic churches where 
sinners could go to mourn their sinful ways, receive words of encour¬ 
agement and prayers of the faithful. 
Postmillennialist: A view of the millennium which suggests that Christ 
will return following the church’s establishment of the kindgom on 
earth. The church helps to bring in a “golden age” of religious 
and moral enthusiasm. 
Premillennial: A particular view of the second coming of Christ which 
stresses his return prior to the thousand year reign of peace on 
earth. Christ returns, “raptures” (takes up) his church to heaven, 
chaos strikes the earth, Christ brings his church back to earth, and 
reigns a thousand years. See Revelation 20:1-7.

FOXFIRE 7 
Protracted Meeting: A series of revival services extended over a period 
of days or weeks, sometimes ending only when religious enthusiasm 
wanes. 
Revival: A series of church services held for the purpose of renew¬ 
ing the zeal of church members and converting non-Christians to 
the faith; may also refer to a dramatic resurgence of spiritual fervor 
in the church. 
Sanctification: The process of growing in grace; living the Christian 
life in holiness and manifesting the “fruits of the Spirit” after conver¬ 
sion. In some churches sanctification occurs in a decisive experience 
following justification (conversion). 
Saved: Term used to describe the experience of Christian conver¬ 
sion, i.e. “saved” from hell, “saved” to new life in Christ. 
Singing Schools: Song fests where the “shaped-note” singing was 
taught to enable those with little musical background to read music; 
occasions of religious enthusiasm and community life. 
Sunbeams: An organization for children in Baptist churches. It 
stresses music, missions, and Christian virtues for preschool and 
elementary age children. 
Supply Preacher: A visiting minister who preaches in the absence 
of the regular pastor. 
Tent Maker. Name for a bi-vocational minister, who receives little 
or no salary from a church and is supported by employment outside 
the church. See Acts 18:3. 
Testimony Meeting: Services in which believers testify publicly as to 
their personal encounters with God, and relate various types of reli¬ 
gious experiences. 
Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting: A weekly gathering of church mem¬ 
bers for Bible study and prayer. A particularly strong tradition in 
Baptist churches.

Foxfire Records Now Available 
Foxfire is proud to announce the publication of two LP recordings, 
designed to accompany the material presented here in FOXFIRE 
7. For five years now the Foxfire students have been making field 
recordings of the Rabun County Gospel Singing Convention in 
Georgia, and the Christian Harmony Singings in Dutch Cove and 
Etowah, North Carolina. Both of these recordings are enjoyable 
and informative pieces of documentary research, recorded on loca¬ 
tion at actual singings and accompanied by extensive interview mate¬ 
rial and historical research. They represent two distinct but 
concurrent “shape-note” singing traditions that survive today in the 
Southern Mountains. 
In addition to these recordings Foxfire Records has produced a 
fascinating documentary recording of instrument makers Stanley 
Hicks, Tedra Harmon, and Leonard and Clifford Glenn, all of whom 
were featured in FOXFIRE 3. The album, entitled It Still Lives, in¬ 
cludes banjo and dulcimer instrumentals, traditional narratives, and 
riddles. A twenty page insert provides interviews, transcriptions of 
recorded dialogue, and extensive research notes. 
Along with traditional musicians Foxfire Records features song¬ 
writers emanating from the region. The first in this series of records 
is North Georgia Mountains, by Joyce Brookshire, an urban-appalachian 
composer of country songs who grew up in the cotton mill village 
in Atlanta, Georgia. 
For further information, write to Foxfire Records, Rabun Gap, 
Georgia, 30568.

With more than eight million copies of Foxfire books in print, this \
h
<
volume—Foxfire 7— offers a wealth of the kind of folk wisdom and =
values of simple living that have made books beloved best¬ 
sellers for the last three decades. 
V 
T III in the Appalachian Mountains of Northeast Georgia, a teacher and 
ri : I l his students founded a quarterly magazine that they named Foxfire, after 
a phosphorescent lichen. In 1972, several articles from the magazine were pub¬ 
lished in book form and the acclaimed Foxfire series was born. Some thirty years 
later, the books continue to teach a philosophy of simplicity in living that is truly 
enduring in its appeal. Much more than “how to” books, the Foxfire series is a pub¬ 
lishing phenomenon and a way of life, teaching creative self-sufficiency, the art of 
natural remedies, home crafts, and other country folkways, fascinating to every¬ 
one interested in rediscovering the virtues of simple living. 
This seventh volume celebrates the spiritual heritage of Appalachia, and 
includes sections on baptisms, foot washing, and the songs and rituals of a variety 
of organized religions in the region—from Baptists to Methodists to Pentecostals 
to Presbyterians—as well as a variety of the kind of spirited firsthand narrative 
accounts from Appalachian community members that exemplify the Foxfire style.
