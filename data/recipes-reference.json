Store divinity in airtight containers lined with waxed paper."

        "FRESHNESS COUNTS: Accept nothing less than the very freshest when buying fish. First, use your nose. Fresh fish in any form has a fresh and mild odor.",
        "For whole, drawn, or dressed fish, look for shiny, taut, and bright skin. The eyes should be clear, bright, and often bulging. The gills should be bright red or pink and not slippery. The skin should be shiny, and the intestinal cavity clean and pink. The flesh should spring back and feel firm and elastic when pressed lightly.",
        "Fillets and steaks should have a moist appearance with clean cuts. Ragged edges and discoloration indicate poor quality.",
        "When buying frozen fish, be sure the flesh is frozen solid. Avoid packages with torn wrappers, or those with frost.",
        "HOW TO STORE: Cook fresh fish as soon as possible, preferably the day you catch it or buy it. If you can't cook it right away, wrap it loosely in clear plastic wrap and refrigerate it up to two days. For longer storage, wrap fresh fish in moisture- and vaporproof wrap and freeze. Frozen fish will keep up to 3 months.",
        "To thaw fish, place the unopened package in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours. Do not thaw fish at room temperature or in water because it will thaw unevenly and may spoil. Don't refreeze fish.",
        "To thaw fish in a microwave oven, place 1 pound frozen fillets or steaks in a baking dish. Cover with vented clear plastic wrap. Micro-cook on 30% power (medium-low) for 6 to 8 minutes, turning and separating the fish after 3 minutes. Let fillets stand 10 minutes, and let steaks stand 15 minutes."

To ensure that the food is safe to eat, bring to a full rolling boil; boil for 10 minutes. If the food is for use at over 1,000 feet above sea level, add one minute for each 1,000 feet of elevation.",

        "Generally expect to use 3 ounces of wine for each drink, getting about 8 drinks from one 750-milliliter bottle. For bigger parties, consider buying wines available in larger 1.5-liter bottles",
        "Remember to make a variety of nonalcoholic beverages available to your guests. Nonalcoholic Eggnog, Nonalcoholic Punch, or Homemade Soda Pop are a few choices",
        "Keep punches cold by floating easy-to-make ice rings in the serving bowls. To make an ice ring, fill a ring mold with water and freeze till firm. Or, for a fruit-filled ice ring, line the bottom of the ring mold with citrus slices, berries, or melon balls. Add enough water to just cover the fruit. Freeze till firm. Then fill the mold with water and freeze till firm",
        "Don't buy unnecessary types of bar glasses. Ten- or 12-ounce all-purpose glasses and 9- or 10-ounce stemmed wineglasses are suitable for nearly every drink and occasion. Disposable plastic glasses, available in various sizes, are convenient to use, especially at large parties"

        "CANNING: For year-round enjoyment, follow a canning process suitable food in standard canning jars, topped with lids and screw bands for an airtight seal. Select the freshest, top-quality produce. Sort out any bruised or underripe items.",
        "EQUIPMENT: A water-bath canner is used for processing high-acid foods such as fruits, tomatoes (with added acid), pickles, and relishes. The 212\u00b0F temperature produced in the boiling water is sufficient for these foods. A pressure canner is used for processing low-acid foods and vegetables. It reaches temperatures of 240\u00b0F to 250\u00b0F, the safe level for these foods. This canning method must be followed for safe canning of low-acid foods. A 16-quart pressure canner is ideal.",
        "JARS: Use only standard canning jars, and their mouths are specially designed to seal properly for canning. Run your finger over the mouth of the jars to check for any chips or cracks. Discard any jars with chips or cracks. Use them for dry storage only.",
        "LIDS: Use self-sealing compound bands and flat metal lids with built-in sealing compound. Carefully follow the manufacturer's directions when preparing them. Lids are designed for one-time use, but you can reuse screw bands if they are not bent or rusty.",
        "Foods are packed into canning jars by either raw-pack (cold-pack) or the hot-pack method. In raw packing, the uncooked food is packed into jars.",
        "Other useful pieces of equipment are: a large kettle or Dutch oven, wide-mouth funnel, jar lifter and food mill, colander, or sieve.",
        "STEPS: 1. After the jars are completely cooled, press the center of each lid to check the seal. If it dips up and down, the jar is sealed. If the lid bounces and reprocesses the contents using a clean jar and new lid, processing for the full length of time specified. Or, freeze the food (allowing 1/2-inch headspace). If you plan to use the food within a day or two, you also can refrigerate it.",
        "2. Wipe the jars and lids. Label jars with contents and date. Remove the screw bands. Store in a cool (50\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F), dry, dark place. Use the food within one year."
