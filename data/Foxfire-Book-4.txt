INTRODUCTION
T
here are several forces in the
lives of teachers that seem to
be universal. One of these
forces, despite anything we can do to counteract it, sees to it that certain
students will remain imbedded in our memories.
I've had my share, so far, of students like that. They are indelible. One of
them, a kid named Ernest, is one of those extraordinary human beings who,
while he was in our high school, set aside nearly every one of his weekends
to help me build my log house. He raised logs into place, cut out the win-
dow and door holes with my chain saw, set rafters—he was everywhere on
that structure, laughing and talking. Despite the fact that we were close
then, I lost track of him temporarily after he left our school, but I never for-
got him.
Several years later, during the September summer of 1976, I was in the
parking lot of our school on one of those scorching afternoons that bring ev-
erything to a halt. I was leaning against the side of my green pickup truck
talking to Lawton Brooks when I gradually became aware of another pres-
ence. I glanced backwards over the tailgate and saw there a skinny little
four-and-a-half-foot-high kid looking up at me, grinning out through braces
and from under a shock of blond hair, and wearing one of those yellow
football jerseys with black stripes around the sleeves, jeans, and a pair of
tennis shoes that must have been rescued from the trash at least twice.
He hesitated for a second, and then said, "Are you Wig? I'm Ernest's lit-
tle brother. He told me to find you when I got here. I'm David Flanagan."
And instantly a wave crashed through me, and I looked into that appre-
hensive little face and saw, one after the other, each face replaced by an-
other, an endless parade in which each student I had succeeded with, or
failed with, was replaced by another in a never-ending line—each with new
hopes and new needs and new expectations. And I felt things smashing
around inside of me that I can never remember feeling before.
It was important that that happen then, for during the same summer, we

INTRODUCTION
at Foxfire celebrated our tenth birthday while the nation celebrated its two-
hundredth. And I spent a lot of time doing—in regard to our organization
—what I assumed others were supposed to be doing in regard to the na-
tion: looking backward in order to see forward. I saw we had come a long
way, and I noted, with gratitude, that we had passed through some choppy
waters since I wrote the introduction to Foxfire 3, and we had come out on
the other side relatively unscathed—strengthened instead of weakened.
At the time I wrote that introduction, quite frankly, I was frightened.
The outside world had descended on us with such force that, from our per-
spective, we saw that world as the greatest single threat to our survival—a
force that could consume us, and cause us to lose sight of our perspective,
our main goals, and our main purposes.
And so we built a wall around ourselves and our kids. I'm convinced that
that was an appropriate—even vital—reaction to all the strange fists beat-
ing on our door. It gave us time to breathe, time, to regroup, time to get our
priorities back in order and figure out how to keep them there. For several
years we were more introspective than we had been in the past, and we ex-
perimented with our own educational formula in relative peace.
Large portions of that defense still stand, and appropriately so. They will
be there for as long as our organization survives. But from where I stand
now, I can see that other portions have been broken down, not from with-
out but from within, as we've gone through the same kind of maturing
process as an organization that we celebrate as we observe it in our kids.
That maturing happened, and is happening, I think, for two reasons.
First was the growing realization of how much our success had depended
on that very outside world we feared so greatly. When Foxfire magazine
was young, most of the significant events affecting our little project were in-
itiated in our behalf by others. Junius Eddy, for example, who was with the
Office of Education when I hit Washington one day begging for money. He
picked up a phone, called Herb McArthur at the National Endowment for
the Humanities, and set up an appointment for me that resulted in our first
significant grant.
Or Mike Kinney, a good friend and college fraternity brother turned edi-
tor who got us to put The Foxfire Book together and talked Anchor Press
into taking a chance on it.
Or this: Shortly after our corporation was formed, I was in Washington
again trying to recruit some men and women to serve on our advisory
board. Someone suggested Sam Stanley of the Smithsonian's Center for the
Study of Man, for at that time we were entertaining the notion that other
students in other cultures might someday want to do the same sort of thing
we were doing in Georgia, and since Sam was an expert in several Indian
cultures, we thought he might be able to be helpful. Sam was visited several

hours after I left his office by Brian Beun and Ann Vick of IDEAS, a pri-
vate foundation in Washington that was exploring ways of assisting various
Indian groups. Sam showed them the copies of Foxfire that I had left with
him, they got in touch, and on my next visit to Washington came down and
bailed me out of the jail I had been placed in because I didn't have enough
cash with me to settle a traffic violation I made in northwest D.C. rush-
hour traffic on the way to the five P.M. appointment I had with them; and
that meeting led to our eventual collaboration as consultants for dozens of
new Foxfire-type publications in high schools all over the country, and
opened up a whole new series of educational opportunities for students of
mine who were often invited by new projects to spend a summer on location
helping them get their first issue of a magazine together. Mike Cook, for ex-
ample, spent a summer in Ramah, New Mexico, helping to start the
Navajo publication, Tsa'Aszi', then majored in journalism at the University
of Georgia, and is now on our staff running our entire videotape operation.
Claude Rickman was able to spend a summer in Kennebunkport, Maine,
helping Pam Wood and her kids start their magazine, Salt; they now have
their first book out, and Ellen Massey's group in Lebanon, Missouri, that
publishes Bittersweet will soon have one as well. Recently IDEAS sponsored
the publication of two books designed to help teachers implement a Foxfire-
type project in their own schools. One of the books, Moments: The Foxfire
Experience, I wrote specifically for teachers. The other, You and Aunt
Arie: A Guide to Cultural Journalism, was written for students not by me
(and that's especially gratifying), but by Pam Wood and her kids at Salt.
And it was through IDEAS that I was introduced to the Highlander
Center in New Market, Tennessee, where I met Myles Horton, its founder
(a man I mention briefly in the introduction to Foxfire 2), and later Mike
Clark, its present director, and Guy Carawan, its music director. Guy intro-
duced us to George Reynolds, and George and his wife, Sharrod, are now
on our staff helping our kids do fieldwork in traditional music.
Often, I wonder what would have happened had Brian and Ann not
been able to come down to that police station and pay my fine for running
that stop sign on S Street in Washington.
Linkages. Moments when lives intersect and combine to the eventual
enrichment of both. We are not—and must not be—isolated if we are to
grow. Then, as now, that strikes me as being a very profound notion, for
those intersections in our lives, if welcomed, lead us on in ways we could
never have mapped in advance. It's an old notion ("Knowing how way
leads on to way . . ."); no less valid then than now. As worth noting now
as then. Again and again during those first ten years, new friends outside
our region unselfishly opened doors, linked us up with friends of theirs, and
so the network grew. And as this happened, so, too, came our growing reali-

INTRODUCTION
zation that implicit in the selfish acceptance of that generosity was our obli-
gation to take some of that energy and pass it on to others beyond ourselves
in ways that we had never tried before. And down came a piece of the wall.
Second was a realization, growing with equal force, that we had been
cheating our kids. Those who were not, at that point in their lives, able to
get caught up in and excited and motivated by the processes involved in
publishing Foxfire were cheated because that was all we had to offer. Those
who did get caught up in what we had to offer got cheated later for the
same reason—we could stretch them no further mentally or emotionally.
In addition, by being fiercely selfish in the examination of our own tiny
piece of the globe to the exclusion of others, we ran the risk of isolating the
students from the larger community of man that most of them would one
day have to enter. I have learned through hitter experience, for example,
that it is not enough for my kids to have an intimate understanding of their
own past, roots, and heritage. That is immensely important, but to be truly
effective citizens, they must next acquire an equally sophisticated knowledge
of their culture's relationship to others. We are a multicultural world, and
we are all linked one to another, for better or for worse.
In our rigorous self-examination, we ran the risk of tnaking some of our
students self-indulgent and defensive to the point where they could believe
that only their own community had value; and so sometimes they, as stu-
dents, erected the same kinds of walls that our organization had earlier
erected. So down came another chunk of the wall.
Retaining as our basic educational tenet our conviction that true educa-
tion must be more experiential than passive, we began slowly to add compo-
nents to our program that we hoped would productively engage those kids
who were not presently excited by print journalism, stretch those kids who
were in ways they had never been stretched before by our program, and es-
tablish linkages that would move them more actively beyond their own
community in terms of understanding and sensitivity.
One step at a time, we began to expand, strengthened and emboldened
by a new perspective on our roles and responsibilities as an organization;
adding each new component slowly, as it seemed appropriate and as it
seemed possible for us to implement, each being a natural, organic exten-
sion of our educational philosophy rather than an artificially imposed new
gimmick that could distract and fragment us.
We had always known, for example, that there is a larger Appalachia,
beset with staggering problems to which we owe allegiance, for we are all
fighting the same battles, facing the same foes. We arc now actively working
to build linkages with other Appalachian organizations, and assist them
wherever possible in the same way we were once assisted. When Pam Porter

============================================================

showed up on our doorstep one day from Atlanta looking for a job with us,
rather than hiring her for ourselves (since we reserve our staff openings pri-
marily for people from this community as jobs are almost non-existent
here), we sent her back to Atlanta to Cabbagetown, the desperately poor
Southern Appalachian neighborhood there that grew up around the Fulton
Bag and Cotton Mill at the turn of the century. Our kids then voted to give
Patch, the community organization there, a small grant with which they
could hire Pam, helped them get a second grant from the Georgia Arts
Commission to keep her employed there working with their kids, and then
rejoiced with them as they published a book of their own about Cabbage-
town that is filled with interviews with elderly residents along with recipes
and photographs. The book, Cabbagetown Families, Cabbagetown Food,
is being marketed by Patch to bring additional operating income into that
organization. Since it completely paid for itself in a matter of weeks after-
publication, other books are being planned.
In addition, we've worked out a program whereby kids from Cabbage-
town—many of whom have never been to the mountains where their
grandparents were born and raised—can come and stay with our kids at
our center for varying periods of time to learn more about what is meant by
roots; and my kids visit Patch to find out what an Appalachian ghetto is
like in the middle of a city.
We are also working closely with Patch to develop, in one of the aban-
doned mill buildings, a furniture industry that will turn out authentic hand
reproductions of mountain primitive furniture. My students, assisted by kids
from Cabbagetown, will scour our part of the mountains for patterns, re-
cord those patterns, produce a catalogue filled with photographs of the
furniture we can offer; and, with the help of local men, they will hire,
round up the necessary wood from local sawmills, cut out the pieces
according to the patterns, and truck the pieces to Atlanta for assembly
(with wooden pegs), finishing, and marketing by Cabbagetown residents
on a co-operative basis. We will split the proceeds, and use the profits to
provide additional jobs in both areas.
Using the royalties money that has come to us through the sale of the
Foxfire books, we have added staff members here, each of whom has the re-
sponsibility of developing a whole new range of projects and opportunities
and linkages for our kids:
Mike Cook, for example, has expanded our videotape program to the
point where we are now broadcasting programs filmed and edited by kids
on a weekly basis over our county cable TV system. The programs are not
only Foxfire articles on videotape, but also such things as in-depth studies
by students on such issues as clear-cutting on National Forest land, the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of consolidated schools (we are about to open

one in our county) versus neighborhood schools, and interviews with candi-
dates for regional political offices.
George and Sharrod Reynolds have, through new courses they are offer-
ing in our school, developed a file of musicians in the region, and have our
students now building an archive of traditional music. Out of this work has
now come a series of record albums recorded, edited, designed, and distrib-
uted by our students under our Foxfire label. The albums feature tradi-
tional musicians talking about and playing their music, mountain song
writers who are creating new music out of their roots (some of them are
from Cabbagetown), as well as mountain people talking about their lives,
their aspirations, and their dreams—our "personality" articles on albums.
Paul Gillespie and Suzy Angier have begun our regional publishing com-
pany, the first offering from which was produced by Suzy and her kids and
was titled, Memories of a Mountain Shortline. It is an oral history of the
fifty-seven-mile-long Tallulah Falls Railroad that used to run through our
county (and was so spectacular that Walt Disney used it as the site for his
film, The Great Locomotive Chase) but is now defunct. Paul is working
with students who are writing two more books: One is a sociological study
of mountain religion that includes interviews with over fifty mountain
preachers, each of whom was over eighty-five years of age; the other is an
oral history of everyone of the log buildings that have been reconstructed at
our educational center, along with a photographic record of their moving
and reconstruction. Margie Bennett, in addition, is working with students
who are interviewing black Appalachian residents for a forthcoming study
of the black experience in the mountains.
Our students have also designed and built log playground structures for
two elementary schools, have designed and equipped two woodworking
shops at our center, and laid out one nature trail. By the time this book is
published, we will have added a staff member who will be working with
them on environmental studies, and will be building a greenhouse with
them for use as a laboratory.
In every instance, these extensions are offered in the form of courses
within our public high school, and the students who are involved in them
receive full scholastic credit for the work they do with us. All this from a lit-
tle high school magazine, the first issue of which was paid for by a commu-
nity that believed in our potential.
And it is only in that growth—that welcoming of appropriate linkages in
our lives and that receiving and giving of energy—that we live and mature.
Cut off, like so many old people we have met, we shrivel and become dust.
Cut off, like so many high school students we have met in classrooms
around this nation, we atrophy.

swallowed up in one corner of one suburb of any major city—I must con-
stantly remind myself that it is only through rejoicing at the opportunities
provided by these extensions of our original work that I and the staff I hire
can build a network of experiences and opportunities for kids that will con-
nect them to themselves, to their school, to their community, to their region,
and to the world; and provide for each student an endless number of en-
trees into that world, and an endless measure of determination and belief in
their capacity to act responsibly and sensitively and morally within it. This,
rather than throwing them naked onto the world's streets with no more
blessing than a half-remembered graduation speech.
All of us, as teachers, must have an infinite measure of hope for human-
ity on this rock as it whirls through space, and an infinite measure of deter-
mination to get better at this job each year and to correct the insane mis-
takes we make with such distressing frequency. For always, in lock step, one
behind the other, constantly appearing behind the tailgates of our pickup
trucks, fresh-faced, open, scared, hopeful, shuffling in tennis shoes, and grin-
ning out through braces come the David Flanagans, asking where we stand.

he letter on the opposite page
arrived in our office one day,
and sent us all in search of a
map of North Carolina that could show us where Vilas was. Mr. Hartley
sounded like someone we'd like to meet. We found, to our delight, that
Vilas was near Sugar Grove, and we had already been in communication
with a Tedra Harmon there who made banjos and had agreed to show us
how (see Foxfire 3). We now had twice as much reason for a pilgrimage
into that part of the mountains.
We wrote Mr. Hartley back immediately and asked permission to visit
with him, received it, confirmed the dates with Tedra, and headed out only
to be turned back by the gasoline shortage that had closed every gas station
on our route. We returned home, tried it again two months later, and made
it.
The greeting we received from Charlie and his wife was so warm and
genuine that in the week we spent up there, their home became our base of
operations. None of us really know how it happened. It just seems that we
were constantly passing their little home on the way to another serendipi-
tous interview, and we'd stop in for a moment only to find that they had
anticipated us, and had a pot of coffee on the stove and pies on the table.
We touched base with them several times a day.
Subsequent trips up that way have kept the friendship open—a friend-
ship we are flattered by, and grateful for.
In the first part of this chapter, Charlie comments on the Foxfire books,
and fills in the holes he's found as he read carefully through them. In the
second part, we focus on Charlie's own life as a builder, mason, contractor,
family man, and remarkable human being.

FOXFIRE 4
Part I
They's a lot of this stuff that began to slip my mind until I started read-
ing these here Foxfire papers. But all that stuff is the truth. I bet they ain't a
word in there from them old fellers what ain't the truth. There's so much of
it I know. Now I've not done all of it, but they's a lot of it I have done. I've
made every piece about a wagon at one time or another in my life. I've
never built chimneys for log homes, but I've helped patch up one or two.
I've been with a lot of different people. I've worked nearly everywhere.
Now all of these old buildings that you'll find—all these log buildings—
was built before my day. I was born in a log house over here on Highway
105. And my brother was born there. Now we lived at what was known at
that time as the old Moss place. And we lived in a log house. In fact, there
was two log houses; and my wife's mother and daddy lived in one, and my
dad and me lived in the other. Now I'm just going to tell you what I can
remember. I don't think my daddy was ever as poor as I'm going to tell you
about, but my daddy was a poor man.
The real poor people that I can remember used ash cakes. Now that's
maybe something you don't know. If you happen to have a hearth, you rake
your fire coals or your ashes out on it. If you have your dough ready, you

laid it down on that and you covered that with coals or ashes. When that
got done, you'd take it up and shake the ashes off and eat it; and that's the
fun that the old poor men like my dad got to do.
Now my dad was poor, and they was a few of them poor people right up
and down the Watauga River and in Valle Crucis at the time. My dad was
a renter. We moved from place to place around there for several years be-
fore we got our own place.
I'm going to tell about one feller now—he's dead now—that I've always
had a lot of respect for. Back in the Beech Mountain country—I don't
know how it happened—but they settled some Hicks in there. And why and
where they come to get into the mountains, I don't know how it ever hap-
pened. But there was a set of Hicks. I built a house back there on that
mountain for a feller by the name of Ben Hicks, and he took a great interest
in telling me how they went along. But I built that house on the first lot
that the first Hicks that ever come into that mountain come to. And he told
me just what I told you'ns about ash pones. He said, "Mr. Hartley, you
won't believe it, but my dad and us lived on ash pones."
And he told me just the same tale that my mother and daddy—in fact,
my mother and daddy baked ash pones just to show us kids how to bake
them. And the truth is, I helped bake them myself for the curiosity to see if
I could bake them. And old man Hicks told me his poor little boy lived on
ash cakes when he first come to this country. But now by the time I was in
there, they had a good living—plenty of money. But they worked for it. I
don't know, but his old daddy, he told me how much land the old Hicks
had—I call them old Hicks because they was the first—and I believe it was
about twelve hundred acres of land.
All right, now, you take the washing business. Now Foxfire starts it with
a black washpot. Now they was absolutely no washpots at my knowing for
quite a few years. We used a brass kettle. It would hold, I would say, about
two bushels. Pretty good sized ones. Now that kettle was hung on two
forked stakes. One set up on one side and one over there. One was sorta
loose and you would pick up the crossbar on this end and carry it around—
set it on the ground if you wanted to, or empty it. Now that kettle—with
the whole community, that kettle was what they done all their washing in.
They cooked in it. They done everything they wanted in that brass kettle.
And the washing, now, they always had to go to a branch or a creek-—•
seems to me it was mostly a branch since it had more water at it. They got
ready to wash them clothes and they'd boil them out in that kettle with lye
soap. That's all we knowed in them days. I can't ever remember seeing a
cake of store-bought soap. [Then they'd carry the clothes to the branch in
tubs.] There must have been at that time some tub makers. In fact, my
daddy could make tubs. He had all the tools, but I never saw him make but

one. But we had a wood bucket. Now that's what we had at that time. You
put your clothes in it and carried them out here now to the branch and
tried to find a flat rock high enough for battling. Patty-cake with the
battling stick, we called it. All them battling sticks—well, I guess I've seen a
hundred of them—was made of red maple. Now you might wonder why
red maple? Well, red maple is a fine grain, and in beating on them clothes,
the grain stays smooth. Now you take oak, poplar or chestnut—it's got a
coarse grain to it if you remember. If you beat with that kind, it gets so that
it's rough and leaves streaks there and beats your clothes all to pieces.
Now that water, you can't rinse your clothes in a pond. You've got to
have your water running. We always tried to catch a place where the water
was running over the shoals or something—hold your clothes under that
and rinse them. Sometimes, if you didn't have that, you could manage: get
you a rock and roll him into the branch. Then when the water came
rushing over it, you rinse there.
Then you get to the place next where you have water running through
the heart of a log. Now the first log that I ever saw notched from the top to
carry water, I made it. We got to a place that was too level to wash in, and
we just absolutely had no place for water. My mother, she walked up to this
little poplar tree—I'd say about eight inches in diameter—and she said,
"Charlie, I believe you can cut this down and hew me out a log to run my
water through so we can pour it off."
I said, "Ah, Mother, I can't."
She'd seen one somewheres, of course: "Yeah. Chop it down, square it
off and leave the top on and I'll show you how it's done."
I chopped him down, squared him off, and I just started chopping along
there—chopping with the axe. Chopped a little notch down into it—what
they call a "V." Now that's the first one I ever saw, and I made it myself.
But since that time, I've seen hundreds of feet of them.
Now that beating clothes on the rock, it does wear them; but them old-
timers had to do something. When we come along, it was much the same
way, and that's the way we done that.
Boil them, rinse them, beat them, go back and rinse them again to get the
wrinkles out of them, and then dry them. Hang them on the fence. 'Course
they wasn't no wire so they had to hang them on rail fences, bushes, poles—
stuff like that.
Now then, that wasn't just my dad and I that had to live that way. It
was all of them up and down the Watauga River. And all of them fellers
outside of my dad owned their farms. 'Course the farms was handed down
to them from their own forefathers.
I don't know what ever went with them brass kettles. I've no knowledge
of them going. A part of the folks had a six-foot brass kettle three feet deep.

============================================================

It was built up with rocks and mud—a wonderful job done with mud. You
can take red clay and make a wonderful job of that. Old Daddy Beard—of
course his daddy was sick; he'd been shot by a Yankee—now he had a six-
foot washpot. And Captain Ben Beard had one which had been handed
down to him by his daddy sitting back on the road. I've saw that several
times. It used to sit up by the barn there, and there's a little old branch goes
up the hill there on the right. It set there for years and years right at the
edge of that branch. And all the old-timers that I can remember that had
them six-foot brass kettles scalded their hogs in them.
Now then, I'm going to tell you a tale about black pots. I was a great big
boy, now, when the black pots come around. And in fact, I never thought
about where in the devil did them brass kettles get to until after I started
[this interview]. What happened to these kettles—where they went—I'll
never know. But now the first black pots my daddy ever had come from the
Hagamans. They owned a sawmill up here. And they'd started going broke.
A feller by the name of Moss owned it originally. Hagaman bought it, but
finally he went broke on that place there and owed a lot of money. Finally
he left there with his three or four boys. I've been told they left here in the
night to get away. Well, naturally when they got away, and them broke,
that big farm—something over four hundred acres in it but it wasn't worth
over much of fifteen or twenty dollars—that was taken away from him
[along with] what little stuff he had.
Now I can remember two items he had that my dad took care of for him.
One was one of these black pots, and there was a tub. My daddy saved
them until Tom, one of the boys, got sorta straightened out. They never did
get this place back here back. There wasn't no use 'cause the people had al-
ready took all they had. You couldn't blame them for not coming back and
paying off after all that they'd had had been took from them. But Tom
come back to visit my daddy, and Daddy took him out there and showed
him what he had saved for him. And he looked around and said, "Well,
what good are they to me? I can't get them home." He said, "You just take
care of them."
Now my dad, that's how he got his first black pot.
We used that pot until we burned one leg off—one leg off and a hole
through it. Now that sounds like that pot was ruined don't it? But my
daddy went to the blacksmith's shop and made him a piece of bar to fit
down through there and put a bolt and a little washer on there and tight-
ened her right up and we've used that thing for years and years now with a
homemade leg on it.
Now then, we come to the skillet. I think that my dad had a skillet when
I first remember, but I'm not positive of that. All of these folks now that I
knowed at that time had a skillet that you baked your bread in. When I was

a right small kid I can remember us baking pies in one—what we called
beef pies. Now that was up till I was pretty much grown. I don't think that
I ever had a biscuit to eat until after we bought a little farm. We finally,
after all that moving around, got a little farm of our own. Then we raised
our own wheat.
These old-timers, now, staying up and down Watauga River—beautiful
country, good living in there—they was faring just like the rest of us. They
were eating cornbread baked in the skillet. All of them done that. That's
how hard we lived back then. It was just hard, and that's all there was to it.
There was no stores when I can first remember. The first one I can
remember was a little store at Valle Crucis. It was right straight across from
where Frank Taylor's is now. But he didn't sell very much. He didn't have
nothing much. You might say he had the building. You didn't sell nothing
much then 'cause nobody bought nothing much. Now they didn't buy coffee
and shortening back in them days. You know what they used? Spicewood
tea. And red sassafrak tea. Now that's what they used. I never did see any
coffee till I was grown.
They didn't know what sugar was. They used molasses. When I first
remember, they was a lot of maple trees, and they made lots of tree sugar,
them old-timers did. Now I wouldn't be surprised when they wanted some
sweetening that they didn't use that maple sugar. They made a lot of it.
That's the first sweetening that I can ever remember myself was that maple
sugar. Them old sages knowed more than both you and me put together.
You got to give them credit for that. I wish you could go with me and see
some of the stuff that they worked out.
I don't know why it is, but they's a lot of people in this country here—
young people I'm talking about, educated folks—that wants some old-timey
stuff. Just a world of them. I had so much of it that I wasn't interested in
old-timey stuff. I never paid much attention [until recently]. [My wife]
bought what books I got. Then we got that Foxfire and we'd set up there
and we'd forget ourselves. Set up there and talk about old times. We'd set
up and set up and talk three hours at a time about old times, and she loved
to talk about them. And she gets a great kick out of me telling her about
that old-time business because I know it. Take number one Foxfire there.
I'm telling you the truth. That was so much word for word like I knowed—
every word through thataway. Until number two. Just for fun I wanted to
see how much [those kids had] missed [the truth]. But they didn't. If you
put two rocks out here together you couldn't make it no clearer than that is.
The board making was true. The log cabins was true, so truthful. Them old
haint tales and snake lore, I went through all of them. Except I never have
seen a blacksnake kill a poison snake. I've heard that talk all my life. I did
talk to one man in Maryland, and I guess he told me the truth. He said he

============================================================

was out in one of them old fields, and he went into a fine blackberry field.
And they was so nice and sweet he stopped in there to eat some berries and
he heard something coming down through the briars. That's the way he
told me now. He got to looking down to see what it was, and it was a rattle-
snake running from a blacksnake. And he said not long after they got
through the briars, the blacksnake caught the rattlesnake, and he had to
stay for that fight till it killed it. I never have saw that happen, but I've
heard lots of them tell they'd do that. And I believe there's one or two men
in Foxfire that said they'd seen that happen. I'm not sure—I never saw that
happen—but I'll tell you one thing. We lived near a copperhead den. We
had hundreds of copperheads around. But you take a summer where we
had a lot of blacksnakes and we didn't sec but very little copperheads. Now
that's a honest fact. But as far as seeing a blacksnake kill a poison snake,
I've never done it.
Now medicine is a late thing. You know what Foxfire says about the way
teeth was pulled? That's the truth as straight as you can go. It's going to
take an older man than I am to show me something in that old book that I
didn't know about. Everything's there that I know about. A lot of them old
remedies we used. Let me tell you something. There was eleven children in
our family. I'm the oldest one. A midwife took care of all of us but two. We
had no doctors, and we absolutely had to depend on the old midwife. That
old midwife would come out here and wait on you when you were sick or
having a baby. They was wonderful women.
And they could always find tea. I've heard doctors argue that that tea
wasn't worth a damn, but in my opinion, them midwives nine times out of
ten were pretty well right with that tea stuff they had. I was raised when
that's all the stuff we ever had. Made the tea myself. We had no doctors. It
was live or die. You got pneumonia fever back in them days and most of
them died. But a few old midwives lots of times would pull them through
even with the pneumonia fever. Them old people deserve a lot of credit for
what they done. The young doctors today, if they had to get out and do
what the others did, they'd sure enough be up against a stump.
We lack a lot giving the old-timer credit for what he done. He done
pretty doggone well. But one thing that I can't understand: what sort of
home did them people from England and Germany have that [made them]
come here to develop this country? Now my ancestors—the head of my
name—come from England. What sort of home was in England [to make
them leave] for this old rugged country? Two hundred years ago, and we
can't imagine what a wilderness this was. At least I can't, even if I have
been here eighty-seven years. It's a mystery to me. But another hundred
years from now they'll be somebody along here wondering what we were
doing. . . .

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
First old-timers that come here, they lived on game. They didn't have
wheat and corn and stuff like we do today. That's what they lived on. I'm
telling you, that old man that broke this river up, he deserves more credit
than he ever got. How in the dickens that ever come about, that's just some-
thing to think about. I've been in log houses. In fact, I was raised in one
that was two stories. Two-story log house, and them logs was just setting up
there just as fine, and they had nothing else absolutely to work with but a
pole axe and a broadaxe. That's all they had, and they knowed that was all
they had, and then achieved the houses that they built—wonderful houses.
And that's all they had, and they made them.
My dad was a good blacksmith, and I saw him lay a head on an axe. I
never saw him make a broadaxe, but all them had homemade axes now that
done the work. They were all homemade. And you could grind them axes
and whittle them down where you could shave the hair off your legs, and
how in the dickens them old-timers could ever temper so good. But they
made them up in the country. There was blacksmithing. They kept their
work going. It might be possible that up in one settlement they'd have one
or two blacksmiths.
Now when it came to raising a house—old folks has told me this—when
old folks got ready to build a house (a new man coming into the settlement
or a new man got married)they'd pitch in there, get all them logs out, and
get all them logs together enough to build the house. Then they would have
a log rolling and get that house raised maybe in one day. I've talked to
fellers who did them, so I guess I've got it pretty straight. I've heard one
man say that he helped make a man a house out of poplar logs, and he said
he split them, hewed them out, got every log ready up through the rafters,
and then fifty men got in there and they laid that house up in one day.
After the logs is split and cut' out, there still is a lot of work to do 'cause you
have to notch them. Them notches was cut with a axe, and that was partic-
ular work back then.
And I want to tell you something that I've had a dozen people ask me, I
guess. How did them old-timers get their house level and square? You know
there was no levels. How would you get that log level? It's very simple, now.
Take a bucket of water and set it on there and stand and look at that water
with your eye till it got practically the same all around and you had it level.
It'll work just as good as my four-foot level. Now sure enough, that's the
way they did it.
And a great many of them old log buildings [north of here] was actually
covered with slate. In fact, I covered a bam that I built up there. Built a
barn forty feet wide and eighty feet long and covered it with the slate that
come off the old flint mill there. You ever read about that old flint mill that
was in Maryland? Well, they said the old flint mill was a hundred years old

============================================================

when they took it down. A man that I was working for up there bought the
slate roof for almost nothing. Twelve-inch wide and two-foot long slates,
and it was pretty much accurate. And that slate roof, now, was held on
with poles. Old-timers called it weight poles. Now that thing had stood on
there a hundred years, son, with weight poles on it. And that man bought
it, and the reason I know is that I'm the man that put it back on. Now that
roof never had a nail hole in it. I cut the holes myself. First slate I ever put
on. They got an old feller there—a regular slater—to come out there and
show me how to put it on. The man I worked with tried to beg him to stay
and help me do the job, but he wouldn't do it. He showed me how to put it
on and then he left. I wouldn't say that all of them log buildings was
covered with slate, but a great many of them was.
Now they was a great many weight poles used down here in North Caro-
lina. That's all they had. But those weight poles held boards on. Had board
roofs then. We never had no slate here. Every row of boards, you had to
have a pole. I was a board man myself. My daddy was a board man. The
first boards we ever began making was three-foot boards. And at that time
they had old cut nails. My dad and me together decided it would be best to
make a thirty-inch board, so we cut it to thirty. I'm the last man that was a
board maker living in Watauga County. My dad learned me, and my dad
was one of the best board makers here. I got pretty close to him [in skill],
but taking white oak I never did get as good as he was. It ain't much fun
making boards. But you take white oak or chestnut oak, you can split a
board down pretty thin. I got to where I could split a half-inch board—
make them all a half-inch thick. My dad was so good he could take that
and divide it again. Make two boards out of a half-inch. But that, of course,
was just to show you it could be done. You don't want a quarter-inch board
for a roof. That's entirely too thin.
The half-inch board really worked the best of anything you could have.
And that thirty-inch long board worked awful good. Later on they was a
few got to making twenty-four-inch boards. Now that's not a bad board.
Make them twenty-four inches long and put them on shingle fashion. Board
fashion, you know, you lap it six inches. Shingle fashion you lap two-thirds
the length of the board.
I've slept under them old board roofs. I'd just get up in the morning and
throw snow off. Clean up the house so you could get breakfast.
And chimneys they was several stick and mud chimneys here. Now
that's a beautiful chimney. Lay your logs up and pack your mud in them.
They actually had a fire in them. There was enough mud in there so you
could build your fire down here and it went right on. There's a great many
of them, and I don't know why it can't be done today.
And brick 
the first brick that I ever remember being made in Watauga

============================================================

was made of mud, red clay. They had a machine made, they called it the
mud machine. Throw that red clay in there, and add water in it. It had a
hopper too, understand. Had a yoke of oxen hitched to it to pull that thing
around and around. They got that mud mixed up and put it down here in
square molds. Set it in the sunshine to dry. When that got thoroughly dried
then, you had a pretty fair brick, but now it didn't last too many years. I
sorta believe I have a recollection of something said about a straw brick too
[with straw added to the mud for additional strength]. And they was a
good many of them homemade bricks used in them old times. I seen a good
many of them used in mud brick chimneys.
[Later, sawmills began to produce building lumber.] I can take you back
to the first old-time mill there ever was around here. The first sawmill ever
put in our county was what we called a sash saw. Went up and down. Now
you've seen bandsaws. A bandsaw goes over a pulley and comes down
around another pulley and cuts always going down. A sash saw goes up and
cuts as it goes back down, but it goes up and down straight. Right up and
down straight. And now then they had an overshot wheel. There was noth-
ing but the overshot wheel in it for power. That belonged to Henry Taylor.
He owned that first mill, and it set way up the road yonder down near the
little old creek we call Crab Orchard Creek. And why it was called Crab
Orchard Creek, it come down off the mountain and there must have been a
space cleared by the Indians—a little space in there about two acres. That
was the thickest place of crabapples I ever seen, and that's what give it the
name.
They wasted a good bit of timber at those mills, but timber was millions
and millions of feet. What did they care? Go out in the mountains and cut
a poplar down to make something out of. Maybe it was two feet through. If
it didn't suit them, go up and cut another and throw the other out.
But that's the first sawmill that to my knowledge was ever in our county.
When the modern mills come out, Henry Taylor put him a modern mill
right by the side of that one. That sash saw was powered with water
though. The water came down in the flume and poured into the buckets on
the overshot wheel. It was geared up with wooden cogs to pull your logs
backwards and forwards. You didn't pull that. I don't much believe they
cut a log over twelve feet long on them, but that's the way it was. And
wood cogs made of hickory or black walnut. And for a drive shaft most of
them tried to get red maple. I'd say the first one I ever saw was red maple.
I saw some of oak once. In fact, [my wife's] grandpa on her mother's side
had a mill that he run for years. That was with a turbine wheel. That's
where I first saw the turbine wheel. It had a overshot wheel first. Well,
when the time come and the water wheel give out—them old-time wheels
would give out, understand; they didn't last a lifetime—somebody came

along with such and all about this turbine wheel and he recommended it
and told him how it worked down in there, and grandpa put one in. Now I
didn't see him put it in, but I can tell you what I did see and know. We
moved over about two miles from the mill, and we made it a practice to go
to that mill. And when me and Walter, my brother, first started packing
corn over the mountain to it, we took a peck apiece. He was sorta grouchy,
and you'd think he was a old hellcat till you got used to him. But he was
friendly. That was just his way. I went up there one time with some com
after his turbine wheel had been put in there, and he had overrun the thing
and he'd got some trash lodged right down in that wheel. And when I
walked up, there was grandpa down in there cleaning that wheel out. I set
my bushel down on the floor, walked down there, and I said, "Could I help
you some cleaning that out?"
He said, "Godamighty yes you could."
I said, "All right, where do you want me to work?"
He said, "You stand over there right close to the water there and I'll
hand all this stuff over to you and you pitch it over on the bank there, and
when it gets dry, we'll use it for wood.
Well, I helped him get it cleaned out good, and while we was cleaning it
out, he showed me it was steel, and how all the water and all went down.
He took a liking to me quick as I fell down to helping him. We got it good
and cleaned out, and he said, "Now Charlie, you stand right there until I
get the water turned on and let me see if it works."
He turned it on and see'd that it worked pretty good, and he said, "Come
on, Charlie. That's gonna be just fine."
We went up there and he said, "Charlie, you've been good to help me.
I'll grind you as much corn over a bushel as you can get back home." And
from that day till that old man died, he was a real friend to me. I could go
over and talk to him and he'd be just as nice as you please.
Now for payment he'd take, let's see. There's ten gallons in a bushel. He
took two toll dishes out of a bushel. That would be a gallon. If there was
just a half a bushel, he took one. If it was a peck, he didn't toll it. There
was a law for old-timey millers that you couldn't toll a peck. If it was less
than half a bushel, he didn't toll it. All of them done that way.
One time the county here raised wheat. I don't guess they raised more
than corn, but when they got to grinding wheat, that was when the farmers
were getting pretty well straightened out. First old thrashing machine I saw
was a wood thrashing machine.
Before that, what little they raised they used a frail [flail] on. That's
maybe something you don't know. Now they had to have a place to hold the
grain. They laid the grain down. Some of them laid it flat down on the floor.
And this frail was about, I'd say ten feet long. It was hinged at one end.

============================================================
PAGE 24
============================================================

ETTA AND CHARLIE ROSS HARTLEY
27
You had your handle back here, and you come up with it and then come
over and down on the wheat with one whomp. The frails was usually a
hickory withe wrung around and around [at the joint] so the end would
flip. Beat the old stack of wheat with that end till you got it done. Then take
a cloth and take your wheat up and clean it in the wind. That's what they
first done I understand. But later on they got to be a small-like windmill
that was made with wood and cogs. There was an old one that set up here.
I don't know what ever went with it. But that was cranked by hand—had a
fan in it—and you could run a bushel of wheat through that and clean it
pretty quick. It had a hopper just like a mill hopper. You just pour your
wheat right in and there you go. All of that now was handwork until the
thrashing machine. Then take that wheat to the mill.
At one time before big mills come in, they was a right smart of hammer
mills around North Carolina. You have to have water to flip that [hammer
end] up and down. But you go to all that expense to have water to run
through there to pull it up and down that way, why not have the wheel?
I believe I'll say this: I seriously doubt if they's a thing that they can ever
write you about in the old-timey business that's actually never been here,
but finding the man that knows about it . . . Now this old North Carolina's

been set up a long time. A lot of this stuff I'm telling you about tonight is
way back yonder, and it's real survival.
Now they had turning lathes that were water-powered too. We had al-
most nothing back in them days only what was run by water. They was a
few lathes turned by hand too—a big ten-foot wood wheel hooked to a
spindle. Now I can't remember too much about that big wheel, but I can
remember that grandpa run it until—have you heard talk of the '40 flood
here in North Carolina? Well, he run it up till then. We" had a flood here
in '40 that cleaned this whole country out. Water stood up on the porch
within three inches of the floor, and us on a little creek, too. That flood
cleaned everything out, now. Took everything.
Now all of that stuff come along up to where we hit Foxfire 1 and
Foxfire 2, which is just so accurate there's no use to talk about that.
Part II
In the second section of this chapter, we try to cover Charlie's career as
a builder—a talent he learned not in school (he never went to college) but
by experience alone. Many of the buildings he built are still used con-
stantly today, though few of the people in his surrounding community
could point them out to you. He did his work quietly and then stepped
aside. Those buildings he is proudest of he supervised during WPA days,
but his career spanned more than fifty years.
There are many things that make this couple noteworthy, not the least of
which is the durability of their partnership (they've been married sixty-five
years) and their large, close-knit family (they have four children, twelve
grandchildren, and twenty-three great-grandchildren). When they mar-
ried, Charlie was twenty-two and Etta was sixteen. They were introduced
by Troy Banner, one of the knife makers featured in this book. "I robbed
the cradle for her," says Charlie. "That's kind of a joke, but it's the truth.
I did take her out at sixteen. I reckon that's the worst mistake she ever
made—listening to me!"
Equally amazing is the amount that Charlie accomplished despite his
lack of formal schooling; and more amazing still is the fact that he did all
of his finest work after losing one leg in a logging accident fifty-five years
ago. He gets around on a peg leg made by hand out of a two-by-six.
Etta warned us that if we encouraged him, he'd brag. We encouraged
him, and I'm glad we did because their story is one that's worth telling.
And though the pride is there, it is tempered by-an almost childlike awe at
what was accomplished, and a keen sense of disappointment now that the
work is done. As Charlie said, "Sometimes I walk around, see buildings that
I put up, and I say, 'Was I man enough to put that building up,' when I

============================================================
PAGE 26
============================================================

ETTA AND CHARLIE ROSS HARTLEY 
29
know darn well I put it up. I'm going to say sotnething to you that I've
never said to nobody else. I have went to the top, as I've told you, and been
where I had to take the bull by the horns—swim or die. And she's been by
me. Always been on the bank when I was in trouble. But that's what I've
had to do. And I have never run onto a man that could out me in building,
and even on this one leg I have never struck a man that could do as much
work in a day as I could. I've learned to do the job fast when I had two
legs, and when I thought I was knocked out, got to messing around with
my brother taking jobs and began to work a little and found that I wasn't
knocked out at all.
"And I've never been stalled. But I'm gone now. I ain't no good now.
Nobody needs me now 'cause I ain't no good."
That's not true, Charlie. Your family needs you, and we need you, be-
cause the two of you give all of us a pattern to go by, and a ray of strong,
clear light to rejoice over.
We began by asking Charlie to tell us what sort of education he had to
prepare him for his career in construction. He began to laugh, and what
follows is what he told us.

Let me tell you something. There was just a little school. We had school
three months [out of the year]. It was supposed to he three months, but
might' near always there would be window lights knocked out and they
would have to fix that, and it would cut the schooling down to about near
two and a half months. It was years and years before we ever got much of a
school. But now I didn't go to school too much. After I got big enough to
go to school, my dad used to say he would try to give us an education.
Now my dad was wrong, but he did the best he could. When he would get
hard up, he would come and take us out of school. So in a way, I got about
two months schooling in a few years. That's the way it went.
We lived at Valle Crucis when the Episcopals come here and started
their school up. They are great folks to try and help you get an education.
The old fellow that started that talked Daddy into sending his four oldest
children to that school for seven cents a month. So we went to school a part
of a couple of years there. In fact, to be honest, the part of the education
that I got, I got it through the Episcopals. Now I'm not an Episcopal, un-
derstand, but I will give them credit for what they done for me. Bigger part
of my education come through them, but I ain't got much education. I
doubt with all my experience that I could pass a fifth grade examination
with arithmetic.
So I never got much school. I really started being a carpenter when I was
a kid. My daddy was an old-time carpenter. One of the best that's ever
been, and [he] could do the most work, but he didn't have much education
[either]. I really started in messing with his tools and learning carpenter
work—he says six years old. He had a box of fairly good tools, and they was
kept locked up. He kept the key in his pocket most of the time. Once he was
building a spring house, and he had about a mile to walk from home to that
job, and he'd get lonesome. He got to taking me with him to sorta pass the
time away. Well, when he got ready to put the roof on, I just couldn't be-
have my little self; I had to climb that ladder and carry shingles up to him.
That's old-timey shingles, now. Then that didn't satisfy me and I had to get
up and help him. On the last—getting away up—he didn't want to put the
last scaffold on. He throwed him a two-by-four up and with one hand held
that and laid the shingles with the other, and I got up there and nailed
them—two nails to the shingle. That's the first work I can remember.
My father taught me a little. He taught me as far as he could go. We
worked together lots. We were the first ones that ever started putting water
pipes to a man's house. I guess you've read about the Mast Store in the
papers? Now right across the road there is the first house he ever owned. He
come to Valle Crucis a single man and he married there. Now away around
up the hill there was a good spring and a little stream of water running into
a little wood spout. He got it there and carried his water back to his house.

============================================================

ETTA AND CHARLIE ROSS HARTLEY

So Mr. Mast come back one day from dinner a little bit late. We was set-
ting out on the porch of his store. He come walking up—and he has a by-
word. "By gracious." He said, "By gracious, I had to go up to the spring
and fix [the spout back] so my wife could get some water."
His brother-in-law was sitting there; he sorta looked up, "By junkies,
well, why don't you go up there in the mountains at that good spring way
up there in the hollow at those white pines and pipe that spring down here
to the house? Save walking.'
"By gracious, do you mean that?"
"By junkies, of course I do."
"Well, I believe I'll run it down there." Turned around to me. Said,
"Charlie, how about you and Walter and your dad coming down here and,
digging the ditch up there and getting it ready? I'll try to get some piping
up here from Johnson City [Tennessee]. I believe I could buy it and get it
in here."
Well, I come home and told my dad what they wanted. Dad said, "Yeah,
we'll go down there and we'll put that ditch up through there." It took
about three days to get an order from Johnson City up here at that time,
and by the time we got the ditch dug, the piping was in. Well, now the
Episcopal School over there, they had a line of water off the top of that
mountain, and they had a pipe wrench up there. Mr. Mast borrowed that
one pipe wrench and we put all that pipe all together with that one pipe
wrench, now. Covered it up, run it down here in the barn lot—still seventy-
five feet from the kitchen—and set it up like that. We had nothing to cut
pipe with, understand. We took that pipe—it's really hard for me to believe
it could be done, but I done it—and took a little handsaw file and filed
around that pipe and cut it in two with that little file. Then we still had to
bend it. We had two of us and we bent that pipe up and stuck it standing
right up there in the barn lot—no sink, nothing. Water come up there. Of
course it wasn't but a few days till it was muddy all around it.
Went down to the store one day. Mr. Mast was about half mad—water
and mud all over him. He said, "Charlie, by gracious, I've just got a
mudhole over there. Just look over there at what a place I've got. Would
you and Walter, if I can borrow the Mission House tools, come down here
and change that?"
"Yeah, we'll come do the best we can for it."
We went down there and we moved that pipe. Time had come that he
could buy a sink, and so we run that water out there—bending the pipe by
hand now, understand—and left the runout a'pouring there [into the sink].
"By gracious, how arc you going to get that water away from the house?"
"Gosh, Mr. Mast. I don't know. All I know is just dig a ditch and just let
the water run out down through there."

Well, that didn't make it much better. You still had the same water run-
ning down except you had water in the kitchen now. Went back down a
few days after that.
"Charlie, I want that pipe changed someway. The Mission says they'll
loan me the wrenches."
I said, "All right. We can cut and twist that around." We went over
there and fixed that. Then that's where I stopped [working] with him. But
from then on, I eventually got to where I could buy one pipe wrench. The
first job that I done after that, I done it with a pipe wrench and a little file.
Didn't even know a hacksaw then. Probably they was made somewheres,
[but we didn't know about them]. But now that's the way I started my
first plumbing.
After Mr. Mast had water pumped in, it got to be a great thing; and
now right over there in Mrs. Henson's house is the first bathroom and tub
that was ever put up in Watauga County. She got the first bathtub that was
ever put in Watauga County, and it's still there. At Valle Crucis, Harley
Taylor put in the second one, and I was the helper on it. When we got that
job done, the plumber in charge walked over and said, "Charlie, I'll give
you the same price as I'm getting to go with me to Johnson City as a
helper."
I said, "I ain't got no use in Johnson City. I've got a home up here. I
ain't interested in going down there and help you plumb." I stayed at
home. I didn't go. And from that [time] on till I've got so I can't plumb,
off and on I've been plumbing. And these plumbers up here that I patron-
ize now, they're a little better than me on copper tubing and such as that;
but so far as knowing plumbing, they don't know it a bit better than I know
it because I come right on up. I concreted the first spring that was ever
concreted here, and that's quite a job—bringing the water around, make
your cement box—it's a right smart job. I run one one time twelve hundred
feet. That's a right smart distance, but I've done that.
And so far as a plumber, if I was able to do my own plumbing [now] I
wouldn't let them put in my plumbing for a dime. I wouldn't let them have
a dime because I've never seen a plumber do the work exactly the way I
want it done. I have to patronize them now. I've had them down here two
or three times in the last five years. When I go in there (they're Republican
and I'm a Democrat) I go in at the door and say, "Hello there. Old
Democrat's in trouble today. You gonna help me?"
They might near always say, "Why, yeah, we're gonna help you. We
ain't gonna turn you down."
But now the time's come when I can't do nothing. But I could boss. My
old head ain't so crazy yet that I don't know how the job's done!
Now up till I was seventeen, my dad was the boss absolutely. The way he

============================================================
PAGE 30
============================================================

ETTA AND CHARLIE ROSS HARTLEY 
33
said it was what went. I was under him. Next thing I was doing, I was on
my own going out here maybe three miles or five miles. Take charge of a
house and build it with one or two hands. Build it myself without even a
blueprint. Now we didn't know blueprints when we first started. Those nice
big catalogues come out with all the beautiful homes—just pictures. Folks
would pick out a picture of a certain house, "I want one built like this." No
blueprint or anything. I built that house by looks just identical to the way
they wanted it. Somebody'd come along: "Where's your blueprint?"
"Right up here" [pointing to his head].
I always got just what they wanted. I'm not a natural-born carpenter,
understand. They say my father was a natural-born carpenter. I don't
know. I don't think anybody's ever natural-born for any trade. He may be
born with a sense of following in his daddy's tracks, but he's got to learn it
is the way I see it. Up till I was seventeen, I was practically on my own be-
cause my father couldn't see the newer ways. And he absolutely couldn't
stand for one of his children to tell him anything, and the time come that
me and him quit. Then I was on my own absolutely myself. It might be
farm work today, and tomorrow it might be carpenter work.
After I went on my own, I soon got to the point where I didn't have to
go and ask for a job. They asked me. When I was eighteen years old, I was
far enough along in the carpenter business that I could go out on my own
hook and build a house, and it was considered good. And repair work—
there was about six or eight women in Valle Crucis who wouldn't let
nobody else do their work but me, so I didn't have to go out and ask for
work at that time. And then I went to Tennessee, and made three trips to
Maryland to build dairy barns. I was my boss and done the work too with
maybe one hand.
Same way here. I'd go out in the mountains—some asked me to build a
home. In them days, you'd go out and stay with them—board with them.
Go out, build a house and stay with them till it was done. Stay with the
people I was working for. That was customary then. But since World War
II, there ain't no such thing as that. A man comes and wants you to do him
a day's work, or build him a house, and you look after your own board.
That's all done away with. But now that's kindly the way I worked. And in
most cases, they had a hand in the community that would be able to help—
not a carpenter, understand. I hardly ever had a carpenter. I'd go out there
and pick up a laborer—anybody that could help me. I done the bossing and
part of the work, and we both went together that way. I have never built a
whole house by myself because you can't put the rafters up by yourself. And
it's mighty hard to raise your frame- one man.
And now about the only tools I had were a hand saw, a hand axe, and a
drawing knife. The first few houses, now, I built were not storm sheeted—

============================================================
PAGE 31
============================================================

34 
FOXFIRE 4
weatherboarded. When they began storm sheeting, it went up and down at
a forty-five [degree angle]. We cut all that by hand. And a few jobs that
I've done, now, was old hard wood that was taken from the sawmill. The
culls that wouldn't pass for market would pass on into subflooring and storm
sheeting, and it all cut on a forty-five, and with a hand saw for the first few
years.
And on a lot of them buildings I've put up, that lumber was not sur-
faced, and you had worlds and worlds of maple and oak to cut on a forty-
five. Now let me tell you the difference. Twelve-inch boards cut straight
across is just exactly a twelve-inch cut. But when you start at a forty-five, it
takes nineteen inches to cut that forty-five. That's the difference in doing it.
I even built one or two that I had to put a forty-five on the roof, which I
think was foolishness. Lumber going crossways on the rafters!
[So I was a boss on those jobs, but] when that WPA started, I had no
say-so. I had to show them what I could do. That's the way I started. I
started under the courthouse. I went over there and I excavated under that
courthouse—one of the hardest jobs that you can think of—to build a
foundation under it. I had sixty-five men. I had forty-seven the first morn-
ing I went in there. For forty-seven men, I had ten shovels. The bossman
came in and said, "Well, here's your crew, Charlie. You got ten shovels.
Can you handle them?"
I said, "I'll divide them—work one man awhile and work another one
awhile."
Now there was men standing right there hungry. That's the first big job I
ever started. And all these hands that came to me to work was what we
called "certified." They had to have a card that come from headquarters
showing me that I had the right to work them—all of them. And I had to
train them men to help me. When I started on WPA, I did not have any-
body but raw laborers and people that needed a job. Come in with overalls
double-patched and not enough to eat. I had to take care of them men and
work some too. All these big rock buildings I done with WPA during the
Depression were done with laborers that had to have a job. A fellow that
had a farm, they would hardly ever let him on 'cause they figured he could
live without it. Let's say it was a starvation job. A man on WPA was hun-
gry and naked and that's why he was put there. It was up to me to take
care of them. And it didn't make a damn bit of difference to them whether
I made him work or not work. I took care of him and kept him on the pay-
roll. If he was a good stout fellow and could work pretty well, let him work.
If he was sorta knocked out and not too stout, give him a light job. Let him
work awhile and play around. Now you may wonder how did I do all that
work—get these big buildings [put up] with that type of people. Well, I
had to have a little bit of know-how; and they is nobody—even you—that is

============================================================
PAGE 32

so dumb that he can't do something for me somewheres. If you've got pa-
tience, you can take anybody and train them for something. If he couldn't
use a pick, he could use a shovel; and if he wasn't stout enough to do much,
put him to carrying water. I got some criticizing along, but it was from
fellows who didn't know.
Now the Valle Crucis School is the first WPA job I bossed. I'm the man
that built that absolutely with common labor except laying the rocks. Now I
had a few men later on that were on the WPA that were good rock men,
but the County hired most of the rock men because they wanted a good job.
So that building standing over there will be a monument to my grave when
I'm gone from here. The first one I ever put up on WPA. It's still a beauti-
ful building. It's been there for about forty years now. Mr. Wigginton
[Foxfire advisor] went over there to look at that and stood there and
looked at it and said, "Mr. Hartley, I want to know how in the world you
done such a pretty a job as that is." Well, now, on that job, I had good rock
men.
Then I built a big rock building at Boone. And Blowing Rock has a big
rock gymnasium that I built. I'm proud of all of them, but the Cove Creek
School is my pride. That's the last one I built. You've been there and seen
it. That's worth being interested in. I think more of that job than any I've
ever done, but I had men there that was hungry.
During World War II, I was riding to town with two men. Driver
slapped the one in the middle to wake him up. Said, "Wake up. I've got
something lined up here I want to show you in a few minutes."

Well, I was wondering what he was going to show that man. Got up,
said, "Look over there. You see that rock building?"
"Why sure."
Said, "Don't you think that's something fine?"
He answered him, said, "That's the finest thing I ever seen."
Reach over and slapped me on that old wooden leg; says, "Mister, don't
you think that's a nice building over there?"
I said, "Naturally I'd think it was a nice building. I'm the man that built
it."
He looked at it and looked straight back at me. Says, "I don't give a
damn who built it. That's the prettiest thing I ever saw."
That was a great surprise to them that I was the little old peg-legged
fellow that built it. I wonder lots of times, "Did I do this?" But there's the
building to show. I guess I could pick out a hundred buildings around
Boone that I was the boss on. But Cove Creek is my pride. [The building
took two years to build. The architect was Mr. Coffee whose offices were in

Lenoir, North Carolina. Charlie was the supervisor and was over 106 men
for most of the time the building was under construction. Working with
him was an assistant superintendent, three building foremen, and a fourth
foreman at the rock quarry.
The walls of the building are twelve inches thick. The inside studding is
all two-by-six hemlock, and the floor joists are two-by-twelve hemlock.
There are wood floors and plaster walls. All the concrete pieces were precast
at the site.
The Federal Government paid for the major labor except for the three
Lyons brothers—Leslie, Clarence, and Earl—who were the main rock men
and were paid by the County. The County also paid for the materials.
Three other rock men, Ben Brewer, Guy Carlton, and Willard Watson were
paid by WPA.
So I didn't have much education, but I fooled the public and a lot of
fellows. I'm going to tell you one. That Cove Creek School that I bossed—I
went walking around with a fellow who was the checker. That's the man

============================================================
PAGE 35

watching to see that nothing was stolen. And he was with the engineers and
he knew well and good who was running that job up there. He knew that I
was buying all that material which was [the engineers' job]. The engineers
there should have made every one of them bills, but they did not do it. I
made all the bills and everything. And so I'm awalking around one morn-
ing checking my building and my men, and he was always kidding, and he
said, "Charlie, where did you go to college at?"
I said, "Good God, man, I ain't never been inside of a college."
And he turned around and said, "Don't be telling me a darn lie."
I said, "I am telling you the truth," and I like to have never convinced
him.
He said, "I want you to tell me how in the world—I know you are mak-
ing the bills for this job—how in the world are you carrying this job if you
never went to college?"
I said, "I got mine the hard way." And I did. I got mine through expe-
rience. I went to the top. At one time, I was the highest paid carpenter in
the County. At one time, I had as much as three calls a week. Right there is
the woman setting there [his wife, Etta] that can tell you that.
Now let me tell you something. We were supposed to work twenty-eight
days a month. Twenty-eight days is a working month. I took that Valle
Crucis School. I quarried the rocks out, hauled them in, done the ditches,
built that school up to the foundation—basement and all—at fifty-six dol-
lars a month. Now you study about that. What was I getting a day? I was
pretty near working on starvation wages too wasn't I? Finally the big white-
collar man come in. "What are you getting?"
And I said, "Fifty-six dollars."
"Chicken feed." And he walked off.
The next check come in and it was seventy dollars. In a few more weeks,
eighty dollars. By the time I got that building done, I was up at a hundred
dollars a month. And when I got through with that building, the WPA
white collars began to say, "Well, we got a man up there that knows what
he's doing." And when I finished the Cove Creek job, I had the white col-
lars coming to me asking me, "How we gonna work this? What we gonna
do?" That's the way I've come up.
ETTA: You're bragging now, Charlie.
CHARLIE: That's what I told you I was going to brag some! Even on de-
fense jobs when I was the little boss—the third man down, the one that al-
ways gets the beating and all the dirty work—they'd come around,
"Charlie, how we going to do this? How we going to do that?" And me fool
enough to tell them how and let them get the credit for it. You ought to
know what I mean. If you don't know, I can tell you: On all jobs any-

where, whenever you get to the point that you can go into any offices
around and be the best secretary there is there, there'll be a white collar ap-
pear over you telling you what to do. That's the way it'll be when you get
there, now.
But I guess I'd be safe to say I've built twelve or fifteen hundred houses
in my fifty years [as a carpenter]. And I always loved the work. Nowadays,
right now, they're storm sheeting with plywood, and some of them put only
four-foot pieces to each corner. Well, I don't know but that's all right, but it
certainly ain't as stout as what I had to build. I never had plywood to sheet
the side with. It wouldn't be quite as stout, but I guess it would hold if it
were put on right. Now plywood, you don't want to make just a straight
joint. Now that's what a lot of them do. Say you put in two sheets right
over each other. It's quick, and I reckon it'll hold. It's a lot quicker done.
It'll be all right till one or two of them blows away. Then you'll find out
one way or the other!
Back when you were making fifty-six dollars a month, what was Etta
doing?
CHARLIE: She was at home looking after the family. She has never
worked away from home. She stays at home and has been a real wife and
bossed the family, and we've got four wonderful children—but she's the one
that made them, not me.
ETTA: No, no, that's not true!
CHARLIE: I've worked away from home. Sent the money when I had
some. She stayed in those old rough mountains, steeper than anything. She
worked up there till her heart knocked her out. She's been there many a day
and worked.
Do you feel that a wife should stay at home and work?
CHARLIE [laughing]: I don't much want to answer that because I've
been an old fogey myself. I'd love to just turn everything entirely different
from what I done it then. If I could go back, I'd be an entirely different
boy and a man from what I've ever been. I believe I'd change two or three
things. One way I'd love to change would to be more friendly and polite.
My back life has been an old crabby life, mostly. If I could go back, I
wouldn't want that at all. I'd want it entirely different. That's about all the
way I know to answer that.
ETTA: I'd just wish to keep good health, I suppose, so I could work. If I
was young back again, I'd like to go into nurse's training. I love that work.
I took some, but I'd love to be able to work at that now, but my health
won't permit it. Back then my children were small and I couldn't leave

============================================================
PAGE 37

FOXFIRE 4
them and do what I wanted to do because I felt my duty was to my chil-
dren.
CHARLIE: There's two sides to look at. When I was raising a family, the
truth is there wasn't too much else for the women to do [away from the
home]. Back then, we considered the woman's place at home tending
to the babies—taking care of them. And she didn't only take care of the
babies—she went out in the mountains and worked. I'd send money when I
had some, and she done the best she could.
ETTA: I did the farming, in other words.
CHARLIE: And that's why I call her the boss [laughing again]. She
bossed so much she still can't help but boss a little!
ETTA: We had a twenty-six-acre farm. I'm still a little bit fogey now that
a woman should be at home with her kids. But the way times has got, living
is so high I don't see much chance only to let the wife work when she can.
Sometimes the wife can get a job when the husband can't. I think after the
children leave home, it's all right for the wife to get a job, but I'd rather be
at home to see that my children are taken care of up till they can go to
school.
CHARLIE: Mothers are working today letting their kids be carried and
tended to almost any way and sort of drug up by the hair of their heads.
[That's the cause] for a lot of this devilment.
ETTA: Fd like to sec some of this here crime and racket done away with.
There's getting to be too much of it. Now that's one thing that I would love
to see changed. Fll tell you one thing, and I'm going to be frank with you.
I've thought this ever since the second World War. The mothers went to
work on these here defense plants and things in place of staying at home
and taking care of the children. Of course, [the country] needed some help,
and everybody pitched in and helped all they could during the War. 'Course
that's something that you kids don't know nothing about. Well, it left the
children by theirselves. I think they just didn't have enough discipline in
other words, and they felt they weren't taken care of like they should have
been. Now I'd love to see more mothers stay at home. I think it could be
managed. I stayed at home and raised my children, and I know I had a
hard time, but I'd rather do with less and know that my children were
taken care of properly than left in anybody else's hands and just left to take
care of theirselves. Do you understand me? Now you're going to have to
work as best you can and try to improve things. Now I may be wrong in
what I think and what other people thinks, but I think that your children
comes first unless you absolutely have to get out and work for a living.
[Of course, the lessons parents try to teach kids now aren't so different

============================================================
PAGE 38
============================================================

ETTA AND CHARLIE ROSS HARTLEY 
41
from what they were back then. They just don't seem to be taking hold as
well now.] My parents, and so did his, always taught us to be honest and
truthful about everything, and I suppose most parents do now. At least I
did to my children, and I know parents that do teach their children that
now. And I think friendship and kindness goes a long ways. I tell you girls,
I was reading the other night on that, and on if you spoke kind words to
somebody, why, how it helped them more, so to speak, even if you didn't
like them. Maybe it made them feel better if you spoke to them kindly. And
it made you feel better. I think it does. Try to be kind to anybody, even if
they don't appreciate it or nothing about it, because you'll feel better about
it yourself.
And we taught our children to lie honest and to be truthful. That it
didn't pay in the long run not to be truthful. That usually it was caught up
with and it went against them. And another thing that I stressed on my
children was to never, never when they went to school to come home with
tattling tales of what the other students done or anything. I wouldn't allow
it at all. I'd punish them if they did. And they understood I would punish
them if they did. [Charlie] was away at work—maybe in Maryland or
in Durham or Asheville—and I had to look after them, and I just simply
told them that I wouldn't allow it, because it didn't concern me and it
didn't concern them. They did wrong to come in home with great big tales
about how they got punished at school thinking I'd take up for them, be-
cause I knew the teacher wouldn't have punished them if they hadn't done
wrong.
And another rule I laid down up till they was sixteen or eighteen years
old was that if they wasn't back by a certain time when they went out at
night, I'd come after them. And I did. But they usually marched in. Up till
they were sixteen, they had to be in by 9:30, and not later either. I guess I
was a little too strict on them. I always tried to be kind to them, and under-
standing, but 1 had certain hours for them to get in.
[Now I didn't force things on them like religion, though.] My parents
didn't force it on us to go to church, but they took us to church. I know we
never missed church, but we went willingly because we liked to go with
them. I don't think anything should be forced on anybody because in time
they will get tired of it and rebel against it. When I was raising my own
children, we took them to church and they never rebelled against it. They
never said anything against it. But I didn't push it on them. They just natu-
rally went.
CHARLIE: I don't think that it's a good idea to force a kid or a man or a
woman to do certain things. In fact, we had one college teacher over here
that expressed it to me once in a way that suited me: if a [student] is not

interested enough in getting an education, turn him loose. Let him do as he
absolutely pleases. If he don't want an education, let him go. Don't force
him. I still feel like he did.
And I don't think religion should be forced on anybody because that is
the main thing that caused them to leave the old country on account of they
could be free here. Now we have a tendency—you and I and her and all of
us—to feel the church you belong to, that's all the church there is. We have
a tendency to feel that way, but it's the wrong idea. Let me tell you some-
thing that is really funny to me now. My daddy and mammy were
Democrats and Baptists. They raised me with the idea that nobody went to
heaven but a Democrat or a Baptist. That's how strong I was raised. But
now I'm a Methodist and she is a Methodist. Now when I got up and got
out in the world, I had to throw all of that away. Now you just remember
this: I don't believe there is any kind of religious organization that tries to
be good but what there's good people in it, be it a Catholic, Methodist,
Presbyterian, or whatever. You'll find good men and good women in all of
them. So I think it should be on his own hook. When she joined the Meth-
odist church, I went with her. Now I don't believe in being a Democrat

Charlie remembered meeting Tedra Harmon when he was working on the
church in Tedra's community. When he found we were going to visit Tedra to see

he could come along. We welcomed him, and had one of the best interviews of the
trip.

today and tomorrow a Republican, and I don't believe in being a Method-
ist today and tomorrow a Baptist. But I'm a Methodist now and I'm glad
we stayed there. If the time was to ever come to go to forcing us like before,
I think we'd have a regular war right between us. I don't believe in forcing
for anything.
[And that's the way we raised our children. Now we've criticized the
young people today some. Thinking about it, though, and about all you all
have to deal with], I just don't know but what the younger generation is
doing a pretty good job of it. We have a lot of jack-leg preachers that get
up—what I mean by jack-leg is ones that's just about ready to start out.
They've got to criticizing that all the kids are going to the bow-wows and
they're going to the devil and all such stuff as that. Now according to the
number [of bad ones] we had when I was a boy, you could almost pick out
the worst gang [of young people] we've got now and it would be a credit to
us older ones. I'd just like to see it keep on like it is and keep getting a little
better.
ETTA: I think the young people are fine now. I think they're more sincere.
That's what I think about it.
CHARLIE: I'm of the opinion that the younger generation's got just as
much sense as us old fellers had.
ETTA: More.
CHARLIE: That's what I feel about it. 'Course, everyone has their faults.
[When I was out working around], one man had his faults and it would
be one thing, and another man had his. Practically all people has got a
fault. I've got one. You've got one. But people can overcome their faults. I
think Etta will agree with me in that I've done away with a lot of my faults.
I've always been a high-strung fellow, and the truth is, in the community I
was raised in, that made a difference. They was always hard on us. When-
ever they got too tough with me, I could back-cuss just as big as they could.
I'd go right back on it. That's the faults I had. I sort of broke myself of
that. WPA days had a great deal to do with it. But these big construction
jobs that I had to go on—(I say I had to go on them. I reckon I did. I had
to go somewheres to get a job.) I learned a great deal there. I learned that
if you had a lot of men, more than you had jobs for, keep them moving, just
keep them moving around, and there was no fuss about it. I don't
remember on the defense jobs—I never fired a man. I had the authority to
part of the time when I was a foreman, but I never fired a man on all them
big jobs when I had hundreds of men scattered over the area. I was on the
defense job out in the open for four years and then I went into the factory.
I got along with all of them and mostly quit the cussing. [Etta] I think will
agree with me—a lot of the faults that I had when I was young are not

there now; maybe some new ones though. It might be something worse. I
don't think there would be any fault that what if you tried hard enough,
you could overcome it.
ETTA: Like my granddaughter said the other night. She thought an ac-
quaintance of ours felt that the other side had all the faults and they stuck
out like a sore thumb, but that person has faults that were just as bad, or
worse, but they didn't see them. They see them in the other person. You
have to realize your faults before you can get rid of them.
CHARLIE: People now are quite different than what they used to be. In a
way, some are better and some are worse. Young people are just about like
they used to be when I grew up 'cept they're more frank about things, I
think. I think the average-run young people are fine now. At least I hope
they are and I know some fine young people and I'm proud of them. We
didn't have too many people when we was being raised up. We've got thou-
sands and thousands now where we didn't have a hundred then. But the
younger generation in most ways is far different than when I was coming
up. The boys and girls (we'll put it that way, because you've got to be a boy
first or a girl first), they are more outspoken; they are more plain. In other
words, if you do something that we thought back then was wrong, it's open.
But back when I was coming up, the young folks and the old folks, too, was
the same way. They was more sneaky then than the generation is now. You
can go along out here with a crowd of girls and boys, and they get into
something that they oughtn't to but you could line them all up and ask,
"How many was into that?" and there wouldn't be a one of them that
would lie. There might be some of them that would keep their mouth shut
until they had to talk, but they're praying. You ain't going out here and do
something that you oughtn't to, be sneaking about it. You own up to it. In
fact, you want to try to be plain spoken and do just what you think's right.
You might do something wrong, but you don't do it intentionally. But now,
when I was agrowing up, us boys (and our fathers and mothers were just as
sneaking as we was) was more sneaking than they are now. But back them
days, you didn't know when you got the truth. If something come up
wrong, you just didn't know when you got the truth. I think there's a
difference. Now we have the drugs—that's the greatest fight we've got now.
But so far as otherwise, you young folks is a credit to us old sages back
there. But now you can't get nobody else to tell you that—"Oh, I didn't do
that back then." They were meaner than I was. It's not been too many
years since the preachers would get up, "All the young folks are going to the
'bow-wows,' going to the 'bow-wows.' "
ETTA: In other words, going to the dogs.
CHARLIE: I heared that when I wasn't six years old. And you still hear it

yet from some of the preachers. Maybe I expect too much. Maybe we're not
giving the young folks a chance.
What is your most valuable possession?
CHARLIE: You want me to answer that honest? Right there [pointing to
Mrs. Hartley] is the most valuable thing of anything in my whole married
life.
ETTA: Charlie, you consider your children valuable. I do.
CHARLIE: If I didn't have you, how would I manage the children? Don't
try to tell me that.
Is there something you could have done without in your lifetime?
CHARLIE: I could have done without everything but her, if I'd had to. In
fact, there've been times I've had to do without. For instance, you take
money—there's a great many times I had to do without money and work it
some other way.
When we first started out, me and her, there was a part of the time when
we had to make it without much money and part of the time without any,
but now listen, there would be people we'd work for who couldn't pay you
the money—they'd give an order to the store. We made it that way. I'm
twice or three times old as you. They's no family, no one human being, I
don't think, on this earth that can live without some money—money is the
backbone but the Bible says it's the root of all evil and it is. Money enough
would hire you somebody to go out here and burn your house down; go out
here and shoot you. Enough money, I mean. So money is the root of all evil
and yet we've got to have it. Can't live without it.
Now I lived for years with orders' for the store and go and buy stuff with
orders, but suppose when taxes paying come, then you had to have money.
I can remember when the old people were so hard up—such a little money
—now not [only] my daddy, I'm atalking about all the people. They were
so hard up for a little money that they would even save the pennies. Put
them back in a certain place to pay taxes with. Now that's how scarce and
how hard money was. I said folks my father's age, but also for a while after
me and Etta was married, we practically had to save the money and if we
had something on the farm we could sell, sell that, or if I could get a day's
work and take an order at the store, I had to do it. But your orders to the
store (there's nobody takes them anymore) at that time, they was always
cheated and [the storeowner] took enough off of it where you was hurt. In
other words, if you took an order to the store for a dollar, you got about
seventy-five or eighty cents in goods for that order. If you go in with a dol-
lar in money, they lay the stuff out and you could say, "Well, I ain't gonna
give you that much. I've got the money to pay for it." They couldn't stick

you then because you had the money in your pocket and you could do like
the little boy told his mother, "Do as you damn please then."
ETTA: Well, when we lived on a farm, we raised everything and he
worked away. I raised chickens and had a cow, sometimes two cows, and
hogs and things like that. We raised practically everything we ate. We
raised chickens and I had enough eggs to sell and buy a lot of groceries
with. That's the way we lived over there during the Depression. We were
some of the only people that didn't go on relief on account of (well, there
were several in our neighborhood that didn't) I sold enough eggs and but-
ter to buy a big part of our groceries and then I raised a large garden and
done all our canning and we had chickens to kill and sell if we needed to. I
raised chickens to sell, so we made a pretty good living on the farm over
there even if it was a little rough farming. We raised crops. Had corn and
things like that. Of course, we had to buy flour and sugar and coffee and all
our groceries with the money we got from eggs and chickens. After the chil-
dren got older, they helped me with the work. They would go to school, and
then come home and help me.
CHARLIE: They'd come home from school and usually they'd have to
have a snack; the kids were always starving to death when they'd come
home from school. Get a little snack and then they'd have to get out and
help mother work. Some of them would feed the chickens and some the
hogs.
ETTA: I'd usually do the milking.
CHARLIE: She was usually home with the kids and I was off somewheres,
especially after I lost my leg. I was up somewhere where I could get a
money job and she was at home being the boss. She made it a rule and I
don't suppose that she ever refused them a snack when they come home.
Then they got out and worked a little unless something else happened.
ETTA: They helped in the garden, and if the school work was finished,
they helped with the canning. We canned six to eight hundred cans, some-
times quarters and sometimes half gallons, of food. It took all that food for
four children going to school. It had to do all winter till it come spring and
garden time again. I enjoyed it and I sometimes think that was the best liv-
ing. I was well enough to work and I didn't have to buy everything like we
do now.
CHARLIE: Now you see a lot of divorces. Well, I don't like it. It's hard to
explain. I think that in some cases probably it's all right, but the average I
think that on each side they should come to an understanding about things,
and then they wouldn't be so many divorces. I'll be honest with you. I abso-
lutely hate divorcing, but we've got two kids that's divorced. But if you
can't get along together without trouble, then that's the only thing you can

do. I don't believe in it, but there's a lot of it being done. There's a lot
of divorces and I know of a great many cases where there's been marriage
and divorce, and both sides afterwards got along just fine and made a good
living. So I guess maybe there's a little ol' fogeyness there in me.
You've been married for sixty-six years and some people would find that
impossible. How have you made it?
ETTA: Remember in this time that it hasn't been all smooth sailing. Oh,
there's never been a couple yet that didn't disagree, but you can work these
disagreements out.
CHARLIE: What in the devil is the trouble with these folks when they
raise a family and grandchildren [and then part]? Whatever in the devil
would be wrong with me and Etta if we were to divorce today at this old
age? If we could live together and raise a family, what's got wrong with us
in our old age? That's a question I can't see through. Now I think it's the
most foolish thing to happen. To think about living together, raising a fam-
ily, after the family's gone, then have to get a divorce and start out hunting
another man and another woman, but we have that happen. Is so-and-so a
little crazy or something? That's the only thing I can figure about it. His
mind must have went off, or his woman one. But you can't—no one person
can run the world. Not even the President can run it by himself. And still
you can't put two Presidents in 'cause you can take where you put two
bosses on the same job and look what'll happen. I've even tried that. Two
bosses can't run a job; two bosses can't run the Presidency.
ETTA: Two bosses can't run a marriage.
CHARLIE: I guess it's not hardly fair for a fellow like me to—maybe it
ain't fair for me to be atalking about it, because I went through all of it ex-
cept the divorce business. We've never even studied about a divorce. We've
had a spat a time or two. [Both he and Mrs. Hartley laugh.] Quarreled a
little, but I guess, I don't believe that we've ever had a quarrel that more
than six or eight words passed but what one or the other cooled down. I
have never slapped her through madness. She has never slapped me. When
we was young, we played together slapping one another. But she said if I
was to ever hit her, she'd kill me. [Laughter.] And I was crazy enough to
believe her.
ETTA: You'd have to knock me cold and then you'd better be outside
when I come to.
CHARLIE: But it has never been a time me and her has felt like fighting.
We've scolded one another and I doubt if there's anybody that's ever lived
sixty-six years together but what's had a few cross words.
ETTA: We've talked things over.

============================================================
PAGE 45

FOXFIRE 4
CHARLIE: I believe I'll tell you the worst spat—the worst feelings I've
ever had with her. The worst spat we ever had—during the WPA days. I
was so miserable hardup, but I had got money enough and got ahead
enough till I was able to buy a car. I had a good "39 car. [Our son] was the
restless type and you can tell I'm restless, even and me crippled up—I'm
never still. [He] just absolutely could not be still at home.
ETTA: That's our youngest son.
CHARLIE: Part of that time, I took care of Etta in the daytime and at
night he wanted the car to go acourtin' or somewheres. Well, I felt like I
was too hardup to let him go out and burn gas, but he couldn't see it that
way. Well, one morning I got up and I said, "Etta, don't let [our son] have
the car tonight to run around and burn gas."
When I come in, the car was gone. I said, "Etta, you let the boy take the
car and go off."
She said, "Charlie, he begged so pitiful that I just didn't have the nerve
to tell him he couldn't have it."
[Laughter.] I let myself fly off five or six words, sorta scolding. In a little
bit, I missed Etta and her mother was there with me, too. I said to Granny,
"Where did Etta get to?"
She says, "I don't know. She went out the door. I believe she went up to
the old toilet."
I said, "Go up there and tell her to come to the house." Like I couldn't
of went myself. She went up there and come back and says, "She won't
come."
Then I realized it was my time to go. [Laughter.] I walked up there.
She was settin' there acryin' so badly hurt. And I was just about as bad as
she was, but I hadn't known it. I said, "Darlin', come on and let's go to the
house. You'll take pneumonia fever and die."
She said, "I'm hurt so bad, I don't give a dern if I do take it and die."
I put my arms around her and hugged her up and petted her and said,
"Come on. We'll not fuss about an old car. The damned old car ain't worth
what I've already done to hurt your feelings. Come on, let's go to the
house." I think that's about the worst one we ever had. I've never since that
told her not to let the boy have the car.
Now that's the way I look at it and you kids, when you get married, you
can look at it that way. A little ol' car—you can buy another car. But you
hurt your wife's feelings—you'll never get over that. She'll never get over it
and I'll never get over it. 'Cause I was so dirty to scold her. I'll always
remember that. Now we've scolded one another—one or two words—since,
but we've never had that big a scrap. Now you see how it goes? And we're
still here together.

ETTA AND CHARLIE ROSS HARTLEY

Before concluding the interview, we asked Charlie and Etta if they would
talk to us briefly about what they saw happening with land in the moun-
tains, prices, and so on.
CHARLIE: I can remember when land was five cents an acre. That's
nothing. But on the other hand, what was that land worth? There was four
hundred acres in the old Moss farm, and it sold to one man for an old-
timey Ward rifle and a hound dog. And he wasn't as big a fool as you might
think. He didn"t have nothing to do with, so he couldn't live off that land.
But he could take the rifle and dog along and kill game and have stuff to
live on.
Now, of course, land is worth money, and you'd have to pay a thousand
dollars for a little lot around here. Now it's going for summer homes. Right
up there's a beautiful hill cut out for a man's home. I hated to see that hill
tore up, but that man bought it and paid for it and the law is you can do as
you please with it. When we moved here, there was three or four homes
here. Now it's covered up. I bet we got a million people where we had
fifteen or sixteen then.
And we're throwing money away fast as we get it. I know where there's a
brick house a man built where he went broke building it. It cost too much.
That house went into the hands of the ones that put the money up. Some-
body else is living there now, and they're trying to sell it for sixty thousand
dollars. In my day, I expect I could have built it for ten thousand. But now
all the stuff is so high. Now I wouldn't know how to figure out a building
today to tell you the cost. Money comes in and some people go crazy.
ETTA: I don't approve of these here developers taking a lot of these
mountains and hills and just bulldozing them off. I don't approve of that. I
think they're ruining a lot of places from what God intended them to
be. You take for instance as you go toward Blowing Rock, they have bull-
dozed that hill off and that's an ugly sight. Oh, it's ugly. And that was a
beautiful place. I hate to see these places done that way. I think it should be
left like Nature intended it to be.
CHARLIE: Everybody from away from here wants a place in the moun-
tains now. I could just walk out here and stick a little note up for sale and
sell [this place] maybe that day. But there's a lot of us don't want to do
that. Others, whenever stuff goes to getting up in value, we all get excited.
We [want to ] bore with a bigger auger. But me and Etta, we're not going
to do that. We never have. In place of looking for more expensive things,
we educated our c hildren.
But now almost everybody's got to where its dog eat dog. That's the one
trouble we have now. If a man's got a dollar's worth of stuff to sell, he
ought to sell it for a dollar instead of asking five dollars for it. Now you're

============================================================

having to pay out so much money for nothing that I don't hardly see how
we can fix it. People have just gone crazy. We've got a situation that's got
to get worse or better one. Way back yonder when I was a young man, we
had an old fellow over there on Cove Creek by the name of Bingham.
Pretty good old-fashion doctor. He had a neighbor woman, and one morn-
ing she sent word over to him. "Doctor, won't you come over and see me?
I'm kindly sick this morning."
He walked in, said, "What in the world's wrong with you this morn-
ing, lady?"
She said, "Oh, doctor, I'm asuffering and hurting so bad that I'll have to
get better before I can even die!"
Now that's the way we are now in this country. Prices are so high that
the poor man just can't come out. And now they've even taken farming
away from him [as a way of making a living.]
ETTA: I think they need to improve the conditions that make farming
more attractive. The farmer doesn't get enough for the produce he sells to
have a living and pay for fertilizer and seeds too. He doesn't come out with
enough, and he gets disheartened.
CHARLIE: That's why our young people are all leaving. Our family—the
boys and all had to scatter out to get a job. There was absolutely nothing to
do here but to go away and hunt a job or starve one. And they had too
much of their daddy and mammy in them to sit down and starve. Now
one's in Rhode Island, one's in California, one's in Florida, and one's down
in North Carolina. He's been over in England and back. There's just noth-
ing for them to do here to make a go of it.
I don't know what we can do, but I guess we'll have to have something
like the WPA for a short time, at least, or let the people that want to stay
here starve to death one. And of course, the more we have to help them, the
more it hits us [through taxes]. But if we have to put him on relief and pay,
it hits us just the same. Whatever way, we're going to have to carry them
through for a while [until we get things fixed]. We've got to try to help
him. You won't sit in your home and see your neighbor over there by you
starve to death will you? Just as long as you've got something, you'll help
him won't you? Well, that's what we've got to do. We've all got to do a lit-
tle extra. People will say, "We're spending too much money. We're spend-
ing too much money." But what's the money for if we don't use it? We've
got to stick out a helping hand.
I admit that I can't help much. I'm broke down. I can't hardly walk
through the house. But if there's a way I can help, I'll do it.
Somehow, we've got to get things fixed.

KNIFE MAKING
I
.really became interested in making
knives after I had made one of my
.own. After completing it, I set out
for ideas for designs by which I could make others. After going to stores and
making copies of some that were in the windows, I began to wonder how
they were made before modern machinery and blacksmithing equipment
was invented.
So I went out and tried to find some people that still knew how to make
knives as they were made fifty years or more ago. By searching, a lot of luck,
and help from good friends like Charlie Ross Hartley in Vilas, North Caro-
lina, I found two people who still made them the old way.
By interviewing Troy Danner and Tedra Harmon, I collected much in-
formation. In the following interviews, I will show the different ways that
these two men make knives. Tedra Harmon had an extraordinary way of
making a kitchen knife: He used sections of the spring from an old windup
phonograph for the blades. Troy Danner, on the other hand, used one of
the oldest methods of all: knife blades broken off from old crosscut saw
blades.
Both ways of making knives were really something to see, and I will try to
show you both in this chapter.
Article, diagrams, and photographs by Tom Carlton.
THE TEDRA HARMON VARIETY
Tedra Harmon has become a good friend since we interviewed him
about the banjos he makes. Since then, we have found that he knows how
to make lots of other things besides banjos. When we found out that he
makes knives, we jumped at the chance to interview him again.
When we started off that morning, it was pretty cold. We went by
Charlie Ross Hartley's house and picked him up to go along on the inter-
view with us. He wanted to go as he remembered working with a man by

that name once when he was helping to build a church for their commu-
nity, and he wanted to see if it was the same man he had known a long time
ago.
When we drove up into Tedra's yard, he and Charlie remembered each
other right away, and they had as good a time visiting together as we did
being there.
Tedra told us that he had made knives since he was a.kid. His father
never made them. It was just a skill that he picked up on his own. He
started out just using whatever metal he could find. If he had to temper it,
he would heat it cherry red and then dunk it into water. He has made
knives out of saw blades before, and he showed us a couple of hunting
knives to prove it. The day we were there, however, lie was using a long
thin strip of metal that he had gotten out of an old phonograph. He was
breaking it into pieces to make the blades for a set of eight kitchen knives.
He had taken the pattern for the knives from an old kitchen knife like the
ones that were used years and years ago.

============================================================
PAGE 50
============================================================

PLATE 12 Now, using a ball pecn
hammer, he pecks the steel until the
curve is removed and it lies flat.
PLATE 13 
Then, using another knife
blade as a pattern, he marks the width
of the blade on the new stock.
PLATE 14 He again clamps the blade
in the vice and breaks it off by striking
it with a hammer so that it is the
proper width.
PLATE 15 
Then he files the ragged
edge smooth.
For handles, he uses black walnut because it doesn't split and it looks so
good. He also told us that he thinks that using copper wire to brad the han-
dles together is better than using rivets because it's easier to work, and when
it's hammered into the handle it swells into the wood and holds better. He
said he had seen a knife once that was held together with wooden pegs, but
he hadn't tried that.
When he makes a knife out of a saw blade, he cuts the saw blade out
with a saber saw, but when he makes one out of a crosscut saw blade, he
breaks it out with a cold chisel just as they used to do, and then shapes it
with a file.
He claims that, like the old knives, the ones he makes will last a lifetime.
The photos and diagrams show you the method he used for the kitchen
knives he made while we were there.

THE TROY DANNER VARIETY
Troy Danner is one of our newest contacts. Friends in North Carolina
told us about him and took us to meet him when we got there. When we ar-
rived at his home, he and his wife met us at the front door, brought us in-
side by the fire, and started handing out apples and oranges. After a long
day, it was really nice to relax with them.
Several people told us that Mr. Danner used to be the best blacksmith in
that part of the country. He used to make just about anything that had to
do with blacksmithing. He finally had to quit, though, because, as he said,
"I just got old and wore out." He said that at one time, he could stand for a
whole day shoeing horses and putting wagon tires on wheels. Once he shod
sixteen horses at his little shop in one day, "and boy you could feel the sweat
run out of you too!"
He has made knives just about all of his life. Most of them he makes just
for his own use and to his own designs. Mostly he makes the blades from
crosscut saws and handsaws. It takes him about a day and a half to com-
plete one, and the last time he sold any he sold them for a dollar and a half
apiece. He says, "Guess I'm getting cheated, but then it's worth a whole lot
to me just to have something to do to pass away the time. Making knives is
just a gift given to me, I guess."
PLATE 30 Troy makes his large kitchen
knives from pieces of crosscut saw blades.
He breaks out a blade-sized chunk of the
saw by striking it a number of times with
a cold chisel and hammer. It takes hours
to break it out.

At this point, his wife interrupted and said, "I wish you could see all the
knives he has made." Then she went into the kitchen and brought out a
handful of some of his knives that she uses in her cooking. There were six or
eight different designs, and they were all beautiful. Troy picked one of them
up and said, "Now you can go to the store and buy yourself a peeling knife,
but you don't have anything after you've bought it. They just don't have
the metal. But some of these knives we've used for fifteen and twenty
years."

THE WILL CAMPBELL VARIETY
PLATE 39 A butcher knife made by Will Campbell, who died several years ago. He
cut the steel using a cold chisel and a hammer. If those tools weren't available, he
would warm the steel slightly and scribe a line on it. With the steel hanging over the
edge of the anvil, the line on the edge, he would hammer along the line until the ex-
cess steel broke off. Like Troy Danner, he usually used old crosscut saw blades for his
supply of knife blades.

WOOD CARVING
O
n the four-by-eight sheet of
| plywood that serves as a desk
in my log house, there sits a
tiny, inch-and-a-half-high wooden rabbit carved out of poplar by some
whittler I never met who scratched his initials, JAM, into its base. It's a
wonderful rabbit; it was given to me here in the mountains when I was very
young by a warm, generous woman named Violet Winterfield, and it is one
of the very few things I have brought with me into my adulthood from
those early days on Betty's Creek.
That rabbit is as appropriate a way as any to begin a section on wood
carving—a craft that has been around for as long as there have been trees
and hands to shape them with. Some of the items fashioned in the moun-
tains were made expressly as gifts. A coon dog whittled by the fire on a
winter night might find itself in a young son's Christmas stocking, for exam-
pie.
Others carve gift or collector items as a means of making a little extra in-
come: wooden bowls, animal figures, mountain characters, or even whole
farmyard scenes complete with miniature barns and farm animals, or man-
ger scenes complete with wise men and sheep and buildings, or mountain
home scenes complete with furniture, fireplaces, and pots and pans. Such
carving was one of the early industries in the Southern Appalachians. Many
of the groups have been written about by Allen H. Eaton in Handicrafts of
the Southern Highlands, a tremendous study originally supported and pub-
lished by the Russell Sage Foundation in 1937 and reissued in 1973 by
Dover. On page 180 of the Dover edition, for example, Eaton writes about
the work done at the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North
Carolina—a school still in existence: "The IXL brand of pocketknife, fa-
miliar to many of us of an earlier generation, has never been put to happier
use than by the farm workers, students, and neighbors of the John C
Campbell Folk School . . . Mrs. Campbell believed that anyone who with
his pocketknife could cut a fence rail in two in a short time or cover a board

surface with sharply incised mountain hieroglyphics without interrupting
his own or anybody else's conversation might, with practice, put that skill
and energy to more satisfactory use . . . (Now) no scene about the Folk
School is more pleasant or characteristic than the young people resting at
lunch time or around the fireplace in the evening whittling away at their
different figures in all stages from the rough wood to the finished object. A
small block from which a mule, a rabbit, a goose, or a rooster is being
whittled fits conveniently and safely in the shirt pocket, and a sharp knife in
another pocket awaits the free moment when whittling can be resumed."
Then, of course, there is the carving or shaping that is either totally prac-
tical (tool handles, spindles for spinning wheels, crow calls, turkey calls,
wooden door latches and hinges, triggers for rabbit boxes), or practical with
decorative touches (toys, butter molds that leave an attractive design in a
pat of butter, ornamentation in some furniture such as church pulpits and
fireboards, inlay in gunstocks, scrolls on the pegheads of a fiddle or dul-
cimer, walking sticks where the imprint of a honeysuckle vine has been
taken advantage of to produce a serpent crawling toward the handle).
Beyond that, there are even such things as religious wall hangings carved
in relief out of two-inch-thick slabs of wood, some fully colored and amaz-
ingly detailed. The variety is just astonishing. In this section, we hint at
some of it, but a book twice this size couldn't show the work of all those
who work in wood just in our state. There are hundreds and hundreds of
such people, each taking delight in seeing a recognizable shape take form
through his own hands, and each celebrating the fact that he can express
his own vigor, individuality, and craftsmanship in this fashion.

CHARLES EARNHARDT, CARVER OF SCENES
Charles Earnhardt whittles both for a living and for pleasure. He started
eleven years ago when a man he met showed him a few tricks of the art and
some good tools to use. He learned the rest by trial and error, and began
selling pieces about seven years ago. The money goes for a good cause; for
years Charles and his wife have been trying to buy back the family farm in
North Carolina. When we first met him, Mr. Jim Hagan, the industrial arts
teacher at Highlands, North Carolina High School, had asked him to visit
his classes for a week to teach his students some of the same tricks he had
been taught. The afternoon that we visited Charles at the high school audi-
torium, he was surrounded by about twenty-five pairs of hands holding
poc ketknives and blocks of wood.
The tools he uses consist of two knives and two small chisels. The blades
of his knives are made from a straight razor and a pair of barber scissors.

Charles' favorite wood is white pine because it is easily accessible and is
easy to work with. White pine should be set aside and cured for at least four
to five months—a year is preferable.
Some of Charles' carvings are shown on the next pages. It took him a lit-
tle over one hundred hours to complete the scene with the man and the
deer. The shop took close to one hundred hours and the kitchen scene about
two hundred hours. He spends five or six hours on each figure that he
reproduces to sell. When he creates a new figure, it takes longer.
Some of the larger, more intricate scenes are not for sale. The dulcimer
maker, for example, is one that Charles wants to keep himself. The other,
smaller figures, however, Charles makes specifically to sell. As the photo-
graphs show, he is incredibly talented.

DOUG SHEPPARD, BIRD CARVER
Imagine a place where the only sounds are a creek in the distance tum-
bling over rocks and birds of all kinds singing around a peaceful three-room
cottage. It seems that someone would be able to carve birds effortlessly in
such surroundings. And thirty-two-year-old Doug Sheppard does make it
look easy. He talked to us about how he started carving birds and what his
dreams and plans are as he shaped a wren from a chunk of basswood.
Doug carves his birds of basswood (or linden, another name for the
tree). Other woods used by carvers are white pine and buckeye. Doug's fa-
ther prefers basswood, and that is what Doug feels has influenced his choice.
Doug paints his birds with water colors. He paints the basic colors on and
after these dry, he "blends" in the other markings, like the red on the
robin's breast and the yellow on the quail's feathers. Finally, he adds mark-
ings like the white around a robin's eyes, or the mask on the cardinal, or the
brown spots on the quail.
Asked why he prefers water colors over oils or acrylics, he said that water

============================================================

colors are easy to work with, mix well, blend with one another easily, and
look more like the natural colors of the birds. He feels that oils and acrylics
are too shiny to be natural looking. The water colors give a flat, soft appear-
ance.

WOOD CARVING

I've been carving birds like this about five years, but I've been around it
all my life. I carved back there when I was a kid—pick up a block of wood
and carve something out. And one time, years ago, I carved a bird out and
that was a pretty good bird—it wasn't bad at all for shape. I painted it,
didn't do a very good job on painting, but my mother got that bird and
kept it. I believe she's still got that bird somewhere. I looked at it not too
long ago and I wasn't at all ashamed of it.
My dad showed me ways to do things when I started carving. I really
didn't learn much from him. He'd tell me something and I wouldn't listen
to him. I was determined to do it my way. A wood carver's going to do it
their own way—no matter what, everybody's going to be different.
When I started out I wasn't any good at all, but they were good enough
to sell. I feel now like they really looked bad, but here lately I'm getting into
it where I really change something every time I carve one and paint it. I
can put something different on it that makes it look better all the time. I
keep learning more about it. As small as it is, there's a whole lot to learn,
believe it or not. When you really get down to carving, you can work on this
one bird right here all day if you wanted to, if you wanted to study it, keep
adding to it, go right on down and cut every feather on it. I haven't had a
chance or the time to do that.
A friend and I have just opened up a shop in Franklin, North Carolina.
It is situated near the square. There are a lot of people who come through
here in the summer who never see stuff like this. And the good thing about
our shop is that they can see me carving like I'm doing before you, and I
can really sell them.
We are calling the shop "Cardinal Crafts." We are just selling our birds
mostly. People seem to think we'll be a success, that this is something people
will want to come see us do and they'll want to buy the birds. If it goes well,
we'll probably keep it open this winter. If I'm down there at the shop, I'll
be carving birds.
I can sell birds. I hope to continue to keep my buyers supplied as well as
selling in my own shop. If there's anything that's any better in my shop, I'll
get more money for it because I'll be putting more time into it. If my buyers
still want my birds and I can make enough for them, I will make them be-
cause they've treated me nice. I'll try to keep my prices the same as they are
now. I'll not go up sky-high on them.
People come to the door and they think if they come in, they've got to
buy something. And I wouldn't drag them in. I don't care if they do or
don't buy something. If they come in and just say that they like it, that's
fine with me. They're welcome to come in and stand here and look.
To tell me just that my stuff is priced too low [would be okay with me].
Most people don't realize it, but a lot of our stuff is priced too cheap. I get

mad when they come in and say that [our prices are] too much. I know
that's not true. I got into it with one lady. She came in here and there was a
bird sitting over there on the shelf, and she said, "How much is that one?"
I said, "Ten dollars."
She said, "Oh, that's too much!"
I just said, "Too bad."
She came back the next day and she was still kind of nipped about it, but
I just told her that that was a good price and she finally did buy it.
I do watch the birds when I can, and I feed them through the winter.
There are so many different kinds flying in here. There's a family of Eastern
bluebirds nesting out there right now [in a little birdhouse on the fence].
Can you hear those catbirds? And I've seen a hummingbird twice already.
There's a family of little phoebes nesting over my bandsaw in that little
workshop out there.
I've seen some indigo buntings here this year—there's lots of them. Last

year I saw cedar waxwings and rose-breasted grosbeaks; I'd never seen a
rose-breasted grosbeak before in my life.
I've got a good pair of binoculars and I have several good books on bird
identification and use them for reference and as models sometimes for my
carvings.
I'm starting to really understand paint now. I understand how to mix the
colors and the blending and what you've got to do to make it look good. I
don't know about distance and dimensions. I've had no art training whatso-
ever, other than what I've just taught myself. It's starting to come to me—
different shadings and paints and how to carve the feathers. There's proba-
bly a lot of terms in art that I don't know. I'm thinking about going to
Western Carolina University this fall and taking a year of art. I'm not inter-
ested in the credit. I just want to go there and learn. I want to be able to
talk to people about the birds when they come into my shop. I'll have a lit-
tle knowledge of art to be able to discuss the birds' features with the cus-
tomers.
I mount my birds on driftwood, because it's about the best thing you
could find. You could go in the woods and cut off stumps and things—
pretty stuff I guess, but you can find driftwood at Fontana that's the pret-
tiest stuff you ever looked at. A person could pick up enough driftwood to
rnake a living around these lakes and sell it. In fact, there's people coming
in here and wanting to buy it.
I' m going to start upping my prices if I'm gonna take time to find real se-
lect pieces of driftwood and carve a hawk, and spend three or four days on

one piece of work. But that's the only reason I'll up my prices, because Fd
have so much into it. That is, if I can find the time and I'm going to take
time. I don't care if people are waiting for me to carve one bird at a time.
I'm just going to take time and do that cause I've got to.
I want to cane one to where it's like a real bird of some kind and be just
as good as these [famous] wildlife artists. They're real good. They paint
every hair or every feather on them. I want to do work like that, and I be-
lieve I can if I can find time. I know it can be done because I've seen it—
out of basswood, too. This guy in Asheville carves them. He does it for a
hobby and he gets ninety dollars for one little bird and I do it for a living.
But I'd sorta like to do it like he does—take my time and really detail one
and carve every feather on it. I've practiced that and I've studied that and
I know I can do it now, or think I can. I can do real fine work.
Having freedom is my idea of being rich. A man spends eighty thousand
dollars on the interior of a building and he keeps going on and on, and I
don't understand that. I mean, why have all that money? What are you
going to do with it? You could get what you want and then quit. Being
rich, to me, is not having to work and getting to sleep late every morning
and not having any bills and not owing anybody anything and having your
own place.
I'm not really interested in making lots of money. I do want enough to
buy me a little piece of land back in the woods, maybe backing up to some
national forest land somewhere, and building me a house like the one de-
scribed in The Foxfire Hook. I had always wondered how a house like that
was built, and then that book came out with the plans in it. I could have
figured it out probably, but this way I know what to do and I'm going to
build me a house like that someday. [I want a cabin built] out of logs. I'm
going to build one one of these days if I ever get a place to build it.
Then I could just sit and carve, because I hope to really get better and
better, where my birds look real. I have a dream of becoming a famous
wildlife artist—who knows?
C. P. LIGON, FOLK ARTIST
One day out of the clear blue sky, Mr. C. P. Ligon of Toccoa brought
some of his carvings to Foxfire for the students at our school to enjoy. This
was the first time he had brought any of his figures up our way as most of
his work is on display closer to his home in Stephens County.
A couple of months later when it was lime to return the carvings, several
of us decided to go along and find out more about Mr. Ligon and his

hobby. We drove into his backyard and knew immediately we'd come to
the right place. His garage and shop area were filled with logs, stumps, and
sticks of all shapes and sizes. There were carved figures resembling totem
poles, rabbits, a seven-foot-tall Ichabod Crane, a small penguin—all kinds
of figures that can be made from odd-shaped pieces of wood.
When we began to talk with him, we found out that he was seventy-five
years old and had begun carving in ig6j after retiring from a roofing busi-
ness. He had never done anything like this before in his life until then. It all
began, he said, one rainy day when he went to town to get some enamel
paint and began painting a picture. He had never had an artist's brush in
his hand before and said he even did a lousy job of painting a house. But he
enjoyed the feeling, and he soon had picked up a hatchet, a handsaw, a
power saw, and some chisels and started on a piece of wood. Soon a rough
figure emerged and he was hooked. Now a steady stream of one-of-a-kind

figures comes from his shop created out of wood he has picked up in the
surrounding woods and knots and odd-shaped chunks people have given to
him. That day he showed us some cypress knots he was going to make
something out of eventually.
The carvings he makes are never sanded down. He doesn't believe in
going to all that trouble. All the things carved by him he describes as, "Junk
for the school children." He feels they enjoy his rough work more than
things that are finished and can't "be touched and played with." In line
with his desire to make things for kids, he refuses to ever sell a piece of his
work. It is made exclusively for donation to, or display by, local groups that
work with young people. Collectors are sent away empty-handed.
I felt as though we had been to a wonderful and peaceful place. Nobody
wanted to leave. We were now beginning to understand why Mr. Ligon
carves the things he does and wants no money for them: He likes what he's
doing and he loves kids—money can't buy those things.

Robert McLanahan, Melissa McGee, and Alison Rutherford.
The first thing I carved after I quit work was an old Indian. I cut down
some apple trees out there, and I said, "I'm going to make me an Indian
out of this thing." I got my power saw and cut them grooves out in his
head. Took a little old handsaw and sawed around the chin, the ears, and
everything. It just come natural. Do you know what's the matter with peo-
ple today? They don't use the talents they've got. And lots of them don't
have the time to. Just like I was. I wanted to educate my children. I never
took a vacation until it was almost time that I quit work. I quit work at
sixty-seven.
I think kids ought to get involved with things like this early. I was work-
ing on that totem pole I put up at the Campfire Girls' Camp in Toccoa,
and one of my grandsons said, "That just don't look right to me."
And I said, "Well, just go ahead and finish it like you want it." That was
Walter's boy, Matt. So he just finished it off. Then the others came—Mark
and Perry and Bryan—and they all worked on it some too. I told them,
"Go to it, boys. You can't make it any rougher than I'm doing."
That totem pole was from a white pine tree that had been in my yard. I
planted that tree. I got it from down here on Lake Rabun from a fellow.
We was up there covering his house. I looked there and saw that little white
pine and I dug it up and took it home. It was planted before 1950 and was
about twenty-five years old. One day there wasn't a cloud in the sky, but
the wind came up and started blowing awful hard. It was on a Thursday,
and I was fixing to go in the house and that tree started giving away and

fell over. I've made a few other little pieces out of it besides the pole. I've
about used it up now.
And the eagle on top of it is made of oak. It came from a tree that was
out in my yard close to the well. I decided to put that eagle on it, and I
made it up at the house while we had the pole lying down. Then when they
wanted to take the pole down to the lake and set it up, they brought a big
truck down there with a lift on it. That's where it's been ever since.
Then I made an Indian for the Stephens County High School and took it
down there and set it out in the hall. They didn't ask me to. I just wanted
to do that. They're the Stephens County Indians, you know.
It sat out there in the hall. The boys came along and wanted souvenirs.
They took the arms and everything off that thing; just left the main body.
That's all they left. So then it was set back in the book stacks or the storage
area. I kept telling them if they'd bring it to me, I'd remodel it. Then you
people from Foxfire came down and brought it home for me. I appreciated
that. Then I remodeled it to what it was when you saw it the other day in

the dining room at the school. I carried it over there and told them I was
bringing him home. I asked where we should put it, and the lady over there
suggested that it be put in the cafeteria, and that's where it's standing now.
The principal over there is a fine man. He's a wonderful person. The stu-
dents respect him all right.
I also made a doll house once. A little girl we know had an older brother
die of leukemia. Her mother asked me, "How about building us a doll
house for her for her birthday?"
I said, "All right. The case like it is, I'll make it." And I got it done on
time. All I charged them for was the material that I had to buy to go in
there—the walls and the ceiling. I made a little bit of furniture to go in
there. And I made little shakes for the roof myself. I worked with it about a
week. I'd go home and think about the next step. It didn't take me long to
make those shingles. I had a two-inch chisel. I got some little two-by-four
blocks from the lumber company. The fellows over there give them to me.
I've done a lot of work for them. I took the little chisel and tapped the little
shakes out of the blocks. If it's a good two-by-four, I can get about twenty-
two shingles out of it, but I usually get about eighteen out of each one.
The little church I made and gave to Young Harris College had little
shingles on it, too. I gave a little church to Reinhardt College, too. Those
are both little log buildings. The first contact I had with Reinhardt was in
1939 when I went up there and covered the girls' dormitory while I was in
the roofing business. Our preacher's wife went to Reinhardt, and I told her
not too long ago that I was going to make her something for her old alma
mater. Me and the preacher took that little church up there. They were so
tickled with it up there. They said, "I'll tell you what we're going to do.
We're building a museum, and that's the first thing that's going in it." You
know, that was a pretty good send-off.
I had about seventeen little children come over to the house from one of
the schools about a week or two ago. They asked if it would be all right to
come. They asked me when they got through looking at all the stuff I've
carved around here, "Can we have a picnic here in the yard?"
I said, "Go right ahead." They got out there and had a big time. They
seen that tree house out there that my grandchildren play in. They played
in there. I have a lot of fun with the children that way. It's great. What I'm
doing it mostly for is to bring it back like this country used to be. Children
didn't used to have anything to make anything with. No tools. The kids al-
ways made their own things—country children did. We'd make wheels out
of most anything. We've had a right smart of little fun with stuff like that.
We like to hunt and fiddle around with the dogs and have a good time. We
really didn't have toys. The first thing I bought for myself was a little old

that knife wouldn't even cut. I just had it just to have a knife.
But now that I'm retired, I do all this stuff for the school children, and
try to get them interested in things like this. If I can get one of them to try
something, they'll understand and maybe enjoy it. I don't try to make noth-
ing fancy like it was out of a store—finished. I make it rough. And they can
understand that. If they go to the store and get something, it's all dolled up.
But this is an incentive for them to do something. They'll try to do some-
thing like this. Something rough like this, they're not afraid to do it. Paint-
ing's the same way.
I've worked with all three grammar schools in Stephens County, and two

drove up there and I asked for the principal. He told me to walk on in his
office. I told him what I had. "Would you like to see what I brought?"
He said, "Are you going to charge me anything for them?"
I said, "No, they don't have to pay me nothing to see the stuff. I'm mak-
ing it for the good of them. Not to make money."
We drove around behind the building there and they took it right on in,
and he said, "We're going to have a break in ten minutes. We'll let all the
children see it."
They brought the first grade in right on up to the sixth grade, and when
they all got through, they brought the little fellows back in which I appreci-
ated. That did me a lot of good for the little fellows to see it.
They had one kid there who had to sit down. He didn't seem to feel so
good. I had the little covered wagon with me, and he got down there and

looked at that, and looked over there at me, and studied that wagon some
more. It was well worth that trip up there for him, even if I'd got throwed
out. He was enjoying it. All those little kids crowded around. They wanted
to know this and that. They wanted to know what it was all about.
My wife has seen what I'm doing for the children and the interest they
have in this stuff, and she likes that. The grandchildren like for me to make
stuff. They take an interest in it. One morning when I was in California on
our trip recently, my granddaughters out there were looking through this
scrapbook of pictures I've got and clippings and stories that have been writ-
ten about my stuff. I told them to take out anything they wanted, and they
about cleaned it out. I didn't care. I wanted them to have those things.
My mother died when I was ten years old, and I loved her greatly. And
my father got hurt about three or four years later at the cotton gin. He was
knocked out of a wagon by a bale of cotton and then run over by the wagon
and hurt. After that, I stayed with my father. He wanted me to wait on
him. He didn't care about the other kids waiting on him because I done the
things just like he wanted them. I learned a lot. I didn't get to go to school,
but I learned a whole lot of what I needed to know. I didn't really have a
childhood like some children do, but I can't complain. The others went to
school. My father took up a lot of my time, and I never regretted a day of
it. That's one reason today I have a whole lot of respect for old people and
kids, too. I enjoy the kids and I enjoy the old people.
LON REID, TOY FURNITURE MAKER
Lon Reid was one of the most exciting chairmakers we ever found. As
such, we featured him in The Foxfire Book. One aspect of his life that we
did not mention at that time, however, is that he was also a fine whittler.
Not wanting to waste anything at all, he took all the scrap wood and white
oak splits left over after making one of his large chairs, and, with his pocket-
knife, turned those scraps into what he called "toy" chairs that were just as
popular as the larger ones. We bought boxes full of them and gave them
away to people who still treasure them today. Many of them went to chil-
dren, and the thought that people he had never met had received his work
pleased Lon enormously.
Though he is dead now, the hundreds of tiny chairs he made in his life-
time survive, and carry his name forward.

WILLIAM FLOWERS, RELIEF SCULPTOR
William Flowers was born and raised in Copper Hill, Tennessee. He now
lives with his wife and three children in College Park, Georgia, outside
Atlanta, where he works the day shift on the assembly line at the Ford
Motor Company. In his spare time, he carves in wood, and, most recently,
in marble. For his woodwork, he says, "I use hand tools: pocket knives, car-
penters' chisels, hammers, mallets—a little bit of everything according to
what size piece I'm carving. I've got a few handmade tools—a few little
sharp blades and things I use. You know, you can't hardly buy them. I
haven't had a day's training, but I could always draw about anything I
wanted to when I was a kid. I never tried any woodwork until about ten
years ago. The first thing I ever did, I was just playing around. I just
mainly wanted to see if I could do it."
The most ambitious works he does are large religious scenes which he
carves in relief out of solid blocks of wood, the figures in almost three-
quarter round, and colors with paints and stains of various shades and mix-
tures. Occasionally, he sells a piece, and buys more materials to work with.
His wife, Cathy, for example, is a mechanic at Curley's Speed Shop—a ga-
rage in College Park that both fixes private automobiles and sponsors dirt
track racers; the owner saw some of Flowers' work and purchased both a
crucifixion and a Garden of Gethsemane.
Although pictures of several of his pieces follow, he has also carved many
things that we don't have pictures of. "I made a tomahawk for my next-
door neighbor. I gave it to him. It's a great big old piece of a hedge bush I
got there beside where I live. I cut it down and carved a snake around it
with its mouth open, and I did some hand painting on the snake and split a
big rock, and split the stick and drove my rock down in it and bound it with
leather. It looks pretty good."
We, however, do have a photograph of work he's doing in his latest pas-
sion: marble. If anything, he enjoys working in it even more than in wood
as he feels he can get more lifelike figures. Recently, for example, he carried
the Garden of Gethsemane in a four-inch-thick slab of marble and placed it
on his father's grave. He hammered it out at home, working on top of a
chest freezer they have on the porch. His next project is so large he's going
to have to do it away from home, however, at the Cowart Monument Shop
just outside College Park. It's subject? A life-size crucifixion in full round
carved out of one solid piece of Alabama marble. "Can't afford to make
much mistakes with a piece of rock like that," he laughs.
If he could establish his work enough to make a living, he would, "Come

DICK HARRISON, WOODWORKER
"I don't like to cut a dogwood unless it will make a good stick and won't
make a good tree. You see, I shake that tree, and it'll shake this way and
it'll come over this way, but it won't go back that way because of this big
main root here. Well, a tree with one big root, it'll never support a good
tree [but it will make a good cane]. If the tree shakes the same on all sides,
that shows you it has a good bunch of brace roots, so I don't cut it—let it
make a good tree."
Trees were important to Dick Harrison. He was a fountain of informa-
tion on wood and things that could be made from wood. He knew how to
make splits, shingles, ax handles, wooden bowls (or bread trays), walking
sticks, wooden planes, and stools. Making things with wood had always
been part of his life. He was born more than eighty-nine years ago, in a

============================================================
PAGE 91

FOXFIRE 4
house built in 1852 by his grandfather. The house was covered with poplar
shingles put on with nails handmade by a blacksmith. Mr. Harrison told us
about a pit saw used by his grandfather for cutting planks. His father had a
shingle mill on their home place and made shingles of oak, poplar, and
pine. He made many of the tools and instruments used on their farm.
When we arrived one day to talk to Mr. Harrison, he had the outline of a
wooden bread tray drawn on top of the stock. He talked to us as he worked.
As he hewed out the inside of the bowl, he was so accurate he split the
guideline in half with his small adze. These bowls were one of his favorite
projects. He made them of birch, butternut, maple, black gum, chestnut,
serviceberry, poplar, sassafras, cherry, dogwood, and apple—the last four
were his favorite for looks. Applewood came out spotted and was beautiful.
He called this "appaloosa."
When he finished a bowl, he painted on a couple of thick coats of a mix-
ture of one-third spirits of turpentine, and two-thirds boiled linseed oil. He
saturated the bowls with it. After that dried, he would sand and wax the
bowl. As far as he knew, not one of his bowls had ever cracked.
Mr. Harrison was known for the unique walking sticks he made and gave
to friends and special guests of the Rotary Club of Highlands, North Caro-
lina. He had been a Rotarian there since 1954, and never missed a meeting.
For these special sticks, he used small trees, vines, and limbs of trees that
seemed to him would make straight, strong canes. When he was a boy, he
noticed that a tender vine such as honeysuckle would grow from right to left
around a tree. He assumed this was due to the rotation of the earth. He
found that certain vines as they wrapped around limbs and small trunks
helped shape interesting spirals in the wood that gave some of his walking
sticks a special character.
All of Mr. Harrison's tools were neatly racked and well-sharpened. He
had made boxlike sheaths for the blades of his adzes. He said that "A sharp
tongue is the only edge that grows keener with constant use."
As he hewed out the bread tray with the carpenter's adze, he told us
some things about scarifying knives, buttons, woodworking, and preachers
quoting him.
"Back during the Civil War, my grandmother used to tell me about using
persimmons for buttons. Buttons were scarce, and they'd take one of those
awls and punch two holes in persimmon seeds and use them for buttons.
"They used the inner bark of dogwood for quinine. All those plantation
owners had to have something for medicine.
"They had what they called a scarifying knife. It was a little bitty ma-
chine. There's a thing up there on the tool rack that reminds me of it. They
had eight little blades in there in a section with the blades about a quarter
of an inch apart, and you pulled this back and you'd cock it just like a gun.

============================================================
PAGE 92

You put it down on a fellow's shoulder where you'd want to scarify him,
and trip that trigger, and those eight little blades would come down there so
deep to get the blood and make him bleed. They used to think bleeding was
the answer to all ills. My daddy had scars up on his shoulders; I've seen
them many times.
"I've had a lot of people quote me. My preacher quoted me from the
pulpit one time. I had carried him in the woods to get some sticks. I'd get
one up [and] it looked like a bunch of roots to him; and I'd say, 'That's a
nice one to have a good handle.' He talked about me seeing the potentiality
of something. Woodwork is when you see something, and see what you can
make out of it, and have enough imagination to see how it will look before
[you make it].
"Take those stools there; every piece has to fit individually, and in each
one I try to get different curves. In fact, I don't feel there's any straight line.
Nature doesn't deal with straight lines. The only thing that I can recall
that's straight is the prisms on crystal rocks like amethyst and things like
that. That's the only thing I know of that's got a few straight lines—every-
thing [else] is a curve. You can't find two leaves on the ground that are
close enough to be exactly alike; they might be similar, but they won't be
identical."
He also told us how to make a wood kiln and how to use it [see Foxfire
3, pages 366-68]. We learned the mistakes that could be made, the work
involved, and the fun.
He left all his tools and work bench to us when he died about two years
ago. He left bowls and canes not finished, and took a lot of knowledge with
him. But he also left the friends he had made, and some of the things he
had learned.
The instructions for making a tray like the ones he made follow. Don't be
afraid to try—he wasn't. Make mistakes, and try again.
Article by Don MacNeil, Tom Carlton, Ray McBride, Scott McKay,
Beverly Justus, and Bit Carver.
Select a good piece of wood at least four or five inches longer than you
want the tray to be. Mr. Harrison uses poplar, maple, cherry, walnut, black
gum, or pine—anything that will split easily. Starting with a froe and mal-
let and ending with a wedge and glut (wooden wedge), split the log into
two pieces through the heart as shown in Plate 87. Don't use the glut unless
you can see all the way through the split.
"Now the ol'timers, we always used the wooden maul to drive our
wedges with. The wedges were iron, but they always used a wooden maul to
drive 'em with because it protected the metal tools we had."
With a hand axe hew off the inside surface of one of the halves. (See The

Foxfire Book, "Tools and Skills," for a description of the maul and glut,
and the proper way to hew a piece of wood.) The half must be hewn so the
top and bottom will have parallel surfaces. In Plate 88, Mr. Harrison meas-
ures down 3 3/4" from the top of the tray and marks for the bottom. "See,
now that three and three-fourths inches doesn't mean anything except in
this particular block. Sometimes it'll be nine or ten inches [when] I'll be
working on a big block."
With the froe, he splits the wood on the line marked. It will run out and
the hewing will have to be finished with an axe. Mr. Harrison says you
could also use a planer if you wished. You might want to tack cleats on the
end of the block and clamp the wood down as shown in Plate 89 to make it
easier to hew.
Mr. Harrison works the top of the block to a uniform width, then hews
the two surfaces. Once that is done, you are ready to mark off the pattern
for the tray, as shown in Plate 90. Mr. Harrison does this mostly by feel for
how the tray will look. In this case, the actual tray had to be shortened be-
cause of the crack visible in the lower right part of Plate 91. You can check
your progress with this photo as you mark out the tray. The distance be-
tween the # 7 lines is not important, but it must be uniform.
First, mark a lengthwise center line (# 1) running the entire length of
the block. In this case the block was 11l/2" wide, so Mr. Harrison came in
from the edge 5 3/4" for the center line.
From one end of the block, measure in about 2" and mark a line (# 2)
perpendicular to the center line. The 2" are for the handle of the tray. You
can leave more or less depending on how far you wish the handles to ex-
tend. The handles won't extend the full 2", naturally, as they will be worked
down.
PLATE 90

============================================================
PAGE 95
============================================================

PLATE 92
Now measure in another 5/8" and draw another line (# 3) parallel to the
one you just drew. This line will indicate the thickness of the tray.
From this line, measure down the block whatever length you wish the in-
side of the tray to be (in this case 16"), and draw a line ( # 4 ) perpen-
dicular to the center line. Measure out another 5/8" and mark again ( # 5 ) .
Mark a center-width line (#6—the one with the circle on it in Plate
91). In this case, you would measure 8" in from either of the inner lines.
Transfer this line to the bottom by the method shown in Plate 92.
Go back to the center line you drew down the length of the block. You
are about to mark out the width of the handle. The lines you see in Plate 93
are marked I 1/4" on each side of the center line for a total width of 2 1/2"'•
Extend the center line down over the edge of the block on both ends so you
can draw a center line on the bottom.
The other lines on the block are what Mr. Harrison uses to develop his
own theory about making the trays. They help him keep up with what he is
doing when he marks the curvature and begins to dig out the bowl. He laid
these off by the width of his square.
On the circled line in Plate 91 you will notice a short mark near the edge
of the block. The mark is 5/8" in from the edge of the block. It is marked in
with dividers (Plate 94) using the point at which lines #1 and #6 inter-
sect as the center.
In Plate 95, Mr. Harrison uses the dividers to begin to mark the arc of
the tray. He tries several radii until he gets one that "pans out," being care-
ful not to mark the wood which will become the handle. Mark with the
dividers until the curve begins to turn toward the center. Finish the curve

with a "French rule," as shown in Plate 91. "I call this my French rule
'cause I get so many curves out of it. There's some more up there I made. I
just bent this piece of green pine and it holds." Mr. Harrison then goes over
the final outline of the bowl with a lead pencil (Plate 96).
You are now ready to begin digging out the bowl of the tray. Mr. Har-
rison uses a small adze called a cooper's adze to do this. Start from the mid-
dle and work slowly outward (Plate 97). Be very careful not to go too deep.

============================================================

If a chip sticks to the blade of your adze, stop and take it off. If you don't,
the chip might make your adze bounce and ruin the tray or cut you. You
must be guided by your feel in this step, so work slowly until the bowl is
roughed out to the point shown in Plate 98. Mr. Harrison then scrapes the
bowl with tools he has made for this purpose; then sands it.
To make the scrapers, use a piece of steel that will hold a temper well,
and flare one end. Bend the flared end down at an angle slightly better than
900 and put an edge on it. After scraping and sanding, put the bowl aside
to dry for two to three weeks.
Now mark the bottom of the tray in the same way you marked the curva-
ture of the top. Mr. Harrison says a 10" (length) bottom was about right
for a 16" tray. Mark 5" from each side of the short center line, and as much
as you want on each side of the long center line. After doing this, turn the
tray over and mark it as shown in Plate 99. The areas marked with an "X"
are to be cut out with a saw. These new outer lines are drawn so they will

run parallel to the arc of the tray as far as possible from the intersection of
the bowl arc and one of the #8 lines. If these lines do not intersect one of
the #7 lines and the edge of the tray at the same point, draw another line
parallel to the #7 lines from the point where the slanting outer line inter-
sects the edge, and carry this to the other side of the bowl so that the two
new lines have the same angle. The inner lines are drawn tangent to the
bowl arc at its intersection with the first #7 line. Continue the outer lines
down the edge, to give you a better idea of the shape, and cut the sections
out with a handsaw. Saw in toward the handle along the angle you've just
marked on the sides of the tray, stopping a little before you reach the han-
dle lines ( # 8 ) . Then split off these pieces of wood. Cut along the inner
lines perpendicular to the top of the tray.
You can now begin to shape the outside of the tray with a chisel. Work
the blocks left at the handles down with the chisels until they are about
1 1/8" thick. Once the tray is roughly shaped, coat it with linseed oil and set
it aside to dry. This may take from two to six weeks, depending on the
weather and the wood, so test it from time to time by feeling to see if the
wood is thoroughly dry.
Plate 100 shows Mr. Harrison marking off the handles. The innermost
line connects the intersections of the arc of the outside of the bowl and the
two lines already drawn for the width of the handle. Drop back from that
line 1J4" for the outer line of the handle. Measure in from the width lines
3/16," and make a mark. Then draw lines as shown in Plate 100. Saw the
handle off at the outer line, leaving the handle 1 1/4" long.

Measure down from the top of handle about 1/4" and make a mark as
shown in Plate 101. The scratch gauge you see shown here makes this an
easy job. Using a rasp, curve the wood from the top of the handle to this
point. Continue the width lines of the handle down the end of the block
(Plate 102). Using a chisel, form the sides of the handle into these lines.
You may want to slope the underside of the handle up as shown in Plate
103. Use a rasp to finish the curves, then sand the handle.
The finish for the tray is your choice. Mr. Harrison used a mixture of lin-
seed oil and turpentine (two parts to one). If you intend to make bread in
it, Mr. Harrison recommends that you rub lard or vegetable oil into the
wood to avoid giving the bread a bad taste.
ALEX MARTIN, WOODEN BOWL MAKER
We went to see Alex Martin after a friend informed us that he made
wooden dough trays, spoons, and rolling pins. We found his house at the
end of a rutted dirt road far back in the hills. Alex was on the back porch of
his little house working on one of the trays when we arrived.
He lives alone, surrounded by a good supply of wood for his work. In his
hard-packed clay yard, we could see large halved logs and wood chips clut-
tered around. The porch was filled with the tools he uses. A well stood in
the yard across from the porch, and in back of the house we could see his
corn patch and his beehives. There was even a combination sawmill/grist-
mill run by an abandoned six-cylinder Chevrolet motor.
Alex is an interesting person. He has done many different things during
his life. He has operated gristmills (one he overhauled during World War
II was so efficient that it could grind a bushel of meal in two and a half
minutes flat); he has filed saws, and made knives out of broken saw blades;

once he even had a syrup mill that he hauled around to make sorghum for
neighbors in the fall (he got a third of the syrup as payment). He has made
ox yokes, and he has made split-rail fences and strung them out across
mountainsides.
And he is full of knowledge of life in the mountains. He knows, for exam-
ple, that the best time to castrate a hog is when the signs are in-the knees
and going down; and that to keep rabbits out of a garden, you can set some
glass jars out with the lids off. The wind blowing over the tops of the jars
makes a sound that scares them off. And he warns you that the best way to
plant is not by putting fertilizer into the rows with the seed, but by putting
the seed in and covering it and then putting the fertilizer on top. That way
birds won't try to go through the fertilizer to get at the seeds.
He's also full of stories. As he worked, he told us many. One of his favor-
ites was the story of a white man who owned a dog with a short tail, and an
Indian who had a long-tailed dog. The short-tailed dog was always outrun-
ning the other, and one day the Indian asked why his dog was always being
outrun. The white man told him that his dog's long tail slowed it down, and
he offered to cut it off. The Indian agreed, so he put the dog's tail on a
stump and cut it off—but too short. The Indian, in alarm, cried, "Too fast,
too fast, by damn!"
The main reason that we went to see him, however, was that we were in-
terested in finding out how to make the bread trays he is famous for (he
sells all he can make through the Georgia Mountain Arts Craft Cooperative
in Tallulah Falls, Georgia). The wood he usually uses is yellow poplar, but
he also likes walnut. He carves the bowls while the wood is still green, and if
the wood starts to crack as it dries out (which rarely happens) he advises
painting a coat of linseed oil on the bowl.
The directions for making one follow. Before we left, we all tried our
hand at it, and profited in that that is one more thing we now know how to
do.

FIDDLE MAKING
w
hen we started the research
on banjo makers that was
published in Foxfire 3, one
thing naturally led to another, and we soon found that we had a list of fid-
dle makers as well. We interviewed three of them, and the results of those
interviews make up this chapter.
One of the men, Harley Thomas, turned up in our own backyard.
Though we had known him and worked with him for years (spinning
wheels, caskets, furniture, mill wheels), we never suspected he made instru-
ments as well. I guess we never asked him. Or he never thought to tell us.
That happens a lot here.
Harvey J. Miller of Greenmountain, North Carolina, found the other
two men for us. One lives near Harvey in the Pigeon Roost Community;
the other lives outside Bakersville.
To introduce this chapter, we all thought that an appropriate beginning
might be the following fine piece of material from a Lawton Brooks inter-
view that we never found an appropriate spot for until now.
They was lots of people I used t'play with. Oh, I have played with Bill
Lamb. Sure have. Me an' Bill played right out here at th'York House. An'
that old man out at Mountain City—his wife an' me always used t'dance—
Hilliard Taylor. They had a little place built, a little dance hall. It's
still there. They had'em on Saturday nights. Sometimes they'd have'em
through the week when big crowds was up. I got t'going out there to'em—
we had some awful good times. We just danced, had some of the best dan-
cin' you ever seen. Now back at home, we had to have our dances in the
houses. Back then they'd give us a dance, some of th'people would. Some
of'em didn't believe in it, didn't want t'have no dances, some of'em. It tick-
led most old folks t'give a dance. Well, they'd give us their biggest room in
the house—they'd clean it all out. Us boys would all go out, y'know, and
get up wood an' stuff ahead of time for the folks t'have good firewood. We

did that, so the old folks could set an' enjoy themselves, so they'd give us an-
other dance. When they gave us one, we'd git up enough wood t'do'em a
month'r'two. Haul it in, put it right where they could get it. They'd just
clear everything out of the way, an' set those old kerosene lights in the
corner, y'know, so we could see—seemed like then I could see as good by
them as I can by electric lights now. An' so we'd have the awfullest dance
you ever seen. An' we'd dance sometimes away long after midnight. Us
boys, we'd get busy for them dances, whether we wanted to work or not.
We'd all go work like the devil t'get t'go play. We'd move everything out of
the room—used whichever room was the biggest. Most times it was
th'dinin' room. The music makers, they'd git right up in one corner. An'
they'd come right around by us, y'see. We had t'bow right up in the corner.
It always fell my luck t'help make the music, an' I didn't git t'dance too
much them days. An' then me an' old Arthur Young—we used t'make lots
of music. We'd go t'hotels down there at Hayesville [North Carolina], big
hotels, the Herbert—they had some big'uns! But just around in the commu-
nity, oh, we'd have two'r'three a week all th'time. We never missed a week
of not having a dance, Saturday especially. An' sometimes two'r'three dur-
ing th'week. We didn't git no pay for that now, without it was—well, what
you'd call a big shot now, he might pitch in fifty cents. They'd set a hat
down if anybody wanted t'donate anything. Lots of'em maybe would put in
a nickel, some of'em a dime, some of'em didn't put in nothin'. Some days
we'd get up a pretty good hatful. Pretty good payday. I have made as high
as fifteen dollars in a night. Back in them days, that was lots of money.
That'd took me fifteen hard days t'work that out, when I made it there
just in a little while.
Me an' Florence lived on that for a long, long time after we was married.
If it hadn't been for that, I don't know what we'd 'a'done. You couldn't git
work then. Back in what they called "Hoover Days." Always said, "He
come in as President, a dollar a day an' a pair of overalls is enough for a
workin' man."
An' that's all they got. An' they's s'many people wanted work, you
couldn't find nobody had any money. People who had money just set down
on it'r'somethin'. They didn't circulate it. So all the way we had any money
in our pockets a'tall was t'go t'them dances an' we'd git a few nickels'r'dol-
lars'r'something. Outside of that, you'd go work for a man—he'd pay you
in corn'r'meat'r'something you could eat. They could pay me in that, but
they didn't have no money t'turn loose.
We had some of the awfullest times you ever seen. And when we broke
up the dance then, we stayed, by gosh, till ever'thing was put back in the
room an' all cleaned up. 'Cause see, it was in a community—we knowed'em
all an' they all knowcd us. The women an' men stayed right around there

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
till we got ever'thing fixed back in the room like they had it. An' then we'd
all go home. It wadn't no time then till they asked if we wanted another
one.
Oh, the old folks did dance! They danced just the same as th'young-
uns. They shore did. They had just as much fun as we had out of it.
You didn't see no little'uns. That's th'reason we had s'much better
dances. They'd just sit back. They didn't git in there t'bother nothin'.
They'd go t'th'house; might be a gang of'em, but they wadn't in there in
th'way. It was a all grown folks' dance. It was nice. I'm a'tellin' you, it was
s'nice, I'd just like for it t'be back an' get t'go to another one'r two like that.
Sometimes they had food cooked t'eat if anybody wanted t'eat anything.
Always kept somethin' in there for'em t'eat on, but they didn't take time
t'eat much; ever'body was too much interested in that dancin'.
We had such a good sober time. You didn't see no drunks, nothin' that
went on out of th'way. Never did see no trouble in a dance in my life till
after I moved here an' got t'going t'these dance halls. Then I seen a
fight'r'two. But back where I was, it was as rough a country as you ever
seen, but ever'thing was sober. They come sober an' they left sober. Because
they knowed if they went wrong, that'd be th'last one that they'd git t'go to,
'cause they knowed them folks wouldn't have nary another one around'em.
They'd say, "Well, if you can't beat that, never be another one at my
house."
They knowed what was comin' up. We all knowed what was comin' up,
so we all stayed straight.
Oh, I do remember the names of some of the songs! We had that old
"Cripple Creek," an' "Free a Little Bird," an' "Down th'Road," an'
"Shout Lou"—that's one they always wanted us t'play. Oh, we had lots
of'em, sister. I just don't remember how many they was, but we had lots
of'em. Used t'be a man could just pick up a fiddle; I could pick anything
he played. I still b'lieve I could. But I just can't do nothing myself, I just
can't git it in m'mind just right, like it oughta be.
The women, they was awful good t'stay an' clean up. Oh, they'd sweep,
sometimes even mop th'house before we left. But anyway, we had a whole
lot nicer times than they have at dances now. I know that. Lots better. You
could take your girl to a dance then, dance all night, then take her home.
When we got married, I had t'make th'music and Florence'd do the dan-
cin'. She couldn't dance with me. Wadn't no point in her just sittin' there,
so she danced. I got hooked to th'music all th'time. We just played square
dance music. I used t'know all the steps. They were all the same as they
have now.
They had the "grapevine twist." Boy, that'd kill you! And the Georgia
"rang tang." We had the same thing they have now. Shore did. Sometimes

somebody'd jump out there an' buck dance a little, anybody who could
buck dance.
Now they have so many more of these doggers an' things, they've
changed the dancin' around. That cloggin' business is different from a
square dance. They kindly of buck dance around, and call it cloggin'. We
used to just kindly skip our feet. The way we done, we played the figgers
[figures], we didn't care about the dancin'. Just do every figger when it
was called, do it like it was supposed t'be done. Then y'never messed up
with your partner.
They always had t'have a extra man t'call [not the fiddler or banjo
picker] all th'time. Earl Anderson was the best man I ever heard t'call.
He run a hardware there in Hayesville. We played the same figgers they
do now, but we done it s'much better than they do now, you ought t'just
see th'difference. I'd just like t'have me about sixteen on the floor like we
used to back then when we used t'dance, an' let you see. We could just
play one whole outfit by ourselves, an' just show you the difference.
We didn't have no special name for our music, but the people didn't
want nothin' but a fiddle an' a banjo. They didn't have no guitars nor
nothin' like that. They said they could dance as good again with just that.
And I'll still argue that with'em. It's a whole lot better—take a man who
can play a banjo an' a fiddle right there, an' you get out there, an' you can
do as good again dancin' as you can with these oV guitars an' these oP
pianers an' things. All that damn noise agoin'—half th'time you can't hear
your figgers—the man a'callin' the music. You take a fiddle an' a banjo, an'
you kin hear ever'thing that man says. Me an' Florence quit when they
started up with all them bands an' things.
THE HARLEY THOMAS VARIETY
Harley Thomas has been one of our favorite contacts for a long time.
During the early years of Foxfire, Harley vitally contributed to our issue on
log cabin building, as he was one of only two people who could show us
how to notch the logs. His demonstration included the detailed intricacies of
the difficult dovetail notch (see The Foxfire Book, pages 66-73). Harley
also showed us how to make a spinning wheel, and his expertise in its con-
struction was something to see (see Foxfire 2, pages 194-95). Harley
agreed to show us how to make a fiddle, but before we relate these instruc-
tions, we would like to tell you a little bit about Harley Thomas.
Harley was born on December 2, 1892, in the Skeener community of
Macon County, North Carolina. Except for a period of eight years during

============================================================
PAGE 107
============================================================

110
FOXFIRE 4
which he lived in Alto, Georgia, Harley has always made his home in
Macon County. He married Fannie Bradley on September 2, 1912.
Harley has made fiddles since the early twenties and he learned how to
make them by observing "old Man Gurley," who lived in Baldwin, Georgia.
Harley has made a total of twelve fiddles during his lifetime and each one
was perfectly crafted. He surprised us all, however, by saying that he could
complete a fiddle from scratch in one week. He has his own sawmill and
carefully selects and cuts his wood for his fiddles. He also uses his sawmill to
cut other wood since he is a skilled woodworker. Harley makes gun cabi-
nets, shelves, and other furniture as well as spinning wheels and fiddles. He
also used to make caskets when there was a demand.
Several older fiddles that Harley has collected over the years hang in his
shop. One he treasures in particular was given to him by Fate Long of the
Betty's Creek community. He clearly remembers how he obtained this
fiddle, and we thought it only proper to give you Harley's account of this
story:
"I bought Fate Long's timber up there on his place and moved a sawmill
in there and I boarded with him. He had that fiddle back there and he
found out I could play a fiddle. He had me playing the fiddle about every
night till bedtime! I didn't have a fiddle at that time and they wanted me
to play down here at a party, and I borrowed his fiddle. I told him I
wanted to borrow it and play it. He said, 'You take that fiddle and you
keep it till I call for it.' He died out and never did call for it and I still got
it. His folks just told me to keep it because he told me to."

two pieces of wood 5/8"X 15"X4 1/4" that are glued side by side lengthwise with
Elmer's Glue. (The fiddle is held together only by glue.) The top is made of spruce to
produce the be* sound. All other parts are made of maple (curly maple is host) ex-
cept the finger board, which is ebony. The diagrams indicate how the top and back
should be shaped, and the areas to be "dug out".

THE GARRETT ARWOOD VARIETY
Garrett Arwood makes his fiddles much the same as Harley Thomas
made those in the preceding section. Garrett, as do most mountain fiddle
makers, chooses spruce for the top (soundboard) because of its good tone
quality. The rest of his instrument is shaped from curly maple which is
selected for its beauty. As soon as the tree is chosen, cut, planed to a 3/4"
thickness, and cured, he begins shaping the top and back using tools and
gauges he manufactures in his shop. Both the top and back are cut from
solid 3/4" planks, unless wood is scarce and large enough pieces can't be
found, in which case Garrett will join two pieces together side by side with
Elmer's Glue (Plates 125-31). The effect in sound is no different, and he
has made fiddles both ways. The strips that Garrett uses for the sides are
cut from curly maple approximately 1/16" thick, and must be cured for at
least a year. He must be careful not to cut them against the grain for they
would most likely split. When properly cured, they are shortened to the cor-
rect length and boiled in water until saturated and thoroughly pliable.
Then he presses the wet strips into shape using his homemade forms as illus-
trated in Plates 133-34. The maple must be left to dry for at least twenty-
four hours while in these molds.
Using such tools as a saber saw, rasp, chisel, and knife, Garrett carves the
neck and scroll, and rasps the edges smooth (Plates 135-36). Because of
the precision required, he drills the holes for the tuning pegs.
The remainder of the job is, for the most part, assembly. With all the
pieces laid out, Garrett begins gluing the neck and back together, and then
concentrates on attaching the dried sides. This must all be clamped and set
to dry overnight. The lining strips and reinforcing blocks are added next,
and everything is sanded to accommodate the top. When snugly fitted, the
top is glued and clamped, as is the finger board (Plates 137—38). The set-
ting of the sound post comes next and must be handled delicately (Plate
139). The bridge, tailpiece, and pegs are the only remaining items to be at-
tached before the final step of either varnishing or staining (Plate 140).
Garrett's fiddles have a tone and feeling all their own. He takes a lot of
pride and enjoyment in the instruments he makes, and many a friend and
neighbor has enjoyed the spirit of Garrett Arwood's fiddles.

THE CLARENCE RATHBONE VARIETY
Clarence Rathbone is another one of the great people that Harvey Miller
introduced us to. He and his family live at the end of a narrow gravel road
near the top of a mountain miles from the closest town, Bakersville. He
made his first fiddle in 1961, and gave it to his son as a present. It's not for
sale. He may make some in the future for sale, but he hasn't decided yet.
For this particular fiddle, the top is made from a 3/4"-thick solid piece of
white spruce (the longer seasoned, the better). The back is a 3/4" "fiddle-
back" or curly maple, chiseled out and seasoned. The top and back are both
inlaid with white hickory strips. The groove for the strips was cut out with a
pocketknife. The strips were placed into boiling water to soften, then placed
into the groove. The sides, he called "ribs," are of cured curly maple 1/16"
thick. He put them into boiling water, then placed them into the forms
until they dried. Once dried, they could be removed and would not lose
shape.

============================================================
PAGE 120
============================================================

The neck/head is one solid piece of curly maple and was carved out with
a pocketknife. The bridge is made of curly maple. The pegs, finger board,
and tailpiece are all made of boxwood, then painted with a coat of black
enamel. Both pegs and tailpiece are inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
To assemble, he glued a 6"-long bass bar on the underside of the top so
that it runs directly under the bass string. Next, he glued the ribs together
and held them with "C" clamps. After that, he put in triangular posts for
added bracing in the corners. Then he glued the lining in and added the
top, back, and neck at the same time and clamped it together.
After he had it set up, Clarence added the sound post under the first
string and directly under the bridge (see Plate 143). He then stained it with
riddle stain, rubbed it in with a rag, and put on two coats of clear lacquer.
Then he added the tailpiece and strings.

THOMAS CAMPBELL,
PLOW-STOCK MAKER
W
e 
met 
Tom 
Campbell
through 
Harvey 
Miller's
generosity, and we're genu-
inely grateful to Harvey for introducing us. Tom was born in 1879. Al-
though he doesn't plow with a horse anymore, he still farms using a push
plow. He raised forty bushels of potatoes this year.
Members of his large family live nearby and are in constant touch, but he
still prefers to live alone, do his own housework, and let his shop keep him
busy. Out of that tiny shop comes a flood of hand-shaped handles for every
tool imaginable, apple-butter stirrers in two sizes, hoes (he rivets a piece of
a crosscut saw blade to the old shank and adds a new handle: "They don't
never wear out."), and plow stocks. He's slowed down a little—he used to
make banjos too (he made them from a solid poplar or white spruce rim, a
groundhog or house-cat hide tacked on for a head, and strings made of cat
gut).
His brother had a blacksmith shop out of which came knives, rifles, grain
cradles, fiddles—and just about anything else.
Tom still doesn't use glasses. "I read the Bible without them. And I read
newspapers, letters, see there [pointing to two twelve-inch high stacks of
mail]. I don't get many! Any that ain't just literature. That's real letters.
From people. Relation people."
Tom Campbell's energy humbles us.

"My daddy was seven year old in the Civil War. That's what he always
told us. He lived a hundred years, eleven months, and ten days. They's just
two of us brothers living. The rest are dead. I was the first born.
"We had a log house. My daddy built it. He was a pretty good carpen-
ter. He'd build weatherboard houses and work every speck of the timber
[by hand]. Just rough lumber, you know. That was before there were saw-

mills. They'd rive boards out of water oak for doors, shutters, and to cover
the house with. My granddaddy did it the same way. They'd block [the tree
trunk] out as wide as you wanted the boards [see The Foxfire Book, page
46]. The old style was three feet long; they'd lap them over six inches. All
that lumber was to hand dress. Then it was to joint—had to gauge it and
joint it—and then all these facings and trimmings to cut; two edges and a
face, you know, to nail up. Had our tools to tongue and groove with, all
that.
'[When they built a log house] they only used a broadaxe and a chopping
axe. That's all they had. And a froe to rive boards with. There was no locks
on the doors. No windows—just holes. They'd cut out [windows] beside
the chimney to give light to the fireplace room. Cooked on the fireplace.

"Families made it hard. It was hard living back then. They was no
money, no jobs, no work, you see. Only just clearing and building fence and
making corn and taters and stuff like that back in these mountains.
"Mother wove blankets. Old Bill Grindstaff used to make looms back
over here where I was born—Greasy Creek. [We had one he made.] And
my grandmother wove cloth to make pants out of and stuff like that. And
Daddy made shoes; got leather and made us shoes. Only got one pair a
winter. He made'em in the fall, you see, and we had to wear them all win-
ter. If we wore'em out, we went barefooted. I've seen a lot of kids bare-
footed and it as cold as whiz. Go to school thataway. Big heavy frosts and
they hadn't got no shoes. One man lived right at us and his children—half
of them—never had a shoe to their foot all winter. They'd go outdoors,
though, and paddle around in the snow. And didn't have no outhouses
then. They wasn't even thought of. People just went to the woods.
"I remember when they wadn't a speck of lamp oil. They had no lamp
oil when I was a boy. Not a match. Had to kindle a fire with a flint. Take
one of these flints, and they was a maple that has what you call the 'punk'
in it. You take that flint and your knife and lay this punk down and you
[strike the back of the closed knife blade against the flint] till it'll spark,
you know. And that punk'll catch the spark and then you blow it and keep
ablowin' it till it flames, and then you add shavings and build you a fire. It'd
just spread right out and burn like whiz, you know. Blow it a little and get a
blaze and pick it up and put it in a fireplace and put you some shavings on
it and first thing you know you had a fire. I see'd my daddy a many a time
get down on his knees and kindle a fire when I was a little boy.
"[For light] he'd go over here in Limestone Cove and take him a sack
and his axe, and he'd hew out these rich pine knots and split'em up into
splinters. Then he'd light one and stick it in the chimney someplace for
light.
"And then another way—Mother would put hog's lard in a pint cup and
twist her a piece of cloth into a wick and push it down in there and light
that wick, and that fire would draw that lard oil right up in that wick.
She'd set that on the table and we'd eat breakfast before daylight.
"Mother's first stove was a number six-step stove. Then they come a
number seven—a bigger one, you know. It's an iron stove up on four legs—
a little flat feller. They's two caps [eyes] down here, and then it raises up a
little and they's two caps up here. They're a good cook stove. They come in
about seventy-five years ago.
"Big Charles Hughes up here, he got him one when they first come in,
you know. And he built a fire in it—had good dry wood—and it got red hot
on top! And his wife was named Till. He said, 'Till, that stove is going to
blow up! Get a bucket of water to throw on it to cool it down.' And he

threw that water on there and busted that stove all to pieces. I know right
where the house was. Been in it a many of a time. Big old log house. That
was before I was married. It ruined his stove. Had to buy him another one.
"I went to school. Had to walk three mile back up on the mountain. Had
that blue back spelling book. But I never learnt to figger none. I didn't
know a thing about arithmetic. But I've learnt someway. You can't figger
[cheat] me out of nothing. I can figger with any of'em. I've got it up here
[tapping head]. Went to school two years off and on, but the school only
went three months [a year] during the winter time. Had to set way back in
the cold. Had a big old log house with a big chimney in one end of it.
When you'd get cold, you'd get up and go to the fire and get warm and go
back and study your lessons. It was so cold you just didn't learn much,
that's all. Couldn't. And we didn't have no teachers back then to amount to
anything.
"And my daddy didn't get no learning neither, but he learnt to read his
Bible, and he preached for about forty years.
"[It was hard to make a living.] I've plowed oxens a many a day when I
was a boy. Hoed corn for twenty-five cents a day. That's the biggest thing
there was [for work] in my younger days. And clearing and building fence
—seven and eight rail fences. See, stock run out at that time in the woods.
You had to fence your fields up where you made your corn and taters and
stuff like that. Had to fence that all up. After they done away with that,
then, you had to turn around and fence your stock in [because of the new
range laws].
"I had thirty to forty head of hogs in the woods after I married. My
mark was a swallow fork in each ear and an underbit in the right. My
neighbor had his marked the same way except the underbit in the left [see
Foxfire 3, page 85]. Had them registered at Bakersville.
"After I married, I built some rock culverts over streams for the railroad.
Then I sawmilled for twenty-five years. They wasn't no mills in this country
till I was a great big boy. First sawmill that ever come here was right down
here in this bottom here. Steam powered. They was lots of women come to
where we'd move into a new section, you know. Why, they'd come and
stand there and watch that engine run an hour at a time. Three or four
or six of'em. They'd never seen one, you know. They'd get a kick out of
that! I worked my way up in the mill. I set block first, then I fired [the
boiler], then I sawed. When the steam would get down—we've had to shut
down many a time to build up steam in the boilers.
"We went from Laurel Forks to Hampton, Tennessee, to Cane River to
Limestone Cove in the Unaka Mountains for seven years to Ripshin County
for two years. I cut thirty-two thousand feet in there one day. We never fell
under twenty-five thousand feet a day. That was a regular day's work. A

man stood there with a rule—a log stick—and measured every one that
went on the carriage. That's all he done.
"The sawing then was big hemlock. Fifteen to sixteen thousand feet in a
log. Had a double rig [so they could take the whole trunk without quarter-
ing it]. Had a gang edger, equalizer, cutoff saw, and all that stuff. When
some of those big ones went through the edger, there'd be four two-by-fours
there to pick up and get out of the way. Had to trim'em, too. Turn'em
around and throw'em on that trimmer.
"I run a big saw. Put twenty-five years in on that. Never done nothing
else, hardly. I'd work a few days on the farm of a fall—come in and pick
off apples and put'em away. We generally put up three or four hundred
bushels of apples every fall. And kept a lot of cattle. My wife and kids
tended to them.
"When we were sawing, we had sawmill camps—boarding houses we
called'em. About a month at a time is the longest I stayed off from home. I
generally went home every weekend. I'd cross those Unakas—I've crossed
that walking a many a night way in the dark. Then after I got across, I still
had three mile down the creek to get home.
"They logged with yokes of cattle. Move the mill up into the mountains
and log to it. Then they got trucks. They'd skid'em, load'em on trucks, and
bring'em to the mill and dump'em off.
"But back then they had no trucks, you know. Didn't know nothing
about'em. No gasoline. We just roughed it."
Thomas Campbell learned how to make plows from his father, who had
a pattern that Simon Harrell, an old Civil War veteran, had given him.
Simon was Tom's father's uncle, and after he returned from the war he
made his living making plows. Those he made, however, were for oxen, and
so they had a shorter foot (see Plate 152 for names of parts) than those
Tom makes. Tom lengthened the foot because when plows made for oxen
were hitched to horses the height of the horse would cause the beam to be
tilted up too high to make it effective.
It takes him two days to make one plow stock. He uses nothing but hand
tools, including a shaving horse. For holes that have to be square, he bores
the holes first with a brace and bit, and then chisels out the remainder and
dresses up the sides with a hammer and chisel. The pegs and crosspieces are
all made of hickory that he air-seasoned for a year or more, but the pieces
they are driven into are always green. As with chair rounds, this is the most
effective means of keeping them from coming loose, because as the green
wood seasons, it shrinks; wherever there is a peg, it shrinks around the peg,
thus gripping it more tightly than would probably be possible otherwise.
The woods he uses are oak for the beam, yellow locust for the foot and

ground.
handle, and hickory for the crosspieces and any pegs (recently he has been
trying metal bolts in place of pegs to see how they will work). He makes the
foot first, then the beam, sloping the surfaces by random with his drawknife
and block plane. Then he makes the remaining parts and pins it all to-
gether. The false coulter is always made of metal. "You see, be a big stout
horse pulling that, you see, and [if you] hit a stone or anything, you'd
break your foot out. Tear it right out. Thisaway, it can't move."
His brother, George, agreed. "I've tore them all to pieces. Have a mule
going pretty pert and hit a root . . ."
The plow point goes on last, completing the job.
Tom is constantly tinkering with the construction to make it a better
plow. The present use of bolts instead of pegs is one example. "I work ev-
erything that I know how or can think about. [Add] something new to get
it to move, you know. And I'm making them to last. These plows someday
will bring a hundred dollars. They'll be in the antique places, you know."
Though Tom has made them for years ("I made about every plow stock
on Pigeon Roost"), he has not become rich. For years he sold them for
three dollars apiece. Now he gets a little more, but probably not what
they're worth. He doesn't seem to require much money, though, and so it
doesn't seem to bother him greatly. Being rooted in the past, his attitude to-
ward most modern conveniences is casual at best. While we were visiting,
for example, one of the relatives who was there noticed that his refrigerator
was unplugged. She pointed it out to him, saying, "If you don't keep your
Frigidaire hooked up now, Thomas, it'll die!"
"I don't care if it does die," he replied. "I don't use it in the winter
noway."
He has, however, been able to save some money. "I got a bank account,"
he says proudly. "I got seven hundred dollars in there!"

One of the relatives who was there heard him. laughed, and then said to
us within clear earshot, "Well! He'll have to get us an awful nice Christmas
present then!"

WOODEN SLEDS
I
.n the Appalachians long before I
was born, mountain farmers made
.sleds to use where their wagons
wouldn't go. Low to the ground, the sleds wouldn't tip over nearly as easily
as wagons; and being narrow, they would fit through tighter places between
trees in the woods. Bob Bennett, our school's work supervisor, found one of
these old sleds rotting away in the woods where someone had abandoned it.
He brought it back to his house and called us over to look at it.
I talked to Tommy Lee Norton and Lake Stiles about the sled, and this is
what they told me:
In our area of the mountains, the runners for such sleds were usually
made out of sourwood (a soft wood that often has a curved place in the
trunk that makes it ideally shaped), the standards out of locust or hickory,
and the benches (the horizontal pieces that go across the runners to hold
the body of the sled up off the ground) out of oak.
There were three kinds of sleds, but they were of basically the same
design, and built of the same materials.
One type was the sled that had four- to five-foot standards drilled into
the runners but no sides or ends. It was used for dragging split-up acid
wood, firewood, fence rails, poles, or long strips of tan bark out of the
woods.
A second variety had lower standards with side pieces nailed to them and
no ends. These were used for dragging heavier loads such as rocks for a
chimney, sand, or dirt. Sometimes a sled of this sort was fixed so that ends
could be slid into place if needed.
Third was the type that had high sideboards and ends and was used for
hauling lighter loads that would slide easily such as corn, fodder, hay,
wheat, grain, etc. Without the sides and ends, the farmer might leave a trail
of corn behind him.
If the sleds were to be used in the woods, the benches were usually
mounted high up so that the body of the sled was well off the ground and

Hughes are brothers who run a self-
sufficient farm in the mountains of
North Carolina. They have always used
a sled of the type Tedra Harmon built
for us, and they still favor it over a
tractor and wagon which might over-
turn on land as steep as theirs is. In the
photos, they bring a load of hay into
their barn.

could be pulled over rocks and stumps without tearing out the bottom.
Sleds used in fields, on the other hand, were lower, their benches resting
directly on the tops of the runners since there was no need to worry about
rocks and stumps.
The sleds would be pulled by a horse, mule, or steer by means of a pull-
ing bar running between the runners at the front. The bar would have a
clevis for a singletree, or a hole drilled in it for a chain or rope.
If the sled was used frequently, the runners might have to be changed as
often as every six or seven months. New ones would be cut and their sides
and tops hewn off square, but the bottoms would be left rounded as they
would wear down anyway through use. A sled that wasn't being used was
turned upside down so the runners could not soak up ground moisture and
would face the sun so they would harden.
Mr. Stiles said, "When a sled is new, if it's been well made, it can sure be
a pretty thing." I can imagine it would be.
Stanley Hicks, one of the banjo makers featured in Foxfire 3, is someone
that we also talked to about sleds. In his section of the mountains, several
hours to the north of us near Sugar Grove, North Carolina, sleds were
sometimes half-soled (a process described later in this chapter) to keep
them from wearing out so quickly. He describes the sleds he remembers
from their farm as follows: "Dad made all of his sleds. And I've made
many of a one. We had one we called a log sled that we logged on, and
then we had a rock sled. And then we had the one that we hauled our hay
and corn and stuff like that. The rock sled, it was down low on the ground
and solid floored across. The log sled only had two crosspieces on it—log
pieces back here and in the front. And the other sled, it was slatted the
other way.
"Made the runners out of sourwood mostly. Or, if we couldn't get sour-
wood, we got ash. Got them where they'd be crooked up, and then we'd
hew them, you know. We didn't half-sole them at the first. That was later.
And we bored them to put the standards in and put crosspieces and that.
"The rock sled would have a solid bed on it, and it was built real low
down so we could roll rocks up off of the ground on it. And it had sides on
it and a front end. Hardly ever had any back end on it so we could roll
rocks on from the back.
"And the other sled was made up higher so we could get it over rocks.
Sometimes have to take a prize, you know, if it got down too low with a
load on it and got on a rock, and prize it off, or lay something under it and
pull it off.
"If you kept it in the dry, it would last. Then sometimes we'd half-sole
them. If the runner got wore down too much, we'd half-sole them. But
they'd last about half of the summer without half-soling.

============================================================
PAGE 134
============================================================

WOODEN SLEDS 
137
"Then when we'd half-sole them, Dad would take and split white oak—
cut a white oak bush and split it open. Then we took a bent piece of metal
and put it over the end of the runner and ran this white oak piece through
it, and then we bent it down to the back of it and then attached it with
pegs. Bore a hole with a bit and drive pegs in it."
We begin this chapter in the book with Tedra Harmon (see Foxfire 3,
pages 61-64 and 134—39), who showed us how to make the variety of sled
that is most common in his part of the mountains around Sugar Grove,
North Carolina. Many of the sleds in that section have runners that are
half-soled to prevent the runners having to be replaced so frequently.
We then conclude the chapter with descriptions of several other varieties
of sleds we were fortunate enough to find. We soon realized, however, that
it would be impossible to document all the variations, for sleds, it seems,
come in as many shapes and sizes as the farmers who made them.
LOY SMITH
THE TEDRA HARMON SLED
Tedra Harmon, one of the banjo makers we featured in Foxfire 3, also
knows how to make sleds. When he found we were interested, he offered
to make us a sled so we could get a series of photographs of the entire
process. It turned out to be a longer job than we had counted on, and
we had to drive the several hundred miles between our school and his
home twice before we finally finished it, but we made it, as you can see
from the following photographs.
I'd like to tell you a little bit more about our visit before we get to the
making of the sled. Once while the other guys were working on the sled, I
took a walk around his land and in his shop. His shop fascinated me. It is
like a small house with a heating stove unit and a kitchen in it. Upstairs
were bedrooms, but 1 didn't want to bother something I shouldn't. I later
found out he and his wife actually did live there until they built their new
house about a hundred yards away. A huge deer hide and deer skin cover
one of the walls of the shop. On another, he has letters ordering banjos, as
well as tools, saw blades, banjos, and pictures. Also he has a rack with deer
hooves turned at a 90° angle holding up some knives he made, and a hat
with a fox head on it. The fox hat is a dark shade of gold and is thick and
fluffy. I found a box of groundhog hides cut in circles ready to put in
banjos. All I could say while looking at his furs, banjos, knives, and things
was, "I wish I had some money." I had some, but not enough to buy all I
wanted. He later sold me a knife he made with the handle made from a
deer hoof.

============================================================
PAGE 135
============================================================

During the middle of our interview, Mrs. Harmon came out and said
"Have you all had any lunch?" Since we hadn't had any, we told her no. A
little while later she came outside and said, "Tedra, bring'em on in." We
stopped what we were doing and went in and our eyes almost popped out
There on the table was a whole lot of good food. Of the food I remember
we had eggs, sausages, fried chicken, fresh creases, bacon mixed with green
beans, homemade biscuits, honey, cake, fresh plums, corn-on-the-cob, milk
and coffee. While we were eating, Mrs. Harmon kept apologizing for not
having enough. When we told her how much we liked the creases, she gave
us about three hundred seeds to plant for ourselves.
When we got through eating, we just talked for a while before going
back to the sled. Tedra started talking about the old-timers: "It's unbe-
lievable to know how well the old people did get along [with almost noth-
ing]. Lots of people might laugh at them, but they wasn't nothing to laugh
at. I've had a lot of folks come by here in the summertime when I was cut-
ting oats with a cradle or mowing grass with a scythe, and they'd stand and
look at that and say, 'Why, anybody can do that.' Well, I'd hand it to them
and they couldn't do one thing. They thought it was easy, but when they
took ahold, they found out different. I have a few times thought that I
could do something the best of anybody and come to find out that another
man could just skin me alive. I learnt to just keep my mouth shut unless I
know what I'm talking about.
"Now sometimes people get so educated they can't see obvious things.
That's another thing that gets me. I was talking to a man once—had a little
toolbox and a handsaw that was too big to go in it. And he says, 'I'll give
some man a five-dollar bill to tell me how to put that saw in that box.'
"I said, 'Gimme a screwdriver and hand me your saw and I'll put it in
for you.' He handed me the saw and a screwdriver, and a crowd just went
to boohooing and laughing. I took the screws out of the handle and
throwed it down there and throwed his saw down in there and said,
'Gimme your five-dollar bill.' And [since] he was so smart—like I didn't
know what I was talking about—I kept the five dollars. I would have give
it back to him if he hadn't acted so smart. But why he couldn't see that al-
ways buffaloed me. When I took that off, he looked like a fool."
When Tedra asked Cheryl if she had one wish, what would it be, Wig
turned around and asked Tedra that same question, and he said, "If I had
just one wish, I'd wish to have my health back when I was eighteen years
old. Then the other things that I want so bad I'd be able to go on and work
and get them. A lot of people you ask about a wish ask for absolute foolish-
ness and stuff that don't make sense. I'll bet not four in a hundred wishes
for a home in heaven. I wish for good health, and then I can go ahead and

get the rest: a home in heaven when I die, a nice home here, and just a
common living. Wouldn't want to be no rich person—I'm honest about it,
wouldn't want it. Live like I am now. I'm satisfied with my life. I don't
want no earthly things much. Lot of people, they want a big fine home
stuck away up in the air. I don't want that.
"If I had the health that I had when I was eighteen, and knew what I
know now, there's lots of stupid things I've done that I wouldn't repeat. If I
had it to go back over, I could correct that and live a better life—a cleaner
life. I've done a lot of stupid, mean things that if I had my life to live over,
you couldn't get me to do at all. I've even abused my body drinking and
stuff like that. And you know yourself they's a lot of people doing that right
now. And this acid, marijuana, dope. Well, you know they're ruining their
body. Just a ruination of it. And God, he didn't make our body to just be
bruised and beat around every way. I think we should take care of it. Be as
particular about taking care of your health as you can. For when you've lost
your health, you've lost it all. And you don't realize that until you come to
that point and see that you haven't got none and can't do nothing. I think
that's the happiest thing that a young person can have is health. If you'd
a'went through the suffering that I did when I went through that opera-
tion, you'd know exactly what I'm talking about. [Tedra had a diseased
section of the main artery in his leg cut out and replaced with a patch.] I
wanted to die and get out of there. Such pain, my mercy. It was awful. But
God tells in His book that He won't put no more pain on you than you can
bear. But, brother, I had a load of it. Now the doctor explained, said, 'Mr.
Harmon, now I'm gonna tell you the facts. Now you're old enough to real-
ize and not get excited now.'
"I said, 'You needn't worry about exciting me.'
"He says, 'I can't tell you how long you'll live, but,' he says, 'I'm hoping
you'll live a long time. But,' he says, 'whenever that artery does come loose
from that patch on either end where I cut it, if I had you on the operating
table I couldn't save you.' Said, 'You're gone.' Said, 'You might live to
breathe two or three breaths.' But said when it come apart, my heart'd just
throw all the blood out on the inside and stop it. He says, 'It'll be an easy
death. I can assure you that. Now don't let that scare you.'
"I said, 'It ain't scared me,' and it ain't. If a doctor would sit right there
and say, 'Tedra, you're gonna die in fifteen minutes,' I'd never even shake
my hand for I'm ready to go. You won't be afraid with the power of God
almighty. He's your protector.
"Now I've seen the time that I guess I'd a'been like a lot of other people.
When I seen death on me, I'd start a'hollering and a'screaming. I've been
in hospitals with people real sick, and someone come in and say, 'Are you

ready to die?' and they'd go to bawling. Well, something's wrong. They're
afraid. They ain't got the faith to stand up and say, 'I'm not afraid to die.'
I don't want to die, but I ain't afraid to!"
Then we got up from the table and went out into the yard and worked
on the sled until dark.

this case) for the pegs that will pin the
half sole into place.
PLATE 180 
Then Tedra carves a sea-
soned half-inch yellow locust peg for
each hole (the holes go through the half
sole 
and 
completely 
through 
the
runner) and drives them in. As the
green half sole seasons, it grips the peg.
The excess peg length is cut off with a
hatchet or saw.

One half sole in place
and the other ready to be set. The half
soles wear out with use, of course, but
are easily replaced. Meanwhile, the
runner itself remains unworn. If kept
dry when not in use, the sled should last
for years.

PLATE 182 
After the other half sole
is set the sled is righted and an oak
floor is added. With the standards re-
placed, it's ready to use. Some farmers
also make a long wood box with high
sides that will fit down between the
standards and rest on the floor. This is
set on the sled when hauling small
rocks, corn, and the like, and is re-
moved when not needed.
Tedra calls his sled a "bench" sled.
There is also a "Yankee" variety held
together with metal rods. He thinks it
got this name when someone from out-
side the community introduced it (see
Plate 183).

(Variation #1) This
sled, made by Tedra years ago, displays
some notable differences from the one he
made for our article. Both the runners and
the half soles are in two pieces, the cross-
pieces on top of the sills are inset, the front
of the sills extends to the runners and are
bolted to them, and the standards run be-
side the blocks rather than through them.

outside Bakersville, North Caro-
lina, is a very simple but very
common variety. The outstanding
features are the crosspiece in
front of the sled which is actually
set into the fronts of the runners
in almost mortise and tenon fash-
ion, and the four one-piece stand-
ards (see diagram). There are
no half soles on the runners.
These runners, like those on so
many mountain sleds, are simply
curved sections from the trunks of
young sourwood trees.

GARDENING
11 my life I had heard talk of, and 
even watched my family make,
a garden. But because I was younger 
and the grocery store was just 
down the road, I never felt that I 
should go out in the hot sun 
and hoe the garden. Suddenly last year the fact that I was going to have 
to plant a garden dawned on me. The first thing that came to my mind 
was, "I don't know anything about a garden." That's when I started working 
on this article.
My first question was why did they plant a garden? Esco Pitts, one of our 
contacts, said, "Then you couldn't just go to the store and buy much stuff, 
'cause they wasn't much stuff to buy. And the people just made their living, 
just got the practice of making their living at home."
And that's just what they did. The women would take care of the vegeta-
ble garden. Mr. Pitts recalled, "My mother would always put one row of 
flowers in the middle of the garden. She took care of them just like she did 
the vegetables."
What did the men do? They took care of the field crops—things like two 
acres of corn or wheat. The corn was saved to take to the mill for their 
cornmeal and the wheat was made into flour. Sometimes they grew cane for 
cane syrup, which could be used in the place of sugar.
Yes! People really did get out and work in the field. And if you got sick 
and couldn't work, you didn't worry about it much because some of the 
folks that lived near would come over and help. Aunt Arie said, "People 
wasn't a'scared of each other, like they are now." All the people far and 
near would gather at one house. They would have a barnraisin' or bean-
stringin' or cornshuckin'. The families would all bring food and after the 
work was done, all would eat and talk. Lawton Brooks said, "We had a 
many a cornshuckin' way back yonder, but no more."
After getting the land ready and planting the seeds came watching it 
grow and keeping the animals out and the bugs off. Finally came the 
harvest. That was the time when everybody worked. They worked not only

to gather it, but to store it for use during the winter. The mother would can 
the vegetables and dry the fruit. The father had to bury the things like pota-
toes and cabbage. He buried them to keep them from freezing. Florence 
Brooks said, "You could go back in the dead of the winter and dig out a 
cabbage and it would be just as good as the day you cut it."
The people raised their pork and beef, so they didn't have to buy much. 
They only bought what they couldn't grow, going to market about twice a 
year. A family would raise enough vegetables to have some left to sell after 
putting up what they needed for the family. Kenny Runion remembered, 
"We loaded up the wagon and it was so far [to market] that we would have 
to camp on the way there or back."
When they sold the vegetables, they would buy their supplies consisting of 
pepper, salt, some seeds, and coffee beans. Mr. Pitts commented, "I've 
woke up many a'morning to the smell of coffee beans roasting on the fire-
place."
After about ten or fifteen interviews I found that I had not only learned 
how to plant a garden, but I had gained a small amount of understanding 
of what life was like thirty or forty years ago.

CLEARING THE LAND
Families in the. mountains generally settled on land that had not been 
previously homesteaded. They, therefore, had to build their homes and 
dear their land for fanning using only simple tools, manpower, and ox-
power. To cut the trees, many of them two and three feet in diameter, they 
had only large two-man crosscut saws and axes. They chose the levelest, 
richest-looking land, and cleared that for their crops. This was very impor-
tant, because those mountaineers were not gardening casually; they were, of 
necessity, farming for their survival.
R. M. DICKERSON: All this country, this bottom land here where we see 
it now, in my father's and mother's day and my grandfather's day, was in a 
swamp. It was growed up in woods. And the first settlers here settled 
around the foot of the hills above the swamp. The swamp was full of water 
and you couldn't do any good down there until it was drained out, so they 
first settled around the edge of the mountains and up on the mountains. 
They cleared the land there and got the logs and built log houses; that's the 
kind of house I was raised in—a log cabin. They built those log cabins out 
of logs that they took off the land they was going to cultivate. They took 
those logs and used this kind of tractor [a horse and sled] and skidded them 
up to where they was going to build a house.
They [sawed] the trees down on th'place and cut'em up. The ones that 
they was going to use, they rolled them over to the side. But they rolled the 
old rough logs and the stuff that was too big for a house log, they rolled that 
up and built'em a fire and burncd'em all up in the brush. Sometimes it 
would take two or three days to burn all the logs. They'd just keep rollin' 
the logs together till they got'om burnt up.
Never thought anything about getting them stumps out. You'd just plow 
around the stump. In the middle there might be some little stumps or rocks 
in the way. Come time to take a big stump, they might lay some loose rocks 
up on it to get them out of the way of the plow or the hoes or maybe a 
stump that wasn't burnt up quite in the pile they would lay it up on the 
stump and let it rot.
MARY CARPENTER: You've seen them big bottoms in the valley. That 
was all in timber once, and that was all cut down. [In order to clear the 
land], they'd go out with their crosscut saw and an axe, and they'd chop 
down the trees and they'd work them into logs if they wanted to build a 
house. If not, they worked them into firewood; saw it and bust it up. Then 
they take the mattock and the shovel and dig the stumps up. It took a long 
time to dig a stump up, but that's [what they had to do]. Sometimes they

fertile bottomland.
dig down to a tap root. That was a root that went straight down, [the 
others spread out] and sometimes they'd be so big that they couldn't hardly 
roll the stump out of the hole. So they'd hitch a mule to it with a chain and 
pull the stump out. Then they'd fill the hole back up.
People would sled rocks off a field. Why, we used to have an old mare 
and we made a sled, and put rocks on it. We'd load that old sled with rocks 
—every one we could put on it, and Oshie Holt would drive the old mare. 
She was a big and mean horse, too, if she wanted to be. And we'd take 
them down in between Grandpa's place and Bleckley's and add them to one 
side of the rock fence. Mr. Bleckley would haul and pack the other side of 
the rock fence. It was down in the valley, just old loose rock out of the field: 
we'd just take a sled load, place them in there, and keep filling the wall up. 
We didn't need any wooden fence; see, there wasn't no cattle grazin' in 
there then, but it was a line marker between their place and Grandpa's.
PREPARING THE SOIL
A man couldn't walk into the general store and buy his fertilizer and lime 
—no such things existed. The people had to provide for the enrichment of 
the soil from what was available on their farms. Every scrap of chicken and 
animal manure that could be collected was put back in the soil. Some folks

made compost piles, and many spread ashes on the ground to sweeten and 
enrich it. They were true organic farmers.
ANNA HOWARD: We'd terrace if we had a really steep place. Sometimes 
you'd have t'do that. You know, the way they'd do that [was to] make a 
ridge right through here, an' they'd put some sage'r'somethin' through 
there, and it'd stay there all th'time, an' th'sage'd hold the edge of the 
ridge.
LON DOVER: Now that new ground with natural soil that's not been dis-
turbed maybe for a hundred years or longer, see it's got everything in there 
it needs. Until you tended it an' got nutrients out of the soil, why we didn't 
have nothin't'do but plant it. When we'd grow stuff till the .ground 
wouldn't make any more, we'd sow grass for th'horses on those bald places. 
HARRY BROWN: We took the manure out of the barn and put it in a 
pen as big as this room. We'd clean out the stalls of the mules, cows, hogs, 
and chickens in the early part of the fall. And then we'd go to the woods 
and get a load of leaves to throw in there. From time to time during the 
winter, we'd mix it up and keep addin' to it till it was time to use it. We

had big sacks we made into big aprons, and we'd go to th'pile and some-
body would fill up our apron and we'd go scatter it around the gardens.
I was raised at Scaley, back in th'mountains, and you'll find that nearly 
ever'body has a different way of farmin'. Our garden, we kep' it special. 
We'd clear it in the spring of th'year, cleared off every little briar, an' took a 
rake an' raked it; then broadcast it with stable manure—tried ('broadcast it 
ever'year. Now farmin' is different—like a broomsage field, we'd burn that 
off, where if we'd had somethin' t'turn it under, see, that'd be just like good 
fertilizer. We didn't know that back then. Land was cheap back then and 
people cleared up new ground nearly ever'year or we'd just leave. 'Course, 
that'uz hard—plowin' with those stumps all around. An' we'd tend that 
every year till it got where it wouldn't make nothin' and then we let it grow 
up. That's th'reason s'much of this mountain land washed away.
We'd try t'plow it th'first year—we'd just go along an' it'd hang up, an' 
we'd take it out and go again an' hang it [the plow] up again—it'uz kinda 
aggravatin'. Some folks just dug holes and planted in the hills th'first year. 
Y'know those sprouts an' briars in that rich dirt'd grow some times six 
inches in one night. You could buy two, three acres of land back then 
cheaper than you could buy a two-hundred-pound sack of fertilizer. My 
daddy bought three hundred acres for less than a dollar an acre! MARY 
CARPENTER: We'd cut those weeds and things all down, then we'd rake 
them to the middle of the garden. Just put them all into rows; one at one 
end, and one at the other end, and one in the middle, then light a fire to 
them. We'd light a cornstalk and keep stickin' it along—it don't make a big 
fire. Just let it burn a little at a time. You know, if it had been burning from 
one end to another it would have made a fairly big fire. It'll just burn up so 
high and go out—just stir around with a fork and make certain it's all out. 
Then we went to plowing with a horse or a mule. LAWTON BROOKS: 
They'd let the old cornstalks and vines and ever'thing rot on the 
ground, and that fall, they'd plow'em under. They usually plowed in 
th'fall or through th'winter, because the freezin'an'-thawin' would break 
up that dirt an'make it s'fine. Made your ground better. It don't have 
clods'r'nothin' in it. You plow it in th'spring of th'year an' it happens t'be 
a little bit damp, you'll have clods in there all year you couldn't bust with a 
durn hoe. I've hoed old cloddy ground when you couldn't do nothin', only 
roll the clods. I despi.se that—just like gettin' in a rock pile. [They used 
ashes for fertilizer.] I've hauled many a'wheelbarrow load of them. They 
used'em kinda like they use lime to sweeten th'soil. An' that's where they get 
their potash. They put that mainly in their vegetable garden, not in 
th'cornfields. Put'em down through th'winter. Every time y'clean out 
th'fireplace, get your ashes and fill up your wheelbarrow and go spread it on 
th'garden.

WILLIE UNDERWOOD: Before we planted, we'd have to plow it; back 
then we'd have to plow it with a mule, 'cause we didn't have any heavy 
equipment—like big harrows and things like that. We used a low gopher 
plow and what we call a single-foot mule and plowed through those things. 
We didn't tear it up too much the first year after it was cleared. We worked 
it then through the summer, and the next year it would be a lot easier, and 
we could do a lot better job plowing because we could break those roots up; 
they died out and started to rot out. And that helps your soil, too. When I 
was growin' up it didn't take too many years for the soil to stop producing a 
good crop; we'd let it grow up in stubble one year and the next year we'd 
plant it in rye and the next year we'd plant it in corn. We rotated then. 
Now a lot of times, we run year after year with the same thing. We put a lot 
more stuff back into the soil than we used to. You grow a lot more in soil if 
you put back in it. Soil builders, you know. They rot in there and make bet-
ter soil.

TOOLS
The tools available for farming in this area fifty to one hundred years ago 
were relatively simple and non-mechanized, except for the wood-burning, 
steam powered grain thresher which people hired out on a shares basis to 
thresh their rye, wheat, and oats. It seems almost every family had a plow, 
shovels, hoes, spades, rakes, and mattocks; but some families had several 
kinds of plows, harrows, a corn planter, and a grain cradle. And then some 
people just made do with what was on hand—Florence Brooks told us that 
since her father didn't have a harrow, he took a big old pile of brush and 
hitched it to the mule and dragged it over the field until it was smooth.
R. M. DICKERSON: Well, people used about the same tools—hoes, rakes, 
mattocks, and a plow—that's about it.
My grandfather used to have a braid hoe. When they come out here to a 
pretty good-sized sprout or grub that they wanted to dig up, they'd use this 
hoe as a mattock and dig it up. And as th'sprouts come out on a stump, 
they could take this old braid hoe and go around th'stump and knock'em 
off. But these ol' light hoes we got now, you'd break the handles out of

them. This one had a good, big, strong handle in it and it was what people 
called a grubbin' hoe. I don't know how come them to be called "braid" un-
less [someone named] Braid invented them.
Now you've seen these single-foot plow stocks that people would lay off a 
row at a time with just one mule to it. Now that was the only kind of a 
plow they had to get the land prepared. After they got the land prepared 
and the rows laid off, they'd have what they called a double-foot that would 
have two feet on it—one plow in front of the other. The front plow would 
be next to the row and a little ahead and this one would come along and go 
along like that and get some of the dirt to the row sort of, and then they'd 
turn around and come back down that row and throw the dirt to the other 
row. Now that'uz what they called a double-foot plow. And that'uz the only 
kind of a plow that they had to cultivate corn with. They had this single-
foot plow that they plowed up the land with and laid off the furrows, and 
then they used this double-foot to cultivate the corn with and to plow up 
the weeds. Then along behind that the children would hoe. Lots of times 
one of those harrows would belong to three or four families. Every family 
didn't have one—couldn't afford it. So they'd work together and when they 
got the land ready, they'd go somewhere to a good neighbor's over there 
and they'd get his harrow maybe and they'd go in together and all [work 
together ].
HARRY BROWN: We didn't have nothin' but a little bull-tongue or single-
foot plow t'plow it with—didn't have tenners back then. They call'em
PLATE 200    A homemade drag harrow with wooden teeth. Drawn behind A lim-

single-foots now, but back sixty years ago they called'em a bull-tongue, be-
cause most everybody plowed with a steer. I can remember seein' one fellow 
plowin' with a plow he made out of a locust tree—just a stick hangin' down 
t'dig up th'ground.
For a long time, hand wooden plows were all we had. Then people began 
t'learn how t'work with iron; they made the plow-shoe out of that. Later 
they had turnin' plows, an' shover or [a] lay-off plow for layin' off rows, an' 
twister plows for hilling your dirt.
MARY CARPENTER: They had a drag harrow that was a big old iron 
thing with bars across it and sharp teeth. They'd put a big rock on there 
and a log and sometimes they'd stand on it, when they'd get in a place that 
was pretty clotty, you know. That'd help to mash it down. And you could 
harrow it when the ground was damp. Why, it'd be as smooth as a lettuce 
bed.
FAYE LONG: Well, they used a horse in those days. We didn't have a 
tractor and we hoed the corn. We planted big fields of corn, and we 
plowed the corn about three or four times. Every time we plowed, we had 
to hoe it, but now we just spray the corn instead of having to hoe it. That 
was a lot of work, having to hoe the corn every time it was plowed. But you 
had to keep the weeds down. We used a single-foot to lay off with, and a 
cultivator to plow with. We used one horse, and hooked it to the cultivator. 
That turned the soil real good and if you could plow it, if your corn was big 
enough, you plowed close to it, throw the fresh dirt from the far side of the

row over to the next. That would cover up a lot of the little weeds that were 
coming, but you still had to cut the big weeds that were in there, and if it 
was a dry season that would kill'em. But if it was rainy, they'd grow right 
back.
PLATE 202 Horse- (or mule-) drawn 
cultivators such as this one are still in 
use.
SEEDS
Everyone saved almost all of their seed, but many people did buy some; 
lettuce and cabbage seed, for example. Gathering and storing seed for next 
year's crops was serious business. A supply of healthy seed assured a family 
that, barring great misfortune, they would be able to make it through the 
next year as they had made it through the last. Precautions were taken to 
insure that the seed would remain safe and dry, as next year's food supply 
depended on that.
ESCO PITTS: I don't reckon there's not much of anything a fellow can 
plant but what he can save th'seed off of. Let'em get ripe on th'stalk or 
vine, get'em up, shell'em out, dry'em, save'em in little pokes or jars. Pepper 
seed, tomato seed, cucumber seed, all kind of bean seeds, all kinds of seeds. 
People used t'never buy seeds. An' people used t'save their onion seeds, too. 
Had th'multiplyin' onions—red button onions—that'd run up an' make 
their buttons on th'stalk. Save th'buttons. We never did save no cabbage 
seed, but you could save your cabbage through the winter, and then set'em 
out in th'spring of th'year. And they'll make you cabbage seed. Beets, the 
same way—save them through the winter, put them out in a row in 
th'spring of th'year, and they'll run up an' make seed. If you leave'em in 
th'ground, they'll make seed th'next spring.  [My daddy]  picked him out

some purty potatoes, and he'd take some hay or somethin', maybe leaves, 
put that in a hole in the ground and put his potatoes on that and put hay 
over them. And rake dirt over it and put a piece of tin over that to keep the 
water out. That was the seed. Now sweet potatoes he couldn't save. He just 
had to buy them.
LON DOVER: You get your seeds from pretty ripe vegetables, put them 
on something and let them dry. Then you take them up and put'em in jars. 
They have to be dried, or you can't keep them through the winter. We'd 
put th'seeds in a jar or a tin can back then. When th'bugs got t'gettin' in, 
people would store their bean seed in a snuff can an' kept enough snuff in 
there t'cover'em up. For tomato seeds, you'd just squeeze the seeds out on a 
cloth, then lay them down somewhere to dry. Then put the cloth up some-
where to save for the next year. The seeds stuck to the cloth. You do the 
same thing for cucumbers, squash, and pumpkin, but you had to let the 
seeds dry before you packed them away. People were more anxious in savin' 
seeds then than we are now, freezing things. That was a big thing. MARY 
CARPENTER: There was nowhere to buy seeds, so we saved them. 
Once we got'em, we kept'em. We'd leave a row of beans in the garden to 
seed for next year, then we'd shell them out when they dried up, and put 
them in a can and put a spoonful of soda in'em and shake it real good. And 
that's your seed for next year. It's the same way with peas.
For corn, when we were shucking it out after it was dried on the ear, 
whenever we found a big pretty ear, we'd throw it in a separate pile to save 
for seed. Even mustard—we'd let one or two grow up and make seed, and 
they'd leave one cabbage stalk to grow up and make seeds. Same way with 
spinach. The pea and bean seeds are the only ones I put soda in—the rest 
I'd just put them up in a cloth bag in a dry place and hang it on a nail 
somewhere.

bean plants in her barn to dry in the fall,

BELLE DRYMAN: We growed our own seed. For sweet potatoes, we'd 
save some from the last year and, in the spring, bed them down. Fix up a 
seed bed, ever how big y'want, and put manure in it. Cover that with dirt 
-—don't mix it in, then put your potatoes pretty close together on top of 
that, and cover'em up with some more dirt. When they start t'sprout, 
watch'em and let those slips get six, eight inches tall, and pull'em off and 
plant'em where y'want your sweet'taters.
SIGNS
It appears that many more people used to plant by the signs of the moon 
than do now. Some may call this practice silly or superstitious, but many 
swear by it. They would no more plant corn under the wrong sign than 
farmers now would plan to cut hay during a rainy spell. We don't know if 
any carefully controlled scientific experiments have been done on planting 
by the signs, but several people have told us that they have conducted their 
own simple experiments and found that the seed planted under the proper 
sign did much, much better than the same kind of seed planted under the 
wrong sign.
LON DOVER: I wouldn't plant nothin' only by th'signs. Now they's lots 
of people that don't believe in that, but I do. I'uz raised that way, and I go 
by it yet. Don't you plant anything till th'moon gets full. Don't plant 
nothin' on th'new moon for it'll grow up high and it won't make nearly as 
much t'eat. Now roastin' ears planted on th'new moon grow small ears 
right up at th'top of th'stalk. An' planted on th'old moon, it makes a bigger 
ear an' kinda falls over. I plant by th'signs or I won't plant at all. Irish po-
tatoes, plant them on th'new moon and they'll grow that [three feet] high 
and they won't make a total failure, but they won't make half as many. The 
old moon [is] any time from the time the moon fulls till it gets its smallest. 
You can plant all the way to the new moon. Plant everything on th'old 
moon. Now mustard or greens, if you plant on the new moon, they'll run 
way up an' won't have much leaves on'em an' they'll go to seed.
I don't know what causes the signs to do what they do. I just plant mine 
like I told you, and I don't know much about how it works. I plant by 
th'signs an' gather when it gets ripe. I learned it from the old folks. If you 
want to make a good yield, you better go by th'signs, I'll tell you that now.
The dark nights is when th'moon is going down, last quarter before it 
news, there's three dark nights before the new moon. My daddy [planted by 
the moon]. I don't know what the signs were, but it was th'moon, a certain 
time he planted his corn, a certain time he planted his watermelon patch. 
Whenever th'signs are in th'arms is the best time t'plant your beans. An'

you shouldn't plant corn when th'signs is in the heart—y'get black spots in 
your grain. There's certain times as th'moon goes down that I won't plant. 
Sometimes as they go down, they'll be maybe in th'bowels an' get in th'legs 
an' feet is a real good time to plant. An old friend of mine—the best potato 
raiser I ever saw—said t'plant your taters when th'signs is in the feet even if 
it's on the new moon. The best time in the world t'make Irish potatoes is 
when th'signs are in the feet. The signs are good from the head down to 
th'heart, then from just below th'bowels on down to th'feet. The signs get 
t'every part of th'body ever'month. They go from the feet back to th'head 
all over again.
HARRIET ECHOLS: [There are certain sigas to plant under], and that is 
on the new of the moon when you have dark nights. When you plant your 
cabbage, plant when the signs are in the head. Now the dark nights is for 
onions and potatoes. The new moon, I believe, is for corn where it won't 
grow so tall—if it's planted on a full moon, see, it grows straight up. You 
sow your plants at different signs, and when you plant your beans the best 
time is to plant'em in the arms. When you set out plants, start with the 
signs in the thighs and you'll have good luck. That's the old-time rule, now, 
and we still go by it. 'Course, I'm old timey myself, you know. My parents 
went by this and I found [usually] the old timer's go by the zodiac signs. 
When the sign is in the bowels, you don't plant because your seed rots. 
ETHEL CORN: An' if you plant beans on th'new of the moon, if y'ever 
like t'raise any, they'll rot an' speck. They'll make good vines, but they'll rot 
and speck. I didn't b'lieve that at one time—then I tried it once. PAULINE 
HENSON: If you want a lot of cucumbers, plant [the seeds] when the 
signs are in the twins.
R. M. DICKERSON: Well, some people'd plant by the signs, 'specially 
beans, but we never did take much stock in plantin' by the signs. A lot of 
people believed in'em and sometimes it worked out and it'd look like thev's 
right; then again maybe it won't. But what most ever'body had to do back 
then when they got their land ready and the time come, they'd plant signs 
or no signs. It's kinda' like Uncle Bob, that lived in this two-story house 
over here. Somebody was asking him one day about plantin' by the moon. 
He said he always planted his down here 'cause it was so far to go to the 
moon to work it that he'd never get it worked.
LIZZIE LOVIN: Mamma planted beans when the signs was in the arms. 
They'd never plant corn when the signs was on the new of the moon; it 
would grow so high you couldn't reach the ears. They planted corn on the 
full moon, and it'd grow short and the ears would be full. And potatoes the 
same way- if you plant them on the new of the moon, they'd make all 
vines and no potatoes. So we'd plant potatoes on dark nights in March or

April. My mamma used to say the moon was just like a man. It changes
every eight days. She'd plant things that grow leafy on the new of the
moon.
ESCO PITTS: You want'a put onions out in March. You can put them
out earlier, but they do better to put them out on a dark moon, for they
make under the ground.
COMMON VEGETABLES
The different kinds of vegetables grown here years ago are still prevalent 
today, with some variations in particular varieties. The Jerusalem ar-
tichoke, which many people used to cultivate, appears to be the main excep-
tion, as it isn't grown very widely here now.
Corn was one of the most important crops—it was a staple for both peo-
ple and all their animals. They ate it fresh on or off the cob; in fresh 
corn cornbread; used it dried to make cornmeal, popcorn, parched corn, 
grits, and hominy; and sprouted it to make moonshine. The fodder {leaves) 
was used dried to feed the animals, and the shucks were made into mats, 
scrub brushes, hats, and various other things.
The vegetables are listed in the general order in which people said they 
planted them, starting with the cool-weather ones in the early spring, and 
going to the warm-weather ones in late spring and through the summer.
Potatoes
R. M. DICKERSON: Usually the first thing they would plant was Irish 
potatoes 'cause they'd stand the cold. We used to plant'em back in Febru-
ary. 'Course they never came up maybe until sometime in March. Then 
you'd have some to eat because more'n'likely you'd eaten up all your pota-
toes that you'd made last fall by that time.
EDNIE BUCHANAN: We always planted potatoes on a dark moon in 
April, but some folk'd plant'em in March or even February. We'd cut the 
potatoes from last year that we saved for seed into a couple pieces each. 
Had to be sure there was two good eyes in each piece. Well, we'd already 
have our rows ready and fertilized with manure, and just plant those pieces. 
LON DOVER: You can plant potatoes real deep. We used to always take 
th'turnin'plow an' lay off for our potatoes an' then cover'em with a ten-
nin'plow, an' that'd ridge'em up.
ADA KELLY: After we planted the potatoes, we'd work'em and ridge the 
soil up some as the vines grew. We found that if we made a small ridge, 
we'd get big potatoes. We always put ashes on our potatoes, and it made 
them grow really well. We'd dig new potatoes around the time the vines

============================================================

were blooming, but wouldn't dig the whole patch until all the vines had 
died down. We'd plow them out—that plow'd run along under the potatoes 
and run'em out on top of the ground. But I guess some people would dig 
them out.
LAWTON BROOKS: [To store] potatoes, we'd dig out a round hole, 
not too far. Then we'd take us a big sack of leaves, put right in th'bottom of 
that hole, pile th'potatoes up. You can pile them up over the level of 
th'ground, then you put some leaves over th'top of them, or straw, an' cover 
that with dirt. You end up with a sort of mound, then when you want some 
potatoes, scratch you out a little hole right down at th'bottom an' them po-
tatoes keep a'walkin' right to you. You can do apples th'same way.
Onions
AUNT ARIE CARPENTER: [The onions were] planted early. We put 
them out in March if it got dry enough. The earlier you get them out, the 
better they do. We always bought onion buttons, and Mommy had some of 
those multiplying onions. A big onion made little onions and a little onion 
made a big one. And we had these little white shallots, as they call'em. Set 
out one and they'd just make a whole big bunch.
V.w

FOXFIRE 4
LON DOVER: If I don't get onions out in March, I might just as well not 
plant. Seems like they never would do no good [if they were put out any 
later]. They do best in a pretty loose, rich dirt, and they need lots of sun-
shine. Sometime along in August when the tops dies down, we'll pick'em 
and spread'em out till th'dirt gets dried off, and they get cured good. You 
can't store them till they've dried and cured. Then we'd put'em in a 
box'r'somethin' and not let'em freeze. Lots of people'ud tie'em in bunches 
an' hang'em up in a dry, cool place.
BELLE DRYMAN: We always raised our own onions. We had what they 
called th'multiplyin' onion back then. [They were biennial because] the first 
year, a little onion would grow into a big onion. Save that big onion till 
next spring, plant it, an' it'd grow into a whole bunch of little onions [each 
of which, when planted next year, would grow into another big onion, and 
so on]. An' we had some that made what we called buttons on the top 
o'th'stalk, where them blooms grow. You save those buttons till next spring 
and pulFem apart and plant'em. Now if you planted the buttons or the lit-
tle multiplyin' onions in the late summer, they wouldn't make too big of 
onions, just green onions.
Lettuce
FLORENCE BROOKS: They did have leaf lettuce; you didn't never see 
a head lettuce. We planted it early, and when it give up, we planted it late. 
It needs cooler weather—we didn't try t'grow it in th'middle of th'summer.

============================================================

Plant it around March if the ground's dry enough. Our seeds—we 
bought'em in th'store.
ESCO PITTS: My mother grew it every year. She had two kinds—leaf let-
tuce and some that made heads. She planted it very early in the spring, 
even before th'frost quit, because lettuce is a hardy plant. She had a corner 
of th'garden where it seemed t'grow better than any other place. Then she 
had lettuce along in her onion rows.
EDNIE BUCHANAN: I just sow my lettuce in sort of a bed. It loves cool 
weather, and once it gets up some, even a freeze don't kill it. It does real 
good where the ground is rich, but now it's something you have to use when 
it's ready, or it will ruin.
Peas
R. M. DICKERSON: [Plant] five or six rows of garden peas. You know 
nothing but a hard freeze'll hurt garden peas. The frost don't bother them, 
and then in May we'll be gettin' peas from th'garden.
LON DOVER: You plant a row of peas on th'new moon, an' cover'em 
up good with dirt, they'll just crawl right on top of that dirt. I go by 
th'calendar; you can see what phase th'moon is in, and where th'signs are. 
I go by th'moon and th'signs.
We had what we call English peas—that's all they called'em back then. 
We'd let th'peas dry an' save'em for seed from year to year.
HARRIET ECHOLS: We'd plant garden peas, also called them English 
peas. You have to plant them early, February or March, because they like 
cool weather. They don't need a real rich soil like, say, corn does, but a 
pretty good soil. They do best if you can stake them up, but you don't have 
to. They're harder to pick if you don't, though.
We also planted crowder peas and black-eyed peas, which are really 
more like a bean in the way they grow. Now they like the warmer weather, 
and you can plant'em in your corn, and they'll climb the corn and you 
pick'em after they're mature and all dry.
Turnips
FLORENCE BROOKS: We raised great big turnips—people don't raise 
turnips like they did then. Old people had great large turnips back then, 
and they had'em all the winter. Lot of times they'd have t'plow those old 
turnips up and push them aside to plant again in the spring. And my father 
went to th'field with a big basket [to gather the cast-aside turnips], and 
we'd put on pots of'em t'cook for the hogs. We used the same turnips for 
greens that we used for the turnips themselves.

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
HARRIET EGHOLS: The turnips, you saw them early in the spring, 
'bout like peas or lettuce. We usually sowed them in late summer, too, to 
have the greens through the fall and winter. Turnips'll grow in a fair soil— 
now if you want the turnips instead of the greens, you have to thin'em out 
some so they'll have room to grow. People used to bury turnips to keep over 
the winter just like they buried potatoes.
ESCO PITTS: The turnips [we grew] was the purple-topped gold. And 
I've seen them get as big as six inches through.
Carrots
EDNIE BUCHANAN: I plant carrots just about the same time I do beets, 
early spring. I dig a little ridge, then sow the seed along in that ridge. They 
do the best in a loose kind of dirt, but it doesn't have to be too rich. HARRIET 
ECHOLS: Carrots like the cool weather—you can plant'em in early 
spring and you can plant'em again in the summer for fall carrots. Now 
y'can't plant'em too deep, because they'll not come up too well, and you 
have t'cover [the seeds] with fine dirt. You have to thin'em good and keep'em 
weeded, too, in order to get big carrots.
Beets
AUNT ARIE: Now I'll tell you when to plant beets . . .  the twenty-sixth, 
twenty-seventh, and twenty-eighth of March. If you plant beets on them 
three days, you'll sure have beets. But you have to keep right after them. If 
you let the weeds get a little bit ahead of you, they're hard to raise. HARRIET 
ECHOLS: Beets should be planted in February—if they're planted later 
and along comes a dry spell in late spring, they may die if they're still real 
small. They like th'cool weather, and want a fairly rich dirt, but nothin' like 
corn. Sometimes they're bad to not germinate, so it's good to sow'em 
pretty thick. You have to thin them out if they're real thick though, or 
they won't make much beet. You can store'em, but they taste the sweetest 
right out of th'garden. 
Mustard
FLORENCE   BROOKS:   We  planted  mustard   [in  March]  about  the 
same time as turnip greens. We mixed th'seed together most of th'time. 
Then we'd plant'em both again along in August an' have late greens. ESCO 
PITTS: You plant your mustard early in th'spring—it can stand frost an' 
it's th'first greens that come in th'spring.

MARINDA BROWN: My mother used to sow mustard from early spring, 
all through the summer. It likes cool weather, but it did all right through 
the summer. We'd eat it into the late fall. It likes a good rich garden soil.
Cabbage
LIZZIE LOVIN: My mother always planted her cabbage seeds in between 
the onions, in certain intervals—she didn't put'em thick, but she put'em 
where there'd be skips in the onions or where she'd pulled out the onions to 
eat. Then she'd have a row of cabbage where the onions was. [Onions, hav-
ing a strong smell, can help in repelling the cabbage moth, which lays eggs 
on the leaves, which turn into cabbage worms which eat the leaves—Ed.] 
ESCO PITTS: Seems to me we grew a Flat Dutch [cabbage] back then. 
The head would get as big as a half a bushel. Cabbage likes a pretty rich 
dirt to grow in, and they need cool weather t'do their best growing—the 
best times are spring and fall, but here in some of these mountains we can 
grow them all summer long. We'd usually plant'em in March. Some folks'd 
plant seeds right in the rows, and some would start'em in a small seed bed 
and then transplant'em into th'rows when they got up about four to six 
inches. Now the early cabbage we'd eat or make into kraut, but the late 
cabbage, we'd dig down a ditch, pull the [mature] cabbage up by the 
roots, and bury them [head down] in the ditch—instead of putting them 
straight up and down, they was slanted up at an angle. We'd cover the 
heads, and leave the roots sticking out. That was the best cabbage you ever 
eat. Any time of the winter you could go out and dig some out. LON 
DOVER: At that time we grew what we called late Flat Dutch 
[cabbage]. I don't believe I've seen any of that lately; it had a big old 
head. And another smaller-headed one called Copenhagen Market. We had 
t'buy our cabbage seed. But if y'take a cabbage that's been buried all win-
ter, and set it out again in the spring, it'll put up a stalk and make seed. 
You've got t'go th'second year t'get cabbage seed.

Corn
LIZZIE LOVIN: Back several years ago, people grew yellow prolific and 
white prolific and Indian corn. The Indian corn, sometimes Dad would 
take it down yonder to the mill [and have it ground] and us kids wouldn't 
eat it because it was too red. We didn't have any sweet corn back then, 
though.
Corn likes a really rich soil, and most of the time, people would put it on 
the newly cleared ground, and plant it there for a couple of years until it 
didn't make good corn anymore.
To harvest the corn we just hitched the mules to the sled and went 
through there and pulled the ears off and leave the stalk standing. But then 
they'd usually fall over before Dad plowed and he'd plow them under. 
Then we'd take the corn and put it in the crib.
R. M. DICKERSON: Our old rule for planting corn back then was the 
last week in April and the first week in May. That was when the ground 
began to get warm enough for the corn to come up. That was as late as you 
could plant that old field corn and it mature in the fall. LON DOVER: Up 
in June, we'd plant a patch of corn, and it'd be in good roastin' ears till 
frost. We'd cut th'stalks off before th'first frost, stick'em down in 
th'ground and shock it. Th'frost wouldn't hurt it and you could pull roastin' 
ears a good while after th'frost. Stick th'stalks down in th'ground, y'know, 
and just shock it up. Make a big year of corn—y'get it in roastin' ears 
what y'want now, but what you don't use for feed or for

bread, you wait till after it comes two'r'three good frosts in th'fall of th'year 
and then y'gather your corn and put it up. They say [the frost] helps t'dry 
th'sap out of th'shuck. I plant corn in March and harvest in fall.
In plantin' corn, you want to cover it, early corn, about that [two 
inches] deep. But now if th'ground's gettin' warm, it's gettin' late, you 
don't cover it deeper than three-quarters inch an' it'll come up quicker. But 
if you plant it too deep, it won't come up.
KENNY RUNION: They've changed from th'old way, and th'best corn I 
ever raised was when I planted it in March and it'd get up an' get frostbit, 
and then it'd come back out. Of course, if it's barely picked up out of 
th'ground, if it bites it down into th'bud, why it won't come out. As long as 
it don't bite it plumb down t'th'ground into that bud, your corn'll come 
out. It'll come out and make th'heavy corn earlier.
HARRY BROWN: To harvest the corn we were going to keep over the 
winter, we waited way late, till after several frosts. That's so the corn would

get good and dry. If it didn't, when you gathered it, it would rot. We'd go 
in an' pick the corn and heap it up, and then somebody would come 
through With a wagon, loading up and carrying it to the barn. Sometimes 
we'd pile it out in the yard, and have a corn-shuckin' with twenty-five to 
thirty men and have a great big dinner.
Sweet potatoes
LAWTON BROOKS: You take y'potatoes for seed, an' you got to fix you 
a good bed, an' keep it where it won't rain in it—keep it covered—and use 
good, rich soil. Plant your seed potatoes, lay'em in there whole, bury em 
side by side till you get your bed full. When they come up, you just slip one 
[sprout] off, an' another'll just come on. Tater'll just be covered up 
with slips. Y'start your bed in th'spring, an' you have t'keep it warm. You 
plant your slips along in June. We always just grew them in a corner of 
th'corn patch close to th'house. You want clay land, not rich soil. Them 
roots have to have hard soil t'push to or they won't make. They'll get real 
long an' not be any bigger than my thumb. You harvest them long about 
frost. Sometimes a frost'U hit'em, an' you cut your vines off. If it rains 
on'em after a frost, they claim th'frost goes in'em, an' causes th'taters t'rot. 
We plowed'em up—they're hard t'dig up without you cuttin' a lot of'em 
diggin'em.
ESCO PITTS: My father always, when he dug his sweet potatoes, let 'em 
dry in th'sunshine. Then he'd bring'em in th'kitchen an' put'em back of 
th'stove. He'd sort out all th'small, long, stringy potatoes that weren't big 
enough to try t'eat, [and he'd save them for seed]. He stored th'sweet pota-
toes over the winter in the smokehouse. Early in the spring of th'year, he'd 
take those little ones and make him a cold frame with a cover to start his 
plants.
Tomatoes
HARRY BROWN: To make seed beds for our tomatoes, we'd burn [or-
ganic] trash in a pile. Then just took a shovel and hoe, and just turned it 
all up, and mixed it all in the ground. Then we'd sow the seeds, and when 
they got up several inches, we'd set'em out in rows.
EDNIE BUCHANAN: I sow the seeds in April and sometimes I sow them 
the first of March, but you can't set them out without keeping them covered 
until the middle of May.
LAWTON BROOKS: People didn't always stake up their t'maters, but 
they do just so much better than when they just crawl over th'ground. Now, 
t'maters is a thing that does best in the new ground—even if you put lots of

173
manure or fertilize to [the old] ground, there's still somethin' about th'new 
ground—they do best in it. The dirt needn't be too rich, but it can't be 
poor neither. And, sun—t'maters need sun or they'll grow taller and taller 
lookin' for light, and not make many t'maters.
ESCO PITTS: I never saw a tomato till I was ten or twelve years old. My 
daddy wouldn't hardly go to the table if there was a tomato on there. He 
said they wasn't a hog would eat'em and he wasn't going to eat'em. To-
mato was something we never saw in our young days.
Peppers
ESCO PITTS: Mother used to grow a lot of hot pepper—we didn't have 
any bell pepper in those days—none of these big sweet peppers. She sowed 
th'seeds right in th'garden usually, but sometimes she'd plant'em in a box 
an' set'em in th'kitchen, an' they'd get up an' then she'd transplant'em. 
Y'got t'wait till frost is over t'plant or set'em out—latter part of April. It 
takes quite a while. They don't start making peppers till July or August. 
She used pepper in her sausage; rubbed pepper on th'cured meat t'keep 
th'flies away. She used it in her relishes, too.
FLORENCE BROOKS: [The peppers were] just like they have now—all 
but th'banana pepper. We had bell pepper and hot pepper. We planted 
them early, about April, I guess. Planted th'seeds right in th'row—didn't 
ever thin'em out because pepper'll make pretty thick.
Okra
ESCO PITTS: We planted okra just as quick as warm weather gets here 
after th'last frost. It can't stand cold weather. Mother sowed'em in th'row; 
then thinned them if they was too thick. She had th'green kind of okra. 
FLORENCE BROOKS: You don't put any in till after frost—I guess 
May. We always put th'seeds in a cup of warm water one night, let'em 
sprout, an' take'em out an' plant'em th'next day. We always made sure we 
put chicken manure around—chicken manure will really make okra. 
Th'okra was just like th'one we have now, an' we used t'have a white okra 
—it's just so pretty and smooth, an' it was good too. Okra takes a while be-
fore it starts bearin', but once it starts bearin', it just keeps growin' taller, 
and keeps bearin' till frost. It's best t'pick it ever'day, when th'pods are 
around four inches long. It gets tougher the longer it grows.
Squash
ESCO PITTS: I don't remember seeing these yellow crookneck squash 
when I was a boy. [My mother]  planted hubbard and butternut squash,

[the kind that can be stored over the winter]. My daddy had a 
smokehouse where he put his meat, and that's where he stored the squash. 
He'd pile them in there and cover them with shucks or sacks to keep them 
from freezing. Squash likes any good garden soil and pretty much sun. It's 
not a hard thing to grow. We'd just plant them in hills, several feet apart, 
and give them room to crawl.
HARRY BROWN: Old people always—any vine, th'tenth day of May 
they called Vine Day—that's when they always planted them—squash, 
Kershaws, and hubbard. Kershaws are pulp-filled an' grow great long, an' 
they're white, have a neck to'em kind of like crookneck squash, only great 
big. They were really good t'fry like sweet potatoes, or slice up an' put but-
ter an' sugar on'em, an' put'em in th'stove an' bake'em.
Cucumbers
ETHEL CORN: You put cucumbers out just as quick as th'danger of 
frost gets over—frost kills'em—along in May, unless you just put out a few 
that you can cover from the frost. Plant'em in hills an' give'em plenty of 
room to crawl.
EDNIE BUCHANAN: We usually plant cucumbers around the tenth of 
May, Vine Day. I just plant them in hills, several seeds to a hill, and they 
just run out on a vine on the ground, and the cucumbers come on the vine. 
Like most everything else, they like a good soil.
Melons
LON DOVER: We'd plant watermelon an' mushmelon—y'always planted 
them th'tenth day of May—Vine Day. I've known that as far back as I can 
remember. Poppy always'd step off about a half a acre that we'd put in wa-
termelons.
EDNIE BUCHANAN: We used to grow whole patches of melons, but 
we didn't have a certain time to plant them, just early enough in the late 
spring or early summer so they'd have enough time to grow. We'd have 
watermelon and cantalopes, and the whole family would come over to eat 
watermelons. We never did sell them, but I think we sold a few cantalopes. 
My husband just loved to raise'em, I don't know why.
MARINDA BROWN: We grew watermelon and mushmelon, which they 
call cantalope, now. We grew them in the field, in good bottom land, be-
cause they like a more sandy soil, not in the garden. We'd plant them in 
hills, and work'em until [the vines] started to run out, then we couldn't 
weed'em any more.

FLORENCE BROOKS: We'd put'em in th'corn planter an' plant it with 
th'corn. An' just let them drop out whenever they wanted to. An' boy, did 
we have pumpkins! Never did plant'em till 'bout th'time blackberries go 
t'bloomin'—that's th'best time. We had a old mule that got scared of a 
pumpkin vine one time, an' tore down 'bout half a field of corn! We raised 
some great big'uns, an' we ate'em in pies, and cooked and fried in grease.
MARINDA BROWN: Pumpkins like a good rich soil, and they seem to 
grow best in cornfields, possibly because of the shade the corn gives them. 
I've planted them just out by themselves, and they don't seem to do as well. 
My parents used to grow the big field pumpkins—we'd store them in the 
shuck pen, buried under the shucks to keep them from freezing. We'd also 
peel, slice, and dry some of them. Those we didn't eat, we'd feed to the cat-
tle and hogs.
Beans
FAYE LONG: We like to plant our first beans on Good Friday, which is 
just before Easter. Some of the time they'll get frostbit, and part of the time 
not. I can keep going with fresh beans all summer, as long as I keep plant-
ing them two weeks apart, until I don't think there'll be enough time for 
them to mature by the first frost in the fall.
FLORENCE BROOKS: There's altogether a difference—people ain't got 
none of th'old-fashioned bean seed they used t'have. The beans ain't near 
as good as they used t'be. We had what we called greasy-black beans—I've 
not seen any of'em in years—little white beans in a white pole bean. 
Th'greasy-black bean, you can either eat the green bean or a dried bean. 
For a dried bean, after they get dry on th'vine, y'pick'em an' put'em in a 
sack an' beat'em out with a stick. The beans fall out of th'pod.
We planted green beans and cornfield beans. We always planted 
th'cornfield full of them, so we'd have beans that'd dry up an' we'd have 
our own soup beans. When they got dried up, we picked'em an' shelled'em 
out. They're th'same as green beans, only we let'em dry. HARRY BROWN: 
We didn't have any half-runners back in those days; we had cornfield 
beans. We'd pick'em after they got large enough. We'd take'em and 
break'em like we were going to cook them, and set down with a big needle 
and string'em on a thread—[called them] leather britches. People didn't 
can so much like they do now.

PLATE 209    Everyone helps when beans come in.
ESCO PITTS: When I was a boy we didn't have bunch beans—they's all 
cornfield beans or running beans. Around the edge of the garden my 
mother planted her butterbeans and what we called October beans, those 
big old red striped beans. And they'd run up those garden palings, and 
they'd be nothin' to bother'em and they'd make all kinds of beans. And out 
in the cornfield we'd plant field beans and they'd run up on the corn and 
they'd just be bushels and bushels of beans out there. We ate [the cornfield 
beans] green as long as the season was open, and what we didn't pick be-
fore the frost, we let dry on the vine.
Fall garden
It was a common practice to take advantage of the cooler weather in 
late summer and fall to grow more cool-weather vegetables. People planted 
the same kinds of things they planted in the early spring, but not as big a 
variety. Collards are included only in this section because they really don't 
taste good until they've been hit by frost, but everything else mentioned here 
was also grown in the spring.
ESCO PITTS: For a fall crop, we planted turnips in September and cab-
bage. Sometimes we'd put out late-multiplying onions in the fall [around 
September] and have onions all winter. We buried th'turnips along with 
th'cabbage t'keep'am through th'winter. Usually, my mother planted [col-
lards] in th'fall of th'year. Latter part of July, first of August, she'd sow a

col lard bed an' when they come up good size t'transplant, she'd have a row 
in th'garden. Collards are not much good till th'frost bites'em—makes'em 
better t'eat.
FLORENCE BROOKS: They planted mustard an' turnip greens; that's 
about all except for late cabbage which they planted before August. They'd 
dig a hole an' store those cabbage. Didn't plant late potatoes—they 
wouldn't make.
Collards you grow like y'grow late cabbage. They taste th'best if it frosts 
on'em before you pick'em—they just have a sweeter taste that way. If yoii 
grow'em like early cabbage, they don't taste right. You can sow your seeds 
[in July] in your rows, or in a bed an' then transplant'em into rows. 
Come the first frosts in October, you can start pickin' the leaves and cookin' 
'em. Y'don't pull the whole plant up at one time, just keep pickin' the 
leaves, and they like cooler weather, so for a time they'll just keep growin' 
more leaves.
HARRY BROWN: My father would take the collards after they got so 
high, and push them over, and put a piece of pine bark and then dirt over 
them. That'd protect the collards and keep them through the winter.
Other farm crops
In addition to the garden vegetables mentioned, people grew other 
things, either for themselves, or for their livestock. These crops occupy a 
separate section because they are not garden vegetables per se, but were 
very important to the overall functioning of the farm as a nearly self-con-
tained unit.
Perennials, herbs, and spices
It was common for a corner or edge of the vegetable garden to be set 
aside for perennials. The herbs and spices (many of which are perennials) 
were often dug from fallow or wooded areas and transplanted into the gar-
den so they'd be close at hand. Plants such as Jerusalem artichokes and 
rhubarb were commonly grown (as vegetables) with the herbs and spices. 
The Jerusalem artichokes form edible tubers under the ground, and if a 
few are left each year, they will sprout and grow up again in the spring. 
Rhubarb grows back each year from the same stock. (We have not in-
cluded another well-known perennial, asparagus, here, because no one we 
spoke to used to grow it.)

seasoning sausage, garlic for flavoring different things, dill for dill pickles, 
and peppermint for flavoring tea. None of these things took much pamper-
ing—all but the dill would come back from the same roots, and that would 
self-sow, and they didn't take a really rich soil. Of course, you had to weed 
them and keep them from spreading too far, especially the garlic.
She also grew rhubarb and Jerusalem artichokes along the edge of the 
garden. The rhubarb she got when a neighbor divided hers. They like a 
rich, well-drained soil, and [the roots] need to be divided every couple of 
years. The Jerusalem artichokes grew in rich soil, too. We liked to eat them 
raw.
FLORENCE BROOKS: Oh, we had [Jerusalem] artichokes. I don't 
know when they planted'em; they was just there when I was. They kept 
coming back, an' we'd just dig'em an' eat, Lord mercy! They were planted 
outside of th'fence—it was good rich soil right below th'garden.
Ever'body had rhubarb. We always set it out by th'garden fence an' let it 
go. Didn't dig it up, just let it grow, year after year. It gets in big bunches. 
Set'em inside th'garden.
ESCO PITTS: My mother had all kinds of [herbs]—rhubarb, rue, 
comirey, Jerusalem oak, mallards, sage, parsley, and catnip. She had in one 
corner of her garden all her medicinal plants, and that corner never was 
plowed up—she was very careful of that. They'd just come up ever'spring. 
The rue she made tea of, and I ain't seen a stock of rue in many a day. She 
used Jerusalem oak to make candy out of for worm medicine. And 
th'mallard leaf was to put on a burn—wilt it in front of th'fire an' slap it 
on a burn an' it would draw th'fire out. The comfrey she used for poultices 
for sores.
ADA KELLY: My mother [had a corner of the garden] where she grew 
dill and sage, catnip, ground ivy—the babies had to have that for tea. And 
she grew tansy and peppermint. Most of them came back year after year, 
but a few, like dill, she had to plant from seed.
Fruit
Many people cultivated fruit in the mountains years ago, with apples, 
peaches, and grapes being the most common. But it appears to us that peo-
ple relied very heavily on the wild fruit which grew in abundance. Some ex-
amples are blackberries, strawberries, huckleberries, persimmons, cherries, 
mulberries, mayapples, and elderberries.
KENNY RUNION: People grew apples, peaches, grapes, plums, and 
pears. And they were delicious. At that time there was no such thing as 
sprayin'. The people in my young life pruned their trees and grape vines in

February, and that was all that was done. And it was delicious fruit. You 
don't get fruit now'days that tastes like that fruit. Now some people had a 
cellar t'put stuff in, but most people just dug holes in th'ground. MARINDA 
BROWN: While I was growing up on Middle Creek, my father had all 
kinds of fruit, and there was no problem with bugs. There were several apple 
trees all around the house and barnyard. He always fertilized them with 
stable manure every year. The kinds I can remember that he grew were 
Shockley, Ben Davis, and Limbertwig. I guess he pruned them, but I really 
can't remember.
He also set out some cherry trees around, but as far as I can recall he 
never pampered them. They just bore every year. There were also some 
currant and some gooseberry bushes that were on the place when Dad 
bought it. He never did anything with them, either. They just bore fruit.
There was a man who used some of our land to start seedlings [to sell] 
on—all kinds of fruit trees. Many of those seeds were carried around by 
the birds, I guess, and we also had self-sowed plum and peach trees all 
around from that. And no one ever took care of them—all we did was pick 
the fruit.
ADA KELLY: We had a nice apple orchard and a peach orchard. We 
called'em Indian peaches, and they were small and about as red as a pick-
led beet. And then we had a small peach we called an openstone, because 
the peach didn't cling to the seed. We had to take care of the orchard— 
mainly, we pruned and fertilized them during the cold months. We'd store 
the apples in a hole dug in the ground. First, we'd put in some hay or straw 
or dry leaves, and pour the apples in. Then, we covered it over with more 
hay or leaves, then heavy soil. They kept all winter.
LON DOVER: We grew grapes and had wild grapes, too. Grapes don't 
take a whole lot of work, and they'll grow in a lot o'different places. We al-
ways gave them a trellis t'grow on, and we'd prune them and put stable 
manure on them every fall or winter. Nothin' much used to bother'em, but 
the Japanese beetles [we have now] are bad to eat the leaves. I've heard 
old folks say about pruning, that if you saw an apple tree limb off on the 
new moon it's guaranteed t'heal—just grows over like skin grows back. If 
y'saw a limb off on th'old moon, th'wood'll generally rot. So, if I have any 
prunin' to do, I'll do it on th'new moon if I can.
Cane
LON DOVER: Many people grew cane. Y'sow your cane and when it 
grows up, it's like corn. When th'seed turns brown, it's ripe. Some people 
cut their cane green an' make syrup from green cane. If it's not good an'

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
sweet, it'll have a kind of bitter whang. But you let the seeds get good an' 
ripe on your cane, cut it down, strip th'fodder off it and bring it to a cane 
mill t'make syrup. That's what old people baked their sweet bread out of. 
Th'people who grew it sold it t'people who didn't have it. They wasn't too 
many people had mills. They'd take it t'other people's mills an' make it. 
Sorghum makes an awful black syrup. We thought it was good then. Black 
soil like we had won't make clear syrup—you have t'have a red clay t'make 
clear syrup.
BURNETT BROOKS: There's not a whole lot to growing cane. The work 
starts when it ripens. You just plant it and forget about it for sixty to sixty-
five days. You don't even put much fertilizer on it. It's really an easy crop 
grown. You can plow and hoe it about twice. You don't have to spray it 
[for bugs]. Then you take it up about this time of year [the middle of 
October]. This [year's crop] wasn't planted until July fourth because of 
the weather, but usually we try to get it in around the beginning of June. 
LAWTON BROOKS: Cane is something that takes a soil that's not too 
rich—a good clay soil's the best. Sow it in rows so it can be worked a time 
or two during the summer—it's best to sow it in early June. It won't take 
too much wet weather, 'cause it's bad to blow over during bad weather, and 
that ruins it.
You've got t'try t'get it stripped, cut down, and made into syrup when 
it's ripe; if y'wait too long it could come a frost on it in the field and that 
ruins the taste of the syrup. If y'think it's gonna soon come a frost, and it's 
still in the field, y'can strip it, cut it down, and stack and cover it for a few 
days, and the frost won't hurt it that way, but y'can't leave it stacked too 
long because it won't make as good syrup.
HARRIET ECHOLS: My father grew cane. All those mountain folk 
made their own syrup. You plant it in the spring. Syrup was cheap and it

fully ripe.

was hard work. We couldn't sell it. I used to sell it for twenty-five cents a 
gallon. My father just made hundreds and hundreds of gallons. He cooked 
syrup for all the neighbors. He had his own equipment, his own furnace 
and cooking vat and everything. Everybody couldn't own a vat to cook 
syrup 'cause it was too expensive. One person in the neighborhood like 
would start the operation. They paid'em so much, I don't remember the 
prices now, but we always had a big cane patch. I had to hoe it, and that 
was a job. Plum up until after I married, we had cane.
Tobacco
HARRIET ECHOLS: You get the seed and prepare your bed. First you 
put your fertilize or barnyard litter in it. Frame it in with planks and put a 
screen over it. Dig the dirt up and make it soft. Then, in the early spring, 
sow the seed, just pat them in. They are little seeds and you don't want 
them very deep. When they come up then you put a screen over them; or 
wire; then a plastic cover. You plant them on the east side so the morning 
sun will hit them. You let your plants get up six to eight inches high, at least 
six. Maybe eight. The bigger the better.
Then you set them out in your tobacco patch. You have to work the soil 
carefully to keep the weeds down. Plow it, but you can't plow close to the 
plants; you have to go around and be careful not to bruise them. When it 
starts to ripen, it goes to seed; it has a bloom and a seed on top. Then you 
top it. They have little suckers on them, little plants that come out on the 
stalk at the leaves. You have to pinch those little suckers off to make good 
tobacco, and all that strength goes to the leaves. Then when it ripens 
enough all the leaves go together.
They cured the tobacco back then. They didn't have curing houses just 
for a small farm. They would just hang it in the barn.
ESCO PITTS: My grandfather grew tobacco for his own use, a patch 
about as big as this room [12'X14']. When those leaves began to turn— 
now that was his job, we couldn't do that—he'd go through the field when 
those bottom leaves began to turn and very carefully pick one off at a time 
and put them in a basket. He'd go over his little patch two to three times 
a week. He'd take those big tobacco leaves, tie a bunch together, take'em 
and hang'em up in the barn till they got good and dry. He'd put'em where 
we couldn't get to it. It was hard to grow; seems like every three to four 
days checking those leaves, looking for worms. I always wanted to work 
with him in his tobacco, but no, that was apart.
When he got ready to twist his tobacco, he would make a sweetened 
water with homemade syrup and he'd put a big wagon sheet down, put his 
nice leaves down on that sheet, and take that sweetened water and sprinkle

it on the tobacco. When it got pretty damp, why, he'd twist it. He'd keep 
on until he got it done. Some parts he'd have for chewin', and some for 
smokin". I'm pretty sure he saved his seed. Some people had big old tobacco 
patches. They didn't sell it. They made their tobacco and they divided it 
with people who didn't have any.
Hay
LAWTON BROOKS: Lots of people grew hay. They could sow it along 
in August in their corn. After I laid by my corn, I'd go in th'corn an' sow it. 
Then when y'gather your corn, you go back in there, cut th'stalks, rake 
them off, an' you'll have you a clear meadow. An' then when your hay gets 
up big enough t'cut, you cut it sometime in th'spring. They'd get an old 
mule mowing machine [pulled with mules or horses]. Then they had an old 
rake driven with horses, an' it'd rake up an' when it got full, you'd trip it 
an' it'd dump th'hay. Then after it cured, y'had t'stack it. Didn't have no 
balers then.
You could get three cuttings out of a meadow. You won't get too much 
th'third time. It keeps comin' up by itself each time. Then you could plow it 
under and put it in something else, like corn.
HARRIET ECHOLS: Hay is a crop raised in most every area now. All 
the work is done with tractors and big machinery today, but used to be, it 
was all done by hand. Lot of times people would plant grass on worn out
PLATE 213    Belle Dryman and her son Foy put up these haystarks. Her cows have

cornfields, where the land wasn't good enough to grow other crops any-
more.
When the hay got up tall enough and there was a good stretch of dry 
weather, people'd go out with their scythe and cut it. Now some folks had 
horse-drawn moving machines, but we didn't. How long it takes to cure 
depends on the temperature, how long the sun is out, and the humidity. 
They'd turn it a time or two with rakes while it was curing, till it was ready. 
Then they'd rake it up and haul it in the wagon where they were going to 
put their stacks. We didn't know what a bale of hay was. I didn't see one 
until I was full grown, 'cause they didn't have the machinery to work with 
like they do now.
BELLE DRYMAN: We stack our hay yet. [My son] Foy bales some, but 
we don't have enough cover for it all. We put up a tall pole t'stack the hay 
around it, then lay some brush on the ground [around the pole] so it 
doesn't set on th'ground. Then we just go to stackin' it around the pole. 
Y'have t'try t'make the top of the stack bigger than th'bottom, and you 
have t'lay th'hay on the top so the water'll run off. It'll keep right on— 
just a little on the outside'll get moldy.
Rye, wheat, and oats
ESCO PITTS: You can plant wheat in December, and harvest it late next 
spring. Back then people had t'harvest it with a cradle, an' th'same thing 
with rye and oats. I've followed my father many a time and banded it, 
picked it up and tied it in bundles, an' put eight bundles to th'shock. Let 
that cure, an' th'thrashing machine'd come around after a while an' thrash 
it. You grow all three 'bout th'same way, except y'sow your rye when you 
lay by your corn in June. We never grew many oats, but I think we sowed 
them in th'spring. They'd just cut th'oats in th'green stage, and feed it 
whole to th'animals—grain and hay and all.
LAWTON BROOKS: You can sow rye in August in your corn—it likes 
cooler weather. I'uz always proud t'see th'old thrasher come in there— 
pulled by oxen—after we cut it with a old-time cradle. M'daddy'd cradle it 
an' me an' m'brother'd tie it in pretty good-sized bundles. Then we'd go 
back an' shock it—several bundles in a shock an' two bundles spread out 
on th'top for a kind of roof. Stayed dry till we got ready t'stack it in th'field. 
We'd stack it when th'old iron thrasher could be brought in by th'oxen. 
When they got done thrashin' at my house, he'd go to yours. We had to 
haul wood for the thrasher—it had a old steam boiler. We'd stack the straw 
t'use for bed ticks. Ever'year we got new straw for our bed ticks.
We grew our wheat and oats. At harvest time, you cut your wheat and

185
had a thrasher thrash that wheat out, sack it up, take it to the mill and get 
your flour. The oats was for the animals.
HARRY BROWN: Well, th'way we thrashed th'rye, we laid a bunch of 
poles over a hole in th'ground, and laid a wagon sheet in th'hole. We laid 
th'rye on top of th'poles [over the hole] an' beat it with a pole. You get as 
much as you would out of a thrashing machine, just took longer. Th'rye 
falls down into th'wagon sheet—then you take that wagon sheet out, and 
put it in sacks. Then y'had a lot of chaff in it. Well, on a windy day, you 
get out and pick up a handful of rye an' pour it over into another sack, and 
th'wind blows th'chaff out of it.
HARRIET ECHOLS: Rye, wheat, and oats, it's all planted the same way. 
Except rye, they'd plant it earlier in August or September. The rye will 
make without being plowed. Wheat and oats, they had to prepare the 
ground. It's the same way they did hay. They didn't have to sow the ground 
as thick as they did hay, because it spreads as it comes up. They planted 
wheat and oats about the same time. If they had winter oats, they'd plant
PLATE 214    Louin Cabe shows us how a grain cradle is used.

186 
FOXFIRE 4
them in the fall, the spring oats in February or March. The winter oats will 
stand the hard freezes, but the spring oats they had to put in when the hard 
freezes were over.
They had to prepare the ground the same way, put in the fertilizer or the 
barnyard litter, whatever they had. Broadcast it over the land, then plowed 
it under, then sowed their grain. A lot of people used to sow it in rows. 
They had this machinery to sow it. One little grain will come up and make 
dozens of stalks. Then they had to harvest it. They'd cut it with grain cra-
dles, and put it in bundles and shock it. It was hard labor all together. They 
called it cradling the grain. The grain cradle was as sharp as a razor blade 
—it had to be to cut the grain. When the shock cured, they'd haul it to the 
barn where the thrasher could go, and thrash it out. It took four or five to 
operate the thrasher.
Pests
Interestingly enough, all the people we talked to said the insect problem 
used to be very small. Some felt it had to do with the fact that people often 
burned off their gardens and fields before planting, and that the mountains 
were burned over every year. We were assured that there would have been 
little need for chemical insecticides even if they had already been developed. 
It must have been quite a blow to people who had for years grown healthy, 
relatively bug-free vegetables and crops, to witness the ever-growing insect 
population and watch them lower their gardens' productivity.
Animals, however, both wild and domestic, presented a greater problem 
to people's gardens years ago. For this reason almost everyone fenced their 
vegetable gardens, and while cattle, etc., were still on open range, most peo-
ple fenced their fields. Following we present a general quote from Anna 
Howard about pests; after that we'll give suggestions on dealing with indi-
vidual pests, and finally, we'll present a small piece on fencing.
ANNA HOWARD: [There are so many insects now] 'cause they ain't no 
cattle nor hogs nor nothin' in th'woods is my idea. An' people don't burn 
like they used to—burn off fields and big brush piles, kill all them insects.
I remember we had rats. They'd get in th'garden once in a while and eat 
a little in the garden. We didn't do anything about them. Now crows would 
eat up your corn crop if you didn't keep them scared out. We'd make scare-
crows and put around the edge of th'field—that'd scare'em out. Sometimes 
they would get so bad, people would get out in th'edge of th'woods and 
shoot at'em.
Now we had rabbits. They was worse than anything else. We kids would 
have a couple of rabbit boxes set out in the edge of th'field, and every

morning or two, we"d bring in a couple a'rabbits and Mama'd cook'em. 
Th'rabbits could get through a fence like that, but they had s'much stuff 
t'eat back then, they didn't bother gardens like they do now. We had moles, 
an' used to, one of us'd sit around through th'day with a hoe t'kill it, but 
then we got a mole trap. Th'ground squirrels got in a lot and we'd shoot 
[them] an' eat'em. See, we kept dogs, and that was our pastime.
Well, now, 'coons, they'd eat corn in th'field after it got hard an' dried 
up. But th'rabbits, they'd eat stuff some, but you could put up scare-boogers 
an' keep'em out, an' nearly everybody kept dogs to keep'em run out of their 
garden. People'ud make scare-boogers t'look like a man an' put a hat an' 
clothes on'em.

they'll rattle in the wind and reflect the sun intermittently and scare 
them off 
• shoot one crow and hang it up in the garden—it will keep others away

Moles:
watch for them from 10:00 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., and dig them out and
kill them
put kitchen matches in the mole run—they will eat the heads and the
sulfur will poison them
set a mole trap in the run
put mothballs in the run
stick rose stems in the sides of the runs—they'll scratch themselves on
the thorns and bleed to death
teach your dogs and cats to kill them
soak corn in lye or arsenic and put some in the run, and poison them
put very salty cornmeal dough or biscuit dough in the run—if they eat
it, it'll kill them
plant mole plants (also called castor beans) around your garden
put small windmills in the garden—the vibrations will drive the moles
off
whenever you kill a mole, put him in another mole run and his body
will scare off other moles
get a long metal pipe, fill one end with strong tobacco, light it, and
force the smoke into the run by blowing on the other end of the pipe
sprinkle salt in the runs

Owls:
• set a steel trap baited with a piece of chicken on top of a pole
Rabbits:
• get a good rabbit dog 
• sit around out of sight and shoot one when you see it and then make 
rabbit stew 
• set up stakes around the garden and run a string about six inches off 
the ground around the garden—they won't cross the string 
• set out rabbit boxes (traps) 
• sow lettuce in your squash—it'll put the rabbits to sleep 
• put up a fence 
• plant marigolds in your beans, or petunias in your potatoes—the smell 
will keep them away 
• set an old shoe out in the row 
• feed them all they can eat, and they won't eat up your garden 
• set glass jars around in your garden roughly twenty feet apart. The 
sound of the wind blowing over their tops will scare them away. 
• fill a gallon jug with water, add one tablespoon of kerosene, and sprin 
kle it on and around the plants the rabbits will eat; the smell will keep 
them away for several days 
• take a piece of paper like the Atlanta Constitution, two or three folds 
of it (it has to be this big because it won't rattle if you don't) and fold 
the paper down over the stake at the top. Tie a string big enough to fit 
around the stake so the paper won't blow off. It looks just like some 
body's head and arms flapping. When the wind blows, the paper rat 
tles and flaps and scares them something awful. 
• string some aluminum pans on wire. Be sure you string them over 
whatever the animal is eating. You can tie the wire to two stakes, 
trees, or anything that's near around. Don't put on too many—just 
enough so when the wind blows, they'll rattle. And they shine in 
the dark, so that helps. 
Raccoons:
• keep a good 'coon dog and hunt raccoons regular during gardening 
season

Fences
Most people put up a paling fence around their vegetable gardens. A pal-
ing fence is sort of a rough picket fence made of hand-split boards, pointed 
on top so the chickens wouldn't fly up on it and then into the garden. Many 
people fenced in their farm crops, too, but there they used split rails put to-
gether in a zigzag pattern for that. These fences kept out larger domestic 
and wild animals which would eat the vegetables and/or farm crops.
ESCO PITTS: You had to enclose your garden so my daddy split chestnut 
palings in those days. Chestnut trees was mostly what he built his house out 
of. Chestnut trees would be sixty feet to the first limb and long straight 
trees. And they would split awful easy and he would just split palings about 
six to eight feet long. They're thin slats about three quarters of an inch 
thick, about four to six inches wide, and as long as you want to make them. 
Then he put his locust posts in every eight feet and made his railings one at 
the bottom and one at the top to nail his palings to. The palings went up 
and down; they were sharp on the ends.

R. M. DICKERSON: Everybody had to fence their own fields. You had 
fence logs and you were supposed to take care of your own cow yourself. But 
back when I was out here, they had what y'called an open range and any-
body could turn their cattle out, and if you had a cornfield; you had to keep 
it fenced up to keep the cattle out. But after we voted out the free range and 
voted in the fencin', ever'body that had cattle had to put them up and 
keep'em in their own pasture. After that we didn't have to fence our 
cornfields so much.
DIFFERENCES IN THE OLD AND NEW
Many people we spoke to felt that the vegetables they used to grow tasted 
better than those they grow today. The differences were attributed to the 
facts that they used to grow non-hybrids, whereas today most seeds are 
hybrids; that they used to grow vegetables totally organically, but don't 
now; and that age may have hindered their sense of taste.
ANNA HOWARD: I think the fertilizers make a difference. I think that 
makes th'difference in the taste of the plants we eat. You take people that 
use stable manure for their garden; I think that makes a difference in the 
flavor of the food—it grows off better. Now I garden with store-bought fer-
tilizer, and I don't like it either. I can't get a good pretty garden like I 
want to. I think about back when I was a kid and my father used t'have 
those pretty gardens. And now I can't get one like that, and I'm sure it's 
that stable manure. It's really good for a garden.
ADA KELLY: I really believe that some of them had a richer flavor. They 
were grown just from the soil with no additions at all, and it just seems that 
they had a better flavor.
LAWTON BROOKS: They have a lot of difference—in th'beans an' in 
th'tomatoes and things like that. Th'beans taste altogether different from 
th'kind they used to grow then.
HARRIET ECHOLS: There is a difference in the taste of vegetables now 
and then. I don't know whether it's that we people have grown older and 
our taste buds are getting away from us, dimming, like our eyes, but it 
doesn't seem like the vegetables here taste as good now as they used to. You 
know, I used to love fruits and I ate them all the time. I still do, but I have 
to force myself. I don't care for them like I used to, I don't know why.

BIRD TRAPS, DEADFALLS,
AND RABBIT BOXES
L
BIRD TRAPS
awton Brooks, one of our most
informative contacts (Foxfire 3,
pages 221-44, for example),
amazed us again by showing us how to do something that we hadn't seen
before. Lawton, who stops by our office occasionally, revealed on one par-
ticular afternoon that he could make a bird trap—a trap that not only
caught other small game as well as birds, but one that also left the animal
alive. Since we were interested in other methods and devices that snared an-
imals such as rabbit boxes and deadfalls, we asked Lawton to show two of
the students who work with us, Robbie Moore and David Hopkins, how he
made one. As Lawton made it, he told us a little bit about them, as well as a
funny story about his brother:
"Back when I first learned to make bird traps, my brother Neil and I
would use our father's boards. He always kept a stack of boards around for
patching the roof with—everything was covered with old-time boards.
Well, we'd slip those boards and split'em up and make the trap out of them.
We didn't have no nails. We knew that if we got his nails, he'd raise cain.
You could use nails, though. But we had to learn to do it the way we had to
do it. We didn't have no nails to nail'em together with, so we put a bow
on'em to hold'em together.
"We used to catch a lot of quails, or any kind of little bird that would
come and get in it. 'Course you take an ol' hog or something big, they'd tear
it up pretty easily, but just common game won't. I've caught rabbits in it
before. You can bait it with corn or anything. You just make the trigger
and put a nubbin of corn, a piece of bread, or anything you want to put on
it, and the animal or bird will come."
As Lawton showed us how to make the trap, he told us a little about his
childhood. There were six children, four boys and two girls. His oldest
brother was Ernest, then after him was Wayne, then came Neil, and Law-
ton was the youngest boy. Neil died as a result of the flu in the flu epidemic
about the time of World War One. He was twenty-one, and was working as
a brakeman on a train. "He took the flu, but got better and thought he had

============================================================
PAGE 192
============================================================

to go back to work. The doctor told him to stay in, but he went to work
anyway. He took a backset and never got over it. He hadn't been married
but a month or two when he died."
As he talked about his brother Neil, Lawton remembered something the
two of them had done when they were younger.
"Neil was about the size of this one here [Robbie, age sixteen] when he
jumped out of the barn loft. He thought he was going to make him a kite
and fly, and he liked to have got killed.
"We had big doors at either end of the hayloft up in the barn. We'd push
the hay out into the cow lot from there. We didn't have much hay up there
at the time. My daddy and mother had gone to town and left Neil and me
alone. They'd always tell Neil to take care of me. My mother and daddy
had one of these big ol' canvas umbrellas. You'd set in the buggy and it'd
cover the whole buggy.
"So Neil got to studying about making a parachute. He said, 'Tell you
what let's do. Let's take this umbrella, take a run to go, and jump out that
lower door [of the barn]. Just as you jump, open it. And you'll float down
to the ground easy.'
"He tried to get me to do it. Well, I started to. I ran to the door, but
when I looked down, I stopped. I couldn't do it. And he commenced to
hollerin', 'You're a chicken, you're a chicken. I'll show you how to do it.'
"So he just backed in there and he took a run to go, and when he opened
the umbrella, it just went wrong side out. He hit the ground like a log. He
didn't move for a long time, knocked the breath out of him. I thought he
was gone, too. I looked down there. I went down the stair-steps and out in
the lot and rolled him over three or four times before he ever got his breath.
I was just sure that it had killed him. But he was all right. He was just sore.
My daddy asked him, 'What's the matter with you, Neil?'
"And he said, 'Well, I'm just kind of sore like I been lifting or some-
thing.'
"And I was afraid to tell my father anything. I knowed that if I did, me
and Neil would have a fight."

PLATE 219 
Lawton begins the trap
by laying two boards (24"xH"X 3/4")
parallel about 22" apart. He then lays
two more boards across these to form a
square.

PLATE 220 
Lawton adds on boards
alternately going straight up on two
sides and sloping the other two sides
until the trap is eight to ten boards
high.
PLATE 221 
He then "tops off" the
trap with several more boards so the
birds cannot fly out the top. Lawton
says, "You can top off the trap anytime
you want to. Make the spacing in the
boards so the bird [or animal] can see
and they ain't in the dark."
PLATE 222

boards in place.
PLATE 223 
Lawton does not use nails
in making his traps, but holds them to-
gether with a bow—a green stick about
2' long that he pulls taut over the top
and ties with rope to the bottom board
on either side.
PLATE 224 Diagram shows scale of
the sticks used to make the trigger.
Stick "A" is 9" long, "B" is 9/2", and
"C" is 20". The sticks are the same as
those used for the deadfall trap (see
PLATE 229).

The trigger is made of
small green sticks of hickory or other
hardwood. 
Lawton 
carves 
out 
the
notches while the wood is green and pli-
able, then lets it dry before putting any
stress on it. The set trigger is baited on
the right end of the horizontal section
with bread or corn or other bait.
PLATE 226 The trigger assembly is
made of three sticks. When set up, they
make the numeral four. When set, they
hold together only because of the
weight of the trap pushing down on the
vertical stick. It is so delicately set and
balanced that the slightest movement by
the animal or bird against the horizon-
tal piece will collapse the trigger assem-
bly and bring the trap down. The base
of the vertical stick is not stuck into the
ground, but sits on top of the ground so
that it will fall over easily and not keep
the trap from falling.
PLATE 227 
The set trap. As the bird or animal nibbles at the bait, the trap falls,
holding the victim unharmed inside the trap.

DEADFALLS
A deadfall trap works on exactly the same principle, and uses the same
triggering device, as the bird trap Lawton Brooks showed us how to make.
By definition, however, a deadfall kills the animal when the trigger is
released.
Tedra Harmon explained that when he sets up a deadfall trap, he finds a
large flat rock that is heavy enough to crush any animal unlucky enough to
be under it when it falls. He then raises one end and sets the trigger. As
with a bird trap, the bait is placed on the pointed end of the horizontal
stick. In order to keep the bait on the stick more securely, Tedra pushes it
past the pointed end, splits the end, and drives a wedge into the split to
spread the end and anchor the bait in place. For rabbits and possums, he
uses apples, beets, or cabbage for bait. For raccoons, he uses sardines. For
minks, foxes, possums, or skunks, Tedra baits the trap with one third of a
gray squirrel or a whole bird.
To insure that the animal enters the trap only from the front, wood,
rocks, and brush are placed at both sides of the trap.

Though rabbit boxes have been mentioned in the past [see The Foxfire

ANNIE PERRY
A
nnie Perry is a lively eighty-
three-year-old lady who lives
in a home that her ancestors
built before the Civil War. The one thing that really amazed me about
Annie when I first met her was her remarkable memory. She can remember
things that I can't remember from one day to the next. For example, she
can remember how to measure a room to see how many bushels of corn it
will hold; she remembers how to figure out the interest on borrowed
money; but I think the most important thing she remembers is .that we are
all in this world together and that we have to love and help each other.
Annie also has a great love for animals. The first time we met her, she
had a newborn pig whose mother had died and she was feeding it on a bot-
tle until it got big enough to eat.
She has the gift of making anybody feel at home with her. She told us
that one thing she loves to do is talk, especially when there are people there
to listen. Annie talks a lot about her hair and how it used to be so long and
beautiful. She has told us many times that she thinks a person's hair is their
beat feature, and she told us that she wished her hair was still long and
thick.
But Annie doesn't have to worry about her hair or her outer appearance.
I know that inside Annie is the most beautiful person I've ever known, and
that means more to me than any outer beauty anywhere.

I've lived here all my life, 'round and about. This house was started about
July 1864, and in August it was finished with a top on it. My grandfather
and his neighbors built it. It didn't have any chimney and Grandmother

cooked outdoors under a brush arbor. In the fall, they sealed the cracks
with boards, three-foot pieces split out of timber. The house was first
covered with logs and built like a bird trap at the end. It was tapered up
with logs for the gable and logs put across from the long ways of the house
[poles running the length of the building acting as both rafters and lathing].
They put the chimney on that fall. It lasted about a hundred years. We
tore it down about fifteen years ago because it looked like it was going to
fall on us.
The first floor was a puncheon floor; it wasn't plank but made of split
logs that were about two inches thick. Then they were smoothed off. There
have been three extra floors [since then].
We had store-bought furniture. We had a little iron bedstead and its
head and foot weren't no bigger than my little finger. Then we had one
homemade bedstead that was a great big old thing. It had great big posts,
big railings, and slats. It didn't have any cords—it wasn't a corded bed-
stead, never did have one of those. We had straw mattresses and cleaned
them out every year. We'd burn the old and get some new. I'll tell you
what, they lay just as good after you get them fixed and leveled up. They
Jay good with a big, heavy quilt over the top of that straw mattress, just as
good a bed as anyone wants to lie on. Mother had a feather bed.

My mother, my aunt, and my uncle all grew up in this house. My mother
and father lived here till I was born, and then they built them a house up
on a hill from here, and we lived up there till my grandmother died in
1925, and then we moved back down here. We moved down here on ac-
count of the spring. Papa thought the spring was the greatest thing that
ever has been. I've been here ever since.
I don't want no city life because I don't like it. I lived in a city in South
Carolina for two months, and I didn't like it. I lived there long enough to
know I don't like it, because I like neighbors, but they were just too close
there.
When you live in the country, you can have a garden and you can go
pick fresh vegetables when you want'em, and they don't cost you so much.
God gives you the strength and if you use what He gave you, you might not
make a bountiful crop, but you can make some. If you've lived long enough
and nobody won't hire you and you're able to work, you can make you
something to eat, and you ran eat it.

I like to be close to people, but I don't like them to live in my door! I like
to be where, if I take a notion to fuss, I can fuss.
Oh, I'd be like a bird in a cage. Catch a bird and put it in a cage—living
in town—that'd be like a bird in a cage.
I think children have freedom [in the country] that they don't have in
the city or a town. Now you can't turn a child loose in town; you can turn
one loose in the country. I just know that a child in the country has free-
dom, but they don't have as many advantages. They do have advantages
enough. They won't be near as mean. They can have their minds occupied
with something else besides badness.
[Out in the country] you breathe more oxygen, and more pure oxygen.
The oxygen that we gather from the air is more pure than it is when you're
in a city or town. It's not been breathed.
They's some difference in people in the country and people in the city,
but there's no real difference in people. People's people.
My father farmed around here near the creek. He'd gather up a load of
apples. He'd have apples and cabbages and potatoes, and carried them to
Anderson, South Carolina. He'd buy us shoes out of the money and pay his
taxes.
One time I was with him, and something happened that wasn't funny.
My feet caught afire. We had a tent and we had a spread on the ground.
We built a fire in front of the tent and for some reason the quilts caught
afire at my feet and I woke up. I said, "Daddy, get up from here. We're
afire." That's my last time camping out. I don't want to camp out any
more.
When I was a little girl, my parents didn't buy too much. Mama made
our stockings and dresses and sweaters. We had to buy coffee, sugar, and
salt. We never did buy any flavoring because if we wanted apple pie, we
wanted apple pie, and if we wanted peach pie, we wanted peach pie. We
didn't add extra flavorings. I guess during my daddy's and mother's life,
they didn't buy five dollars' worth of flavorings.
My parents grew all kinds of things—beans, potatoes, peas, onions, let-
tuce, corn, beets, and lots more—one time, Mama raised some celery. We'd
use this to feed ourselves and the stock. And we raised cane to make syrup
—used to have plenty of syrup. We planted by the signs—I still do. Plant
corn on the new of the moon, it grows tall, but plant it on the full of the
moon and it won't grow so tall. But now the signs of the zodiac—you can
plant potatoes when the signs are on the bowels and they'll rot. And beans,
you can plant'em on the signs of the bowels and they'll be covered with lit-
tle black snakes. Plant your beans when the sign's in the feet and in the
thighs, because they'll bear next to the ground. And when the sign's in the

arms, you plant your cucumbers. Your root crops, you plant when the sign's
in the legs and feet. Now as for other things, we'd make jelly on the new of
the moon, and get a whole lot more jelly and the juice would jell quicker
than making it on the full of the moon.
My grandmother'd make her own soap. And she'd always make the soap
on the new of the moon. That's when you just see it jelling the best.
When we'd kill hogs, we'd always try t'kill'em on the decrease of the
moon—when it gets smaller. And then your meat won't puff up and be big
old thick pieces, and it's easier to render. [See the chapter on planting by
the signs in The Foxfire Book.]
We had a lot of animals—oxen, mules, a horse, hogs, cows, chickens,
ducks, sheep, dogs, and cats. The hogs and cows went wherever they
pleased all over the mountains.
We've had bees ever since I could remember. There weren't no grand-
children for a long time except Suzie and me, and I begged Grandpa for
some bees. He gave me one stand and he said the first time that one
swarms, it belongs to Suzie. The next thing, it swarmed and that one was

Suzie's. We had "this one's mine and that one's yours" a long time. Each
one knew his beehive.
The most important thing I had, what I liked best, were my sheep. Yes.
Because they were gentle and they were pretty when they were little. I also
liked cattle and hogs. I liked all animals. That's why I said I wasn't no
housekeeper. It's because I was always helpin' take care of the hogs and
sheep, and I've milked since I was twelve years old. That's the reason I like
outdoor life. All that I did was outdoor work. I never did do any indoor
work. I just helped my daddy. I was the only "boy" he had for sixteen
years. I was sixteen when Dennis was born, and they treated us the same.
I think everybody should work. We're all put here to work. We are all
put here to make a living by the sweat of our brows. And some people are
more fortunate than others. You can abuse the body by overworking. I
mean working in a way that hurts you.
Work keeps people's minds occupied and keeps'em from doing things
they're nor supposed to do. If they got their minds on their work, they'll be
successful.
I had a lot of chores to do before I went to school. And I had chores to
do when I got back from school. We had no special time to play. We played
when we got the time.
We didn't work for fun; we worked to have something to live on. Papa'd
make his axe handles of a night by the fire, and his mauls that he used, and
singletrees he'd use on the plowstock. We had pine knot lights to see by at
night for a long time. I was already grown when Mama first bought her
kerosene lamp, and it was little bitty lamp that'd hold about a pint—it
made a good light. It was a curiosity, and kerosene oil cost five cents a gal-
lon.
We worked all the time. Even in the winter, we fixed the fence around
the farm, and done clearing around, and when the ground was dry enough
we'd plow in the winter. I had to feed the chickens, ducks, hogs, sheep, but
I went to school every minute that we had school. My daddy never kept us
out a minute from going to school, no matter how much work he had to do
that we could help him do. He said he didn't want us to grow up like he
did.
We had a hard time washing the clothes. We had a big old pot (I've still
got that washpot) of iron, and you gather up your dirty clothes, take'em
down to the branch, fill up your tubs with water, fill up th'pot, heat it good
and have it warm, and have homemade lye soap, and a big stick about so
long, trimmed off like a bat. You'd have a big stump, piece of wood settin'
up that way, and put your clothes on there and beat'em with that stick, and
then put'em in the pot and put a fire around the pot, and some soap in the
pot, parboil'cm, and then boil'em. Then you rinse your clothes and get all

the soap out. You didn't have a wringer; you wrung this way [Annie makes
a wringing motion] with your hands. And then hang'em out on the line and
let'em dry and they'd be pretty and white. We'd hang'em on the grapevine,
and go to the woods and get long, slim poles, and get one with a fork and
set it in there and hang your clothes on that. The clothes were real strong
then, not like what we got now. [The clothes today wouldn't] last long,
would they? You get after'em with a battlin' stick like I used to have to get
after Dad's old britches—it would get'em clean.
I didn't have very many toys. I'll tell you what toys we had—we had two
dogs and two cats and a rag doll. My grandma made me a rag doll about
three feet long one time. Yes, she took a one-pound flour sack to make the
front of it. Stuffed it with cotton. Me and Suzie, that's my sister, we'd take
care of our cats. We had two old cats, Sandy and Coachie. And Bouncing
Ring was the dog. He'd .go as far as from here to the top of the hill and stay
all day. We'd play with our dogs and cats. We didn't have toys like children
do now. We climbed trees, too. I fell out one time and like to broke my
neck. And I'll tell you another thing. Down below where we went to play,
there was a branch—and a white oak right on the edge, and a limb sticking
out. We'd catch ahold of that limb, swing way out over that branch. We'd
a'killed ourselves if we'd a'fallen. Papa came along and found us hanging
on that limb. He cut it off. That ended the fun. He cut it down.
We'd play ball and drop-the-handkerchief and ring-them-a-rosie. We
also played grape-vine twist. It's a dance. We didn't have any music. They's
two sides to everything, you know. Each fella had a partner. Ring up
around us and we'd break and swing backwards. It's lots of fun. Now that
was a game we used to play at school. They didn't allow us to do that ei-
ther, and we'd slip off down the road, halfway to the top of the hill, that's
where we'd all go. Just have a partner apiece and we'd just have a big time.
We played big ring. It ain't nothing but square dancing and there's noth-
ing that's any more interesting. If nobody gets lost!! The teachers didn't
allow it. They didn't think it was right. There's no harm in dancing, surely,
if it's carried out right. There's not a bit no more harm in square dancing
than there is in eating.
My parents were strict, and they wasn't only strict at the house, but if
they let us off by ourselves, my daddy would say, "Now, you'd better not do
this what I'm telling you not to do. I get ahold of it, and I'll whip you."
Well, we didn't do it, because my daddy was a truthful man and he'd whip
me. He wouldn't have let us get by with it. When he let us go to the neigh-
bors' house to play with the children, he'd say, "If they're going somewhere,
you come back. I want to know where you are." If they were going some-
where, we came back home. He kept a real close eye—well, he just wanted

to know where we were. He said he didn't want to turn us loose and let us
be from here to the Chatooga River and not know where we were.
We didn't have much freedom. Sometimes I thought we didn't have
enough, but that was his way of thinking, and if there was one thing we
were not allowed to do—we were not allowed to talk back. Daddy gave me
one whipping—one whipping. Mama gave me many whippings—I didn't
keep count. But Daddy whipped me one time for telling him I'd not do it;
if he wanted it done to do it himself. He made me come to him, made me
come between his legs and sit on one leg and he set on a woodpile and
talked to me. He said, "Now, Annie, I'm your daddy and you're not going
to talk to me like this and you're going to respect me. I'm your daddy.
When you are grown, you may talk to me like that but not as long as you
stay under my roof."
He taught me to be truthful, honest, and kind to everybody and not to
speak ugly to a grown person and not to touch a thing that belonged to the
other person without asking. When we first started to school, the path went
by this little bridge where Mrs. Bleckley had an apple tree and apples would
fall in the road, and we didn't have any apples. Daddy said, "Now, Annie,
Mrs. Bleckley has an apple tree right there on the side of the road and don't
you go picking up her apples."
I went to school about two miles and a half from here, toward the east. I
went for thirteen years. One of my nieces said, "Why, Annie, I wouldn't
a'went that long!" I went till I was twenty-two years old. Yes, and I didn't
get farther than the seventh grade. But that was all right, I went to school.
I wasn't so dumb, but there wasn't nothing else to do from July to Decem-

ber. We'd help my daddy in the fields. Then we'd have nothing to do, and
the teacher would say, "If you've got nothing to do, well come on then,
maybe you'll learn something." I never went a year but what I learned
something. I was seven when I started. The schoolhouse was a good build-
ing. It was built in plank. The first school building I ever went to was
about a mile from here. I went there till I was ten or twelve years old. And
then they consolidated the schools together, there was two schools. One
couldn't get along through the winter by itself, so they put'em both to-
gether. Then I went from this side of the Baptist Church to a slab-block
building with a roof on it. When it rained, it leaked at the top of the door.
We'd go start up to class, go up right through that water. We went in about
eight-thirty, supposed to get there by then, and you'd have an hour and a
half of recreation. An hour at lunch and fifteen minutes in the morning and
fifteen minutes in the afternoon. We done some tall playing at that hour;
run ourselves to death playing ball!
We studied history, geography, English, arithmetic, and spelling. I wish I
could find me a United States history book. I started out at three [months
in the school year] and quit at six months. The county provided that. I
don't know, I guess the state paid in some taxes, too. But the teachers didn't
get but thirty-five dollars a month, and that was the one that got the most.
From twenty to thirty-five dollars. They had what they called Teachers' In-
stitute, and they'd go and they'd train'em. Then they'd give'em their
papers and have'em to work at them. And then they'd grade their papers,
and they had one, two, and three—three grades, first, second, third. I never
had a school teacher in my life, honey, that had a high school education.
They generally went through the seventh grade, and went to this Teachers'
Institute. A good scholar that had just finished the seventh grade could
teach school. I'm not fooling you.
I don't want to teach school 'cause there are too many bad young'uns. I
don't want that responsibility on my hands. I went to school, and I've been
in school, and I know good and well that the poor old school teacher just
had to sit there and take it from he or she or whoever it was. Give the child
a whipping and he'd go home and tell all in his favor—in his favor. And
here [the parents] come. Well, I said, "Shoot, I'd rather be a knot on a
hickory tree than be a school teacher. I ain't a bit better yet, not a school
teacher. Oh, whee, no!! I believe in correcting children myself, and I be-
lieve in whippin'em with a switch. I don't believe in hitting with a paddle.
You can make black and blue spots with'em and hardly know you're using
it.
The children don't have the education, the knowledge, that I had. I'm a
wLse guy now. They don't know anything about everyday life, about every-
day living. I've questioned sonic of the children around here, and I know

============================================================
PAGE 208

they don't know it. They don't know how to measure lumber, they don't
know how to measure how much corn a room would hold with the dimen-
sions being ten feet high, eight feet wide, and twelve feet long—they don't
know how to find th'dimensions of a bushel of corn. They don't know arith-
metic; they don't know English; they don't know spelling. You need those
—they're the most essential subjects there are. Why these children couldn't
tell me if they had two hundred to lend to someone on 8 per cent interest
for two years and six months. They couldn't tell me how much whoever
borrowed the money would be due them at the end of the two years and six
months. Can you? I can! They don't teach that now—or they didn't teach
the children around here that. That's what I call everyday living.
People had different ideals when I was growing up, different all the way
around. For instance, children are not taught to work like we did—we had
to work to make our bread. When we got out of school, we didn't loaf here
and yonder, no sir. Now they lie in bed till ten o'clock, get up and eat their
dinner—come back in twelve, one o'clock in the night. I didn't do that—
there wasn't nowhere to go—none of this running up and down the road
for me, or anyone else! We went to bed when dark came, and got up the
next morning when the sun came up.
I don't approve of a lot of the ways that young people do, and there's no
elderly people that do. You don't want to hear what I think of kids today! I
think they don't care. I don't think they have any body pride. Now, I
wouldn't show my knees to nobody, but you all. And I won't have my dress
shorter than my knees. They don't care any more. Now, I'm gonna tell you.
You asked me! They don't care no more about their nakedness. They don't
care as much as Adam and Eve did, 'cause Adam and Eve was ashamed of
their nakedness when they was born. Went and tried to pin fig leaves to-
gether and make aprons to hide their nakedness.
Some changes in the world are good and some are not. Some of it has
degraded people. They don't observe the Sabbath as they should. They
don't take care of their bodies as they should. They don't rely on nobody.
They think they can rely on themselves. It gets 'em to thinking that they
can do anything within themselves, when you can't do that. They used to
rely more on their Maker than they do now. They have learned so much
that they think, "I don't have to call on my Maker." Things won't get bet-
ter, not the way the world's going. I think Judgment Day is close at hand.
I don't believe they went to the moon. I don't know. But I just don't be-
lieve they did. Why the moon is a—I never studied science in my life, I
never did go to school farther than the seventh grade, and I'm glad I got
that much. Children, I'm eighty-three years old. And I never did care for
science. And I read the Good Book, and the Good Book said that the moon
was made to rule the earth and all the heavens therein, fishes of the sea, and

============================================================
PAGE 209
============================================================

212 
FOXFIRE 4
the fowls of the air, and even man's body. And the moon rules the vegeta-
tion. I don't think they landed up there. You just know what they said. And
how do you know but what they carried them rocks with'em? Possibilities
that they did. And if it was made to fool with, it'd been put down in the
reach of man. I believe that, too. 'Cause we know that God created every-
thing.
I think that the world has made great progress, but they's a few things
that I think is money spent foolish. And that is trying to go to the moon! I
don't think that's fair at all. God made everything. He made man to rule
the earth and all the inhabitants therein. And he didn't make the moon for
man to play with. If he did, he'd put it down for man to reach. He'd put it
anyhow where man could get on a stepladder and go up! I don't think that
it's—well, it's just no means! The moon is the moon. Leave it alone!
There's not a thing in the world up there but just the moon. And if they
read the first chapter of Genesis, they'll find out what the moon is—first
and second chapters, I believe it is—they'll find out how God created the
earth. And he made everything. Man was created. The earth was made.
I'm not educated, of course. But it's true. We had it in Sunday School yes-
terday, about the creation.
It took him six days to create all these things. He didn't do it in one day.
And so the moon and the stars—the moon was made to shine at night and
the stars was made to'luminate the sky, and the sun just warms the earth,
that's all it does. But the moon rules the earth. Now you girls that study sci-
ence, don't it teach you that the moon rules the earth? And so, therefore, I
don't think that they ought to be fooling with the moon. There's nothing up
there. And what we see on the moon is the shadow of the earth. You look at
our maps and see the shadow on the moon and see if it ain't just exactly
alike. Don't you think it is? If you don't think it is, don't you agree with
me! Some night when you see a big round moon, you look at that shadow,
and see if it ain't just like the map of the earth.
I don't know nothing about ghosts, nothing about a ghost. In fact, I
never was brought up to hear ghost tales. My daddy said not to tell children
ghost tales. Said it'd make'em afraid. Well, I'm not afraid, but I tell you I
had a sister that wouldn't open a door and go out on the porch and get a
drink of water at the well. She was just afraid of the dark.
I never did know anything about haunted houses and ghosts. They's no
such thing as a haint. It's not a thing in the world but imagination. They
just imagine they hear these things, and they don't hear'em at all. Now this
is not a haunted tale—this is true—I was seven years old when I started
school, and I had to go through these wood over there. And everybody
thought they was haunts in the woods. And over yonder at that old house

============================================================
PAGE 210

where you turn in this way at that barn, Mr. Bleckley lived there, and Mr.
Swafford lived down there. And they had lots of big old brood sows. And if
you caught a pig or made a pig squeal, the sow'd bite you. And they'd say,
"Now, Annie, don't you get out there on the side of the road (them pigs was
on the side of the road) and go through there or them old sows'll eat you
up." Well, they had me afraid of hogs. I'd have to go by myself through
those woods over there—I'd look way out here and way out there; there
wouldn't be a thing in the world. Directly I saw a thing that looked like a
hog. And so I had to go by it, and I was scared. And there wasn't a thing in
the world. Not a thing. They wasn't a hog within a mile of there, just some
stumps a'lying there. But I guess it looked like a hog to me. 'Magination.
That's so now; they scared me with hogs. And I'd look way out, and I'd see
something and I'd make a hog out of it. Now that's the way ghost tales get
started. [There] ain't no ghosts.
I don't read the Bible too much. I read it some. But I don't read it too
much, 'cause I can't. My eyes won't let me. We should read the Bible, be-
cause He gives us knowledge. Your conscience tells you whether you're liv-
ing right or living wrong. If you was to steal something, say my hat—which
you wouldn't do—but if you was to steal my old hat, something inside, a
inner man on the inside, would say you done wrong.
I know one thing. [The Bible] says, "Honor thy father and thy mother
and your days will be prolonged upon the earth which the Lord, thy God,
hath made." And I know another thing it says, "Whatever you sow, that's
what ye also reap."
When Linda was a little girl, she came up here and she wanted me to
read her a Bible story. And I said, "Well, we'll just read the first chapter of
Genesis. Well, I had read it off and on all my life, and that was the first
time I ever read it and got the real meaning. I'd read it, just going along
through. But He didn't make but one thing a day. Had you ever thought
about it? Just one thing. The earth was formed first. It was totally dark and
He made light and He saw it was good—morning and evening. Then He
made the fowls of the air and it was good—morning and evening. And on
till the sixth day. And the sixth day, He was pleased with all He had done.
And He created man, and man needed a helpmate. And He caused Adam
to go into a condensed sleep. And He took a rib from Adam's side and
made Eve. And on the seventh day, He rested. And who does that now?
And He hallowed it and called it the Lord's day.
I'll tell you right now, God didn't intend—I know [in the] olden days, all
the pictures that were made by men—and the Good Book says, "It is a
shame for a man to wear long hair, and a woman's hair is her aura of
glory." It's her glory. But it said a woman shouldn't cut her hair. But it said
it was a shame for a man to wear long hair. And I think they look shameful!

============================================================

They look sorry to me! If I was a youngster going to school, I wouldn't even
look at one that had that shaggy hair as a friend. I'd just cuss him down!
Do you think they look admirable? It just looks so strange—and men
wearing moustaches. Now I don't like that either. It'd be like kissing a
stinging worm.
Religion back then wasn't a bit more important than it is now, but they
did live better than they do now. I believe they was more conscientious
Christians then than they are now. In your reading and going about, don't
you think they were, too? They observed God's laws more than they do
now. You never heard of nobody going fishing on Sunday. You never heard
of anybody going hunting on Sunday. They's breaking the Sabbath. And in
my childhood days, if they took a gun and went squirrel hunting, the neigh-
bors around were the grand jurors. They would prosecute'em for it and
they'd have to pay for hunting on Sunday. Sure did. People used to observe
it much more than they do now. My grandmother was reared in South Car-
olina, and she was Presbyterian. She said they didn't get to cook a thing on
Sunday—not a thing. They cooked up food on Saturday to do till Monday
morning. They made a little tea and that's ever'thing that was done. But
they had to tend to the hogs and cows. But as for cooking, all their food,
they ate it cold. They went to church and if somebody was sick, they went
to visit'em, to see if they could do anything for'em. And if they didn't need
nothing done, they'd come back home. And they stayed at home the rest of
the day.
I cook my Sunday dinner of a morning. I cook my dinner when I cook
my breakfast and if somebody wants to come and eat dinner with me, why
they can, but they eat just like I do. Sometimes I go visiting in the after-
noons, sometimes I don't. Everybody ought to have one day out of seven.
I go to the Methodist church. I walk over there and some of the neigh-
bors bring me back home. But I walk over. I feel like that's too much trou-
ble for anybody to come after me. I walk a mile. That'll keep my legs work-
ing. But I can still make it. I say, "Why not use what God gives you?" I am
thankful that God has seen fit for me to live and be healthy and strong as I
am at the age of eighty-three years. My birthday was the twenty-third day
of May.
I don't know what has caused the difference. I don't know whether
there's more people in the world and more conveniences. Let me tell you.
You know people—they don't think about God giving them wisdom to be
able to do all these things. You don't get no wisdom from the devil. He
don't know nothing. But God, He gave you your life; if He gave you your
knowledge, everybody ought to serve Him. He gives us everything. When
we get in real deep trouble, who can we go to? Who can we call on? He's
Creator and Maker of all.

HORSE TRADING
B
eing a horse owner myself, and
seeing how people trade horses
now, I was curious to find out
what the old-time ways of horse trading were.
I had always sensed that horse traders had bad reputations, but I found
out they're just like anyone else: Some are more honest than others. One
horse trader would take a horse with a lame leg, give it a shot of morphine,
and trade it; another horse trader would cure the horse of lameness, then
trade it.
As I talked to many different traders, I found trading wasn't always as
much of a living as it was an obsession. Once they traded for the first time,
they couldn't stop. Some of the horse traders started trading when they
were children and kept it going until they were fifty and sixty years old.
The old ways of horse trading are just about gone. Today traders trans-
port their horses in big trucks instead of riding one and leading the rest in a,
string. Now they trade primarily saddle horses instead of work horses and
mules. They tend now to go to horse auctions and deal in cash whereas they
used to bring their horses to a person's farm and trade for anything they
could: chickens, cows, guns, and land. However, there are still a few men
here who trade the old-time way, and they really seemed to enjoy sharing
their experiences with us.

Horse trading was kind of a complicated thing—like it is with cars now.
Back in them days, it was horses they looked to instead of cars. If you was
tradin', you'd keep your eye out all of the time all over the country.

A. Teeth are an indicator of horse's age. They may be filed down to
make a horse appear younger than he is. The longer and more protruding the teeth,
the older the horse is. B. Horse's relative age can be determined by the sharpness of
his jawbone; the sharper it feels the older the horse. C. Depression above horse's eyes.
A deep depression shows that the horse is old and/or in poor condition. Some horse
traders would blow it- up with air to make the horse appear younger and better. Also,
if horse has moon blindness, one or both eyes (just below C) will turn white or light
blue for two weeks out of the month when the moon is dark. During this time he is
blind in the affected eye(s). D. Area on face which may turn gray with age. Some
horse traders would dye the hair to make the horse look younger. Also, a broad flat
face means a horse will work. E. Ears are a sign of temperament. A horse with big
ears is more likely to be stubborn. F. Sunken area along side of neck indicates horse is
either overworked or too old to be worked other than lightly. G. Broad chest—sign of
a good worker with a lot of stamina. H. Swinney—when the muscle in the shoulder
deteriorates and the horse can't use the leg. One attempted cure was to slit the skin at
the shoulder and slip in a piece of poke root about as large as a man's little finger.
I. Straight legs—good point of conformation in any horse. The horse is more likely to
remain sound and have smoother gaits. J. Ringbone—a hard gristly growth in the pas-
tern of a horse usually results in lameness and is considered incurable. K. Twirl
—where the hair on the flank of the horse forms a spiral-shaped cowlick. It is a sign of
stamina. L. Area on the rump of an Appaloosa which is likely to be spotted. One horse
trader we spoke to dyed fake spots on the rump of an Appaloosa who didn't have
oiany spots of his own. M. Well-muscled hindquarters indicate that a horse has a lot
of strength. N. Big foot—a desirable quality in a horse used for a lot of plowing. Large
fii-t are less likely to sink in the dirt, and allow the horse to get a better footing.

I was seventeen years old when I started trading horses. I went to see my
brother and I rode a mule that I had just traded for—a young mule
breakin' him to ride. I married when I was twenty-three and I traded up
till I was married and then traded some after I was married. Things were
hard and you couldn't make over seventy-five cents a day, but you get out
and trade horses and you could make two or three dollars a day. Sometimes
you would make ten or fifteen dollars. Then you thought you was getting
somewheres. It's just like today going out and making five hundred dollars.
I'd go to Hiawassee and Blairsville and trade. I'd get on these country
roads and go to barns and go right into the field and unhitch their horses or
mules from the plow and hook mine up.
When I was trading horses, I watched. Everybody farmed and logged be-
cause that was all they had. I knew everybody in the county because I was
always riding.
Say you didn't have a pair that matched up—I'd go off and in a couple
of days, I'd find one and get it so it would match yours. I'd put them to-
gether and talk to you about how they would look and how much you
would trade, and then you'd up and trade some with me. And that was the
way it went.
When I got one, I knew just where to take him and trade him because
I'd already seen a man that had one just like him. I didn't aim to keep any
of them myself. I had pretty'uns and some I couldn't give away. But I'd al-
ways get shed of them some way or other. I knew what to match up with
the man, but all I was trading for was the boot. I'd take cash, chickens,
hogs; anything I could go trade again, I'd take it. And I just kept that stuff
turning around all the time. It was kind of a complicated thing, once you
got into it, but once you did it, you kinda liked it.
Tie two or three ol' horses to one good one and take off up the road.
Sometimes I'd have to stay and talk to a man two or three hours before he
would trade with me.
You could take horses and if you tended to them right, fed'em right and
everything, you could make'em look a whole lot better. Then there were
horses that had what they called the "heaves," and they was the hardest to
trade because they would show up on you. You had to know how to doctor
one till you got shed of him. And [the heaves] would stay down for about a
week or so, and they would come back again. You have to dampen ev-
erything he eats; even his hay, you've got to wet. Then give him a little Jap-
anese oil and give it to him along with the hay. When you do this for a
while, you can get shed of em for a while. When they would breathe, their
sides would go in and out real big. I can stand off a hundred yards and tell
if a horse has got any heaves about him. The Japanese oil worked on his
bronchial tubes some way so he could get his breath, but he couldn't let it

out. They would kind of whistle after a while when they got tired and they
would do it bad. You could hear them a'comin'.
Then some horses had the swinney—that muscle right where his leg starts
across from the bottom, he's got a muscle there. That would perish away.
That muscle will go away and he'll be as slick as a board and he'll limp
when he starts taking swinney. There's nothing you can do about it. It will
just perish away. I never did know what caused a horse to take the swinney.
A lot of horses died with kidney colic. There is a remedy for that. The
bots killed more horses than anything. That's a thing that they take and you
can't do a thing about. They go crazy they hurt so bad. They'll gnaw at
their sides and bite theirselves and they'll wallow and they'll do it again and
again. Finally they'll go so crazy they'll walk through a fence. They don't
pay attention to nothing. They would kill the horse.
Hardly ever could you do anything with a horse if he was lame. I'd al-
ways just tell the man he'd sprung his foot on something—he might get bet-
ter or he might not. I've seen them change their color. They'd get some
paint to make them look good but I never thought it made them look any
better. I have worked on their teeth to make them look younger. That's
what they go by. Looking at their teeth, a man that's ever fooled with
horses can tell their ages any time—if he's ever looked in a horse's mouth
any. They would take their horses and file their teeth some and make them
look younger.
They could pump the holes up with air right above their eyes. There was
a lot of that done to trade horses. They'd stick a needle under the skin
above the eye and pump them up. It was against the law, but they'd do it.
Old man Ferd Burrell, he made a fortune tradin' horses. He owned
Hiawassee at one time. I don't know how much he owned at Franklin. He
died down here at Franklin, but he owned a lot. He had a lot of money in
the bank, they tell me. I've heard people talk about it. I'd knowed him ever
since I was a kid. That's how I got up with horse trading. I got to fooling
around with him. I used to go around with ol' man Ferd. Watch him trade.
Then when I got up big enough, I took his horses and traded them for him.
Then I decided if one man can make money at it, another can. I got
out on my own and you could buy hprses cheap. I got me up two or three
ol' plugs and I started. I've had some real horses, and some that wasn't
worth a dime in the world. Some that you wouldn't have. Look like quilting
frames goin' down the road. But they'd always trade somewhere or another;
they'd always trade. Ferd Burrell used to get horses in by the carload.
Mules that had never been broke. And cash them right for the money. I
went up there with a man that had our place rented for his tent and built
that road from Hayesville to Hiawassee—the first road that ever went
through there. Costella Brothers built it. Ferd seen they was doing it with

mules and things, you know. And he knew that would be a good time for
him to get into mules. He used his head and watched out ahead for things
and he was ready for them. He'd get two hundred dollars a pair for them
mules and he got them for a hundred dollars a pair. But he was sellin' them
like hot cakes. I went with my boss man up there, 'cause I worked with this
man who rented our place. I carried water and when he'd go off, he'd take
me with him and make some other boy carry water.
One of the funniest things that happened was Wayne. (Me and him was
good buddies and he never did trade or he didn't know nothing about
tradin'. So ol' Wayne made a pretty good living so he didn't have to trade
no ways.) I knew him like a book, and I was raised with his wife and I
stayed there most of the time. One time there was an old black man come
ridin' by there and he was ridin' th'poorest old gray horse you ever seen and
it tickled Wayne. It was so poor, Wayne was makin' fun of the horse. So
Wayne and me had went and bought us a big ol' sheep we was going to kill.
We'd kill sheep and calves and go out and peddle them around. We went
over across Hiawassee River there and we'd sell out in just a little bit. You
could buy all [the sheep] you wanted for two and three dollars apiece. And
we'd get six or seven dollars out of that sheep by killing him. We was mak-
ing money peddlin' in a one-horse wagon. And if they didn't have the
money, we'd swap them mutton for a chicken and we could get turkey or
anything. This ol' black guy come by there that day and Wayne, he was
just laughing and going on about that poor horse. You could count every
rib that horse had and his hip bones stuck a way out. It was an ol' white
horse at that and that made it look ugly, you know. So Wayne hollered
something back to him. Wayne said something funny about the horse and
that black man looked back at him and said, "What would you give for
him?"
"I'll give you that ol' sheep tied up there." That black man didn't do a
thing except get off of that horse, come back, tie the horse up, and took that
rope leading his sheep off. Wayne looked at me and said, "Do you reckon
he means that?"
I said, "You damn right he means it. I know ol' Frank Dorsey. When
you've traded with him, you've traded." He was a trader too. I knowed
him. He took the sheep and left the horse there. Wayne begged for me to
take it home with me. I said, "I wouldn't take that thing home with me.
You can't give me that horse."
He said, "What are we going to do with it?" I said, "That's your job,
son, that's your trade." That just tickled his wife to death. But I wouldn't
have nothing to do with it. She said, "He traded for it? You let him trade it
off?"

============================================================

I said, "That's exactly what I'm going to do. I ain't going to have a thing
to do with it."
I stayed busy till about dark and started to go home. Then he said, "No,
I want you to stay with me awhile. I swear I've got to do something with
this horse."
I said, "Well, I'll tell you where you might trade him at. You might trade
him over on Crooked Creek. People over there keeps such horses as that and
you might trade him over there." He says, "Well, we've got to do some-
thing."
So we got up there. We had to go over by Hiawassee and he says to me,
"Lawton, I'll tell you what I'll do. Why don't you ride this thing through
town?" He was ashamed to let anybody see him riding that thing through
town and have people laughing at him. He said, "I'll give you a dollar if
you'll ride it through town for me and let me ride your horse."
I said, "All right." I just got down off mine and got on the old poor
thing and we just went rackin' on up through there. Went over on Crooked
Creek and went up to a place. Now this is what tickled me. This woman
and oP man had this ol' mare and she got so old that she couldn't eat
enough to make her fat. The old mare's name was Bess. They'd had her for
years and years. Well, the funniest thing was he went up and knocked on
the door and this lady came to the door. He asked her where Hicks Mars
was. Hicks was a horse trader. Wayne said he'd just give it away if he could
get anything out of it. She said, "Do you want to trade some?"
Wayne said, "Yeah, I've got a good horse out here I want to trade."
She said, "Bring it out here and let me look at it." So he got the old horse
and led it around the edge of the house where she could see it. She said,
"My God, that's ol' Bess. She's seven years older than God!" I just fell over.
I never laughed as much in my life. He knew he was hooked there. He
couldn't do nothing. He just dropped his head. He said, "What are we
going to do?"
I said, "I don't know what you're going to do, Wayne, but directly I'm
going home." We was about eight miles from home. It was getting late. We
come to a little road up there that a family lived down. When we got to
that little road, Wayne said, "Wait a minute. I'll tell you what I'm going to
do. I'm going to bid ol' Bess farewell."
I said, "What are you going to do?"
He said, "I'm going to turn her loose."
I said, "Well, that's your job." So he took his saddle off. That was one of
those little terrapin-hull saddles. He got it from his daddy-in-law. Those are
the kind of saddles that they ride on these race tracks. That's what I called
them—terrapin-hull saddles.

HORSE TRADING

So he got on my horse behind and took that old horse and led it down
the road and put the bridle reins up around her neck so they wouldn't fall
down and sent her down the road. She went out of sight. Me and him never
did hear tell of that horse anymore. Where that horse went, I don't know.
Some family probably got him down there and probably glad to get him.
But whoever got it had them a horse and didn't cost them a thing.
The funniest thing was I went up to Tusquitty to trade. This man had a
big ol' gray horse and the prettiest mule you'd ever seen. I had this gray I'd
swapped a lady out of on Crooked Creek and it wouldn't work but I didn't
know it. It would kick the devil out of the cross. [When I traded for her
gray horse] I asked if it was a good work horse and she said, "Oh, yeah,
good work horse." I think she was a horse trader, too.
I knew this poor ol' fellow up on Tusquitty; he had this big gray horse
and a good mule, and I thought to myself, "I know where to go. I'll head
for Tusquitty in the morning and I'll know where to place you an order,
good ol' workin' horse." So I went up there and this man was down in the
field gathering corn. I asked his wife where he was and she said, "Go down
that road and you'll find him down in the field."
Well, I started down that road and there was a hill right up to the barn
and I was going down this hill and met him right at the foot of it. I knew
that was the wrong place to talk to him, but that was the only chance I had
so we got to talkin'. He said, "Boy, I like the looks of that horse."
I said, "Yeah, you ought to have this one to go with that one there. And
you'd have a team just nearly alike."
He said, "That's the truth. I've never seen any two match up any better.
How would you like to swap him for that mule?"
Well, I knew I would swap for that mule and if I had to, I'd give him a
little boot. The mule wasn't too old and it was a pretty mule.
We kept on talkin' and he said, "Let me put the harness on him and try
him up the hill." I didn't know what to say. He had me there. I knew if he
hooked him to that wagon, he wouldn't pull a pound, 'cause I hooked him
up to the wagon and he kicked the devil out of it. I beat the devil out of
him, but it didn't do any good. I had to take him loose from the wagon.
He'd walk a step or two and then go to kickin'.
Well, I knew that was what he'd do, but there wasn't a thing I could do.
I studied just a minute and said, "All right." I just thought this trade was
lost. Well, I'll just tell him the folks guaranteed him to be a good workin'
horse to me. Of course, it didn't matter to me if he didn't take him. Some-
one else would. He put that ol' fool to that wagon, and he got up on his
wagon and I just shut my eyes. I just knew he'd kick the front end out of his
Wagon.

============================================================
PAGE 221

FOXFIRE 4
When that other old horse started pulling, he did, too, and they pulled
just as pretty as you please and pulled right up where he unloaded his corn.
"Boy, that's a good horse," he says. "How would you swap?"
I said, "What will you do?"
He said, "I'll trade you that mule."
I studied a minute and says, "I can't hardly do that. I'll swap with you
for five dollars."
He says, "I believe I'll do it." I just took my saddle off of the wagon and
put it on the mule and come on home.
I never went back to trade with the man on Tusquitty after I sold him
that gray horse. I was always ashamed of that trade. I ought not done that.
I still think of that trade a lot of times.
I swapped that mule for the prettiest bay mare you ever laid your eyes on
for fifteen dollars to boot off a gypsy woman. I got that off a bunch of gyp-
sies. They'd come through here every once in a while, and they'd always
park down there at what we called the Herbert Ford. You forded the river
there and it was a big level place and big trees just like a parking lot now.
They'd pull in there and stay for two or three weeks at a time. They had
horses, mules, everything. They were just going through the country trading
with anybody who would trade. I'd get in with them and trade. I traded a
lot with them gypsies. If you had something they wanted, they'd trade good,
but if they didn't want it, you couldn't trade because they'd gyp you. They
had another one to match that mule and they wanted that one bad.
One man I knew had a big red horse, prettiest thing you ever saw and
one of the saddlest things you ever put a saddle on, but that horse was the
worst heaver you ever saw in your life. He would just go in and out, and if
you rode him a piece, you could hear him snort. When he started snorting,
he'd just rock you to sleep and just as pretty and just as fat as I had hoped.
They kept him in a big meadow on grass all of the time. This fellow gave
me the horse—didn't cost me a thing. He couldn't do nothing with him. He
said he tried to trade him but no one would have him so he just gave him to
me. I said, "Well, I'll trade him."
And I was glad to get him, so I headed up on Hog Creek out of Hiawas-
see. This other fellow up there had another big ol' bay horse that this'un
would match and I went up there, and so this ol' man was there and I
asked him about tradin'. He said, "I shore do need that horse there, but I
tell you, son, I shore am short on money right now."
I said, "Well, what have you got to trade? I don't have to have money."
I had me a good saddle horse I was ridin'. I was leadin' that one. I always
kept me one. I always had one picked out for myself. Sometimes I'd trade
for something else. So he studied a minute and said, "I've got some good
hogs. Come on up here and let me show them to you."

============================================================
PAGE 222
============================================================

HORSE TRADING 
225
In that pen he had some hogs. "What about the two hogs there? How
would you like to have them?"
I said, "Well, they're pretty nice-looking hogs," and walked on to look at
the others.
He said, "I'll let you have that one there. Ready to kill, you know."
So I said, "I don't know. I got a pretty nice horse down there in awful
good shape. He's just as fat as he can be."
He had a buggy setting under a shed. I did want that buggy but I didn't
have no idea of getting it. I got that buggy and the buggy harness and ev-
erything, and got that big hog and eight dollars in money off him. Now
that's the truth. I never did feel right over that deal. If that man was living,
if I ever laid eyes on him, I'd give him some money. I never did feel right
because this was an honest old man and a good old man. He says to me, "I
haven't got the eight dollars but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll mail that eight
dollars a'Tuesday and you'll get it a'Wednesday.
I says, "That's all right. I ain't worried about that." So Wednesday I
went to the mail box and sure enough, there it was. That hog would have
been a big price for that horse. The buggy would have been a big price for
the horse, let alone the buggy harness and all of that. I just took the harness
and borrowed a collar from that old man and tied that hog in that little
booth on back of the buggy, tied ropes around him and his feet and went on
home with it layin' on the back a'hollerin'.
I usually traded in the county. Sometimes I'd get off over to Blairsville
and down around Blue Ridge and I'd stay a week at a time. Just stay here
and there and trade horses with people. The biggest tradin' time was when
court was on hand. Well, when court come, everybody rode their stock to
town and they'd tie them up around the edges of the courthouse as close as
they could get. Court then would run a week or two weeks. And that was
the tradin'est place you ever went into.
Of course all of the horse traders in the country was there. OF Hobb
Duvall and all of'em—Ferd Burrell, Will Burrell, Bud Hitchbar. All of the
old horse traders were there. We'd all get in there and trade. Sometimes I
would trade as high as ten times a day. That was your best tradin' was
court week. If they had it at Hayesville, the same way there and Blairsville
the same way. Go around to Murphy. They traded a lot there.
But I made more going out and hittin' up with the old farmers. Of
course they always had some to pay boot with. It may not be money, but
they had hogs or cattle or something that you could take and get the
difference off of. I'd just go to the field one day and match up their team
for them and they'd be pleased with it. I'd get my boot and go on. That's
what I was looking for—the difference.
That horse tradin' is a good trade. I'd like to do it again. I wish horses

would come back, but they ain't enough around. They don't farm with
horses; they do it with tractors.
You couldn't do no tradin' now at all. All you'd find now is one some-
body wanted to ride. If you could get one to suit somebody to ride, you'd be
all right. If you didn't, you'd just have some horses on your hands to feed
for nothing. But back then, they was working them. They had to have
something to work to make anything. If you had a team, you could get out
there and get a job logging or hauling for somebody and make money.
That's what they were looking for. I'd always rig them up a team some
way. In trading, you have to keep your eyes open and you have to know,
too. You can't just start today in the business. You've got to get out over the
country and you've got to know who's got what and what you think you
need. Then go back and see them again. If you ever get started, there is
somebody after you every day. They was a dozen at the house all the time
I was gone, tellin' my daddy to tell me to see them; that they needed some
kind of a horse. They wanted to know what you had. What you do, it kept
you busy as a telephone operator. Once you get on the line, you really like
it. I had fun.
"I don't care what you're trading, you better trust
your own judgment."
KENNY RUNION
There was a fellow come by one mornin'. I was quite young. I don't
guess I was over sixteen, seventeen years old. He said, "I want to trade
some with you." He was a horse trader and I knowed him. He said, "I've
got a horse an' buggy."
I said, "How old's your horse?" I didn't know no more about how old a
horse was than a thing in the world.
"Well," he said, "he's comin' nine year old."
I said, "That ain't old." He said he was round and sound and nine year
old. I had some good steers, and a wagon. He said, "I'll tell you what I'll
do. I'll swap with you for twenty-five dollars."
Well, my mother couldn't get around, and I had a brother who couldn't
get around, and I thought it would be an advantage to get somethin' for
them to ride in. We stayed around there a while in the evenin', and I finally
said, "I believe I'll just trade with you."
Now he got away with me. Well, I kept that horse around there a while,
and he wouldn't work. So I decided to go to Hiawassee to see Ferd Burrell,
an old horse trader; he's dead now. I rigged that horse up and took him
down there. I said, "I've got a young horse I want to trade you for a mule."

============================================================

HORSE TRADING
227
PLATE 244 Kenny tells us some of his horse-trading adventures.
He said, "I'll be glad to trade with you if you've got a young horse."
I said, "The fellow I got him from said he was young."
He looked at him, shook his head and said, "No, I wouldn't have him if
you give him to me. He's twice nine, then some!"
Doggone, I was beginnin' to get disheartened. He wouldn't trade with
me at all. I rode him back and put him in the stable.
One day a fellow came by, an old friend of mine—I reckon he was a
friend of mine. He said, "Tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a dollar if
you'll take me to Blue Ridge."
I said, "I've got a horse that'll take you all right." [It was the same horse
Ferd Burrell wouldn't trade for.] He had a sack with somethin' in it, and I
never asked any questions. Well, I said, "I'll just gear up and take you."
I hitched that horse to the buggy, and me an' him started. We got a little
out of the settlement, and he said, "I believe I'll take a drink." It was in a
Jug and you couldn't tell how much you was a'drinkin'. Then I took the
Jug, turned it up, and it was pretty heavy. After a while, he says, "Whoa.
Let's have another drink!" When we got to Blue Ridge, I tell you, I was just

about out of business. I was as drunk as a man ever gets. I guess we drunk
half a gallon, three quarts, since the time we started. He went on this away,
and I went back that away. Some folks met me there in Blue Ridge, and
they said I was standin' up in that buggy whippin' that horse, and the road
was straight down. I really broke that buggy down. Well I finally got home,
and I seen I had to do somethin' with that horse. He wouldn't plow, barely
move. So I rented a pasture; it was pretty high, too. Let him stay in there
till fall, I decided I'd go down and look at him. He was just a sore all over
nearly, hardly any hair. I don't remember what they called it that was
wrong with him. I told my daddy, "You can have that horse if you'll go get
him." He went and got him, brought him home, and the horse died.
So I lost about two hundred dollars on that swap. I got stuck on that one.
All I got out of them steers and wagon was that one dollar I got to drive
that man to Blue Ridge and all the liquor I could drink.
Horse traders will tell people false. I don't care what you're trading, you
better trust your own judgment. They're out to trade. They won't give the
age of a mule as over seven years, and a horse just nine. That's as far as
they'll tell you. I've had some mules that wasn't no 'count. With one mule I
had, it took one to lead the mule, one to hold the plow, and one to drive
and whip. He wasn't worth a blame for nothin'. More money gone. Got
another'un. He'uz still worse. Got another one; when you'd open the door,
he'd go to kickin', and you couldn't get in that stable to save your life. He'd
kick with both hind feet. I bet he didn't miss my head three inches. Boy,
you better watch on horse swappin'. You shore had, or you'll lose what you
have in a few minutes. You can't go back once you've made a deal. I've put
out some money buyin' all them mules. I had one pretty good old mule. He
was club-footed, and I swapped a stove for him. Fellow was tellin' me the
truth there. He'd work.
"These horse traders here, you better look out, or
you'd get home with a rope and your horse gone."

horses up; they're all trained but they're not able to go." Most of them
were old and their teeth were all filed down He'd take those horses out and

know, a horse's crown runs out when he gets twelve years old. He ain't got
no crown. Well, he had that all filed out just as pretty as can be. He fixed
it all back and had them horses down there, but they can't eat good for a
day or two. So they fixed those old plugs up and I shod them. I didn't say
nothing. It wasn't nothing to me. Old Joe said, "We made a thousand
dollars yesterday with [some of] those old plugs."
I said, "What are you doin' with those horses—they're all to pieces."
He said, "We're feedin' them dynamite. We give them a teaspoon of dy-
namite and they're just like a colt for eight or nine hours. By that time
we've already got our money and we're finished."
Take them out on the road and they fall all over theirselves; get their legs
tangled up. They sold I don t know how many old plugs. They cleaned up
there for a while, about two years till they run out.
Old man L.M. had to leave here, he got so far along that people

listenin'. I told her I would look around and see if I could find them two. I
knew of several but I didn't know if a man could buy them. "Oh," he said,
"we'll buy them if you can locate them."
Just as soon as I quit talkin' L.M. jumped in. He said, "I've got any-
thing you need."
She said, "What have you got?"
He said, "I've got them right across the street over by the railroad. We
got sixteen head down there and I guarantee any one of them."
So I knew right then that he might get that woman killed. He didn't give
a durn just so he got the money. They were fixin' to go over and his wife
was out there talkin' to him and her husband come on in where I was and I
told him, "You're foolin' with a man who don't have no heart for nobody
but himself. He's got horses over there that are okay, but the rest are no
good. They'll kill you."
"Well," he said, "I'm glad you told me. We're no riders. We just wanted
tame horses we could crawl on and take our time."
I said, "I'd never buy nothing from him." So they went over there and
looked at them, and the old man said, "We'll take them over and let the
caretaker saddle and ride them before we get on them."
Well, they took two over there and it wasn't more than an hour and they
come back. I knew right then what had happened. See, the horse knew
more about saddling than the man did. The horse knew who he could out-
wit and if it was a kid, he knew he could throw him. So they brought the
horses on back.
[Another time] some fellow come in there and had a horse with a jaw
tooth ground off to the side. And he said, "I want that jaw tooth pulled."
Old man Joe looked up at me and said, "That tooth has got to come out."
I said, "You can't pull it."
He said, "We'll pull it. We'll get some money out of that." It was old
man Rosie's horse. It was one of those French horses, a big saddle horse. He
said, "We'll take him right here and put him right to sleep. We'll get your
drill-bit and drill a hole down into his jaw and take a punch and knock that
tooth out."
I said, "Yeah, you'd better sterilize those drills and punch before you do
that."
He said, "Aw, there's nothing to that. I've did it a'many a time."
I said, "If you kill that horse, you'll go to the chain gang, because now
that man has money and he doesn't want that horse bloodied up like that."
I let him have the bit and he went out and put him to sleep and laid him
down on a load of hay and drilled his jaw. R.M. run the drill. They did it.
An hour went by and he had never come to. I said, "You either gave him a

big dose or something's wrong. That horse should have come to in thirty
minutes."
He said, "He"s comin', he's comin'." They gave him a shot of something
else. I don't know what it was. And the horse raised on up. He was bleedin'
pretty bad and he gave him another shot. The fellow come and looked over
the horse and put the saddle on him and took him home. Old man Rosie
lived over at Five Points and told him, "Don't ride him. Just put him in the
stable."
Well, he got on home and fed him that night, but he wouldn't eat noth-
ing. And the next morning, the horse laid down out in the orchard and died.
They got the vet from Clemson College up there and he told them the horse
died from blood poisoning.
There were a lot of horse traders fifty years ago, but they didn't belong
here. A horse trader don't stay long in a town, because he knows it isn't wise
to. They'd come and stay about thirty days and leave. Then another one
would come and take his place. They swap around. We had one here from
Mississippi. He bought a place up here in the valley. He had a whole string
of horses that he brought with him. I was about sixteen or eighteen years old
then. I come on down with my daddy. Daddy wanted to buy a horse that
was broke to a one-horse wagon and we went on up there. He was a nice
old fellow, stayed there by himself. He lived in a shack and had the horses
loose. They were pickin' in and around the strawberries. Daddy went out
and looked at them, and he had a little copper-bottomed mare there, pret-
tiest thing you ever looked at—weighed about eight hundred pounds. He
said, "I'll guarantee her to work anywhere."
Daddy said she was a little small. He said, "Well, I got a bigger one out
there." I told Daddy, "That durn thing is mean [the big horse]. It snapped
at me as I went by a little while ago."
He said, "This horse here is hard to bridle, but that's all. If you can get
the bridle on, you have got it made." So I told Daddy to leave it alone. I
said, "That little horse out there will do all the plowing we want." He
wanted a small animal. He didn't want a big animal. He bought her for
two hundred dollars and we took her on home and she was perfect.
Come a bunch from Highlands over there, and out of the whole bunch
there wasn't but six that would work a'tall. Rest of them would kill you.
When you opened the door, they would turn around and kick you with both
feet. They were doped when you got them, and when you got home with
them, they'd be almost normal, but when you got up in the morning, you
better look out. There is all kinds of tricks.
They would trade for saddles and things like that. They get something
out of it. These horse traders here, you better look out, or you'd get home

with a rope and your horse gone. I know of a dozen people who went down
there and swapped a durn good animal off just because he had a little age
on him, and got home with one that would kill you. Wouldn't ride no-
wheres, wouldn't work nowheres. That's the kind of stuff they had.

[My father ran a store on Scaly] and people would [come from] all over
just to get the cider he sold; it was just a flavored-up drink. You could get
peach and apple, and it sold for five cents a glass. Well, they was going to
have a horse-swappin' convention at my daddy's store. They had a full
thirty-gallon barrel of this cider and they drew out about three gallons, and
then filled that jug back up with whiskey. Well, there wasn't none left after
the convention.
My father's place was just a wide place in the road. The men-folks were
the only ones there and the biggest per cent of them would get drunk. Some
of them were pretty bad to drink too much. Sometimes they'd have a fight
over the age of a horse and sometimes they'd have horse races. They'd
gather in and maybe come from as far as Asheville, you know, just way off
that way. Some of them would be on the road two or three days before they
got there. And then trade horses on the way. And some of them just went

through the country just trading horses. You traded with them, you got
beat. They'd get out and say, "I bet you a dollar my horse will outrun
yours." They never did bet over two or three dollars. 'Course back then five
dollars was money. I believe five dollars was the most I heard of them bet-
tin'.
Sometimes when a horse was a little stiff, they got them out and got a
whip and made them go around and around till they got them all livened
up. Lots of times in the morning, a horse would be stiff. Those spavins was
nothing but arthritis and they'd get those sores around where they wore
their collar. Sometimes you'd cut a hole out in the pad in the collar to pro-
tect a knot or sore on their shoulder. All work horses had a knot on their
shoulder where that bone come out.
Some of these horse traders were very slick—they could make money.
And of course there was a lot of poor fellows that got beat, that didn't
know.
The gypsies used to go through here trading horses. Nobody ever did
trade with them that didn't get beat. I haven't seen any gypsies go through
here in twenty or more years. First they went through drivin' horses and
then came the secondhand cars. They used to camp over here at Rabun
Gap where the post office is. They used to have that place covered up
there.
It doesn't matter where you go, you'll always find someone who'll cheat
on horse tradin'. At that time, they judged a horse by his teeth. They had a
float [file] they called it, which they put in the horse's mouth and they come
right along there and filed the horse's teeth off. It'd make the horse look
younger. And some of them would have a spavin [knot on their leg] and
get crippled. They'd shoot novacaine in the spavin and it would last for sev-
eral hours. And then they'd feed them gun powder and different things like
that to pep them up. They'd give them the gun powder in with their feed.
But I think that was mostly superstition, because I don't think gun powder
had any effect on them.
Now there are what they call wind-broken horses [also called heavers],
and weavers. They run a horse till it would almost bust their lungs, you
know. Well, when they got to going a little ways, they'd go to heavin' and
just fall down. That's what they called heavin'. And the weavers; when you
took them out to plow, they'd have fits and they just go 'round and 'round.
They called that a weaver. After you worked them awhile, they looked all
right.
With a horse that wears a harness, where the trace chains are, the hair
gets worn off and also on the shoulder where the collar rubs. If you didn't
have these signs, it wouldn't be a work horse. And with a saddle horse, look
for the signs of the saddle. And the next thing, you examine their teeth. Be-

fore you buy a horse, rent it for a little while and if it is a heaver or weaver,
you catch it there. Another thing, you want to pick, up one's foot and see if
it can be shod. Lots of horses won't let you shoe them. And you can notice
where a horse has wide or narrow hips. A narrow-hipped horse is bad to
kick.
Another thing—in mountain sections, people didn't want too heavy a
horse. These draft horses like Clydesdales are too big. People back in the
mountain sections were more likely to have mules, and here [in the bottom
land] were more likely to own horses.
You didn't keep a horse or a team much after it passed nine years old. At
that age, it was usually counted a nag and slipped off on somebody.
We usually kept a team of young mules. We had a couple of mares we
kept in the pasture, and raised our own mules and trained them. Sometimes
they were hard to work. A mule is more dangerous than a horse.
Most of the horses we had we raised. My daddy got cheated by horse
traders a time or two. Horse tradin' was just a way to make a livin' like
these cattle traders. We had some that were honest and some that wasn't. It
was like any other business. In any business you got somebody that's going
to find a way to take advantage of you.
"I didn't play any tricks; I'd let them be the judge
of what they thought."
THAD "HAPPY" DOWDLE
I used to swap horses lots. I'd buy a horse, maybe have two-three more,
tie'em together, hit the various settlements in the country, and swap. And I
made some money—that's the way I made what little I had. If I came
along and you had two-three yearlin's, or a cow or two you wanted to sell,
I'd buy'em if I could see I could make a dollar or two. I made money all
the time.
When I got one that was pretty old, I'd take a rasp and file his teeth
down till he could eat. He'd put on more weight, and his teeth wouldn't be
s'long, as long teeth is a sign of an old horse. It'd make'em look younger.
Sometimes I'd blow up the hollow above the eye of an old horse. The older
the horse, the deeper the hollow. I'd take a needle and stick it in there
under the skin and blow air in there with a little old hand pump—puff it
up. It would stay puffed up for a good while, but it'd finally go back down.
I didn't play any tricks; I'd let them be the judge of what they thought.
I'd take a rag and some good oil and rub the horse down with it, and the
hair'd be all layin' in place, slick as they are after they shed. And I'd take
shears and trim the mane and trim the tail, and sometimes I'd shear his ears

if he had ol' long hair in his ears. I'd also trim up the hooves and put new
shoes on'em. [To make a lame horse appear sound] I used to have a little
dope and I'd give'em a load of it—linseed oil'r'somethin'—just rub it on
there. And if the horse had a corn, I had a blue ointment to rub on it, and
it'd heal up in just a little.
[To make an old or lazy horse look spirited] you can get you a little dope
and put it in it, morphine or something. He'll be lively then. Just like a
man! You see an old dead man a'draggin' around, and in two days maybe
he'll be climbin' the fence if he had a good dose of dope. He'd climb that
fence'r'jump it maybe.
I used to use shoe polish on a horse to change his color. Take a little brush,
coat him with it. Shore did look good, but you didn't want to put too much
on him, just enough to turn the color of him. And I used to use some kind
of blue ointment on where they were turnin' gray around the eyes and such.
There was a fellow that lived in my settlement—he tried to swap horses
all the time, too, and I got from him the prettiest little horse you ever
looked at nearly. And F thought I'd made a good trade—got him pretty

cheap, swapped for another'un. I took him home and put him up that
night. The next mornin' when I went out to water'im, he was blind as a
bat. He couldn't see a thing in the world! I said, "Well, I'm fixed now." So
I fixed him up as good as I could. There was gonna be a fair, so I went up
there, and a fellow had a pretty good mule. I rode up into the yard at the
schoolhouse, and he said, "Where'd you get that horse?"
I said, "There ain't no use askin' me that."
He says, "Why not?"
I says, "That wouldn't make no difference about where I got him; I've
got him."
He says, "I've got a good mule out here I'll swap you for that pony. I'd
love to have him."
I says, "Well, if you want him bad enough, you can git him."
We went on out there and looked at his mule, and he said, "How much
do you want to swap?"
I said, "You git on that horse an' ride'im out the trail there an' back." I
thought maybe surely he'd see that he was blind. But no, he rode him out
there, loped him back, and said, "I'll give you a ten-dollar bill and that
mule for him."
I said, "Just make it twenty and take him on with you."
He said, "Well, that's a little too much."
I said, "If you think it is, don't do it." That's the way I'd do, if I think
it's too much, I don't trade. He got back on him and rode him back out
there again. I thought, "Well, if you had any sense at all, you'll see how he
is." He didn't, and we traded. Well, the next morning before I ate break-
fast, somebody was peckin' at the door at home. My dad stepped to the
door, and it was the man I'd traded the horse to. He said, "Where's Thad
at?"
My dad said, "He's down at the barn, I guess."
So here he come down to the barn. He says, "You know you put a blind
horse on me?"
I said, "Well, yeah, I knowed it."
He says, "What's your idea?"
I said, "To get shed of it!"
He says, "I'm going t'town and take a warrant for you."
I said, "I don't care if you take a dozen for that. Anytime you buy some-
thing and you look it over and don't see that there's anything wrong with it,
well, the trader ain't responsible. It's you who's tradin' for it."
I was comin' home from Toccoa. I was down there on the creek and it
come a snow. I had a boy helpin' me, us both on a horse and a couple more
horses in between. He was riding behind'em and I was ridin' in front of'em.
Well, we crossed the creek and there was another creek comin' down that

way, and the creek made kind of a bend, way off the road, and plumb
around. We camped there one night, and in the night this big old yellow
dog trotted between our tent and the road. It was nearly dark, and I just
thought it was somebody passin' by. Well, he went on and here he come
trottin' back. I had a little old shotgun in the tent and I said to myself, "I'll
just see who you are when you come back again."
Well, here it come back again. I said to the boy with me, "Shall I kill
him?"
And he said, "No, let's just let'im go." Near where we were camped was
a laurel thicket on each side of the road.
I said, "Take your pistol and step out there and see if you can find any-
body." He eased out, and directly I heard his gun go off. And they was just
a'tearin' them bushes down to get out of there. They'd followed us plumb
out of town to get to rob us that night. And would of done it if we'd a'been
in the tent asleep. I'd sold all of my produce, and all but two or three of my
horses, and shucks, they'd have got three or four hundred dollars from me,
plus what the other boy had, about two or three hundred dollars.
"I wouldn't take nothin' in the world for the
experience I got tradin' horses."
HOB DUVALL
The first horse I ever owned was a jack. I was eight years old, and I
bought him with money that I got together from tradin'. I started tradin'
from—I'd say five years old or six—pencils, knives, what have you. So I
saved my money till I had fifteen dollars, and I bought me a jack. But my
father, a Baptist preacher, didn't want me to have this jack, so I carried
him off to a barn quite a ways from where we lived. When he got out Sun-
day morning to start his circuit [four churches], the jack started brayin',
and he wanted to know whose that was. Finally I had to say it was mine.
"Well," he said, "if you'll go to church, and be a good boy and go to school,
I'll let you keep him." The temptation was so great for me to get to ride
that jack and drive him to a little old two-wheel cart, that Sunday I put in
the whole day with him. When he come home Sunday night, naturally my
mother told him what all had happened. He said, "Take that back." That's
the only time I've ever went back on a real bargain. It like to have killed me
to have to take that jack back. This old boy wouldn't give me my money
back, so he kept the money and the jack, too.
The next horse I got from an old horse trader from Hiawassee. This
horse had a kidney colic and had been down for a day or two. It had rained
and run in mud all around him, and the mud was about knee deep, and the

============================================================

trader picked up an axe and was gonna kill him. I said, "Please don't kill
that horse. Give him to me."
He said, "You can't do nothin' with him."
I said, "Give him to me an' I'll show you." Well, I got me a block and
tackle, put a bunch of sacks under him, tied ropes to it where I could brace
him, and pulled him up. In about two hours, I had him to where he could
stand, and that evenin' late, I led him home. In less than a week from then,
I was workin' him. Then I started tradin' on that one. When I was eight
years old I swapped three or four times, and I got a mare who was gonna
have a colt, and I was gonna raise the colt. I carried her to a pasture, and
another horse kicked her and broke her leg, and that was the end of that
story. I've been tradin' horses ever since.
I worked for a man from Texas for five winters, and he shipped as high
as fifty mules at a time to Atlanta, and I'd meet him there, and then we'd
circuit ride. One time I didn't have nobody to help me, and I had twenty-

seven head of horses and mules in Lula, Georgia. I led them from Lula to
Carnesville. I tied them three abreast, then I'd tie this one to the tail ahead,
and when one would start, why, here they'd go. Well, I was ridin' a big
gray horse, twelve to fourteen hundred pounds, and I tied a hitch to the
saddle horn and got'em started, and went. Then they wasn't nothin' but
T-model Fords. You'd pass maybe the mailman, or somebody now and
then, but you wouldn't pass a dozen cars in a whole day. You couldn't do
that today.
I want to tell you one on me an' Frank Rickman. I pulled up over there
with a load of horses one day, and I had a four-year-old palomino horse on
the truck, and Frank said, "Take that horse off. I want to see him."
I said, "Listen, Frank, this horse is four years old and half spoiled. He's
mean."
He said, "Rcoster'll ride him."
I said, "Listen, Frank, I tell you this horse is mean! Don't put that child
on him." He grabbed him up and started to put him on the horse. I said,
"If you want him rode, you get on him."
Well, he reached back, picked up a big old parade saddle, throwed it on
the little old horse; he just bowed up. A saddle has a keeper on the back
cinch, keeps it from goin' back on his flanks. Anything will buck if you put a
rope around their flanks—it tickles'em an' they shore will buck. When he
swung into the saddle, that keeper slipped back and hit'im on the flank, an'
that horse just went straight up with all four feet, like he was on springs. I
seen when he hit the ground, Frank's face turned red. It knocked the breath
out of him, he come down with such power. The next time he went loose,
when he hit the ground, Frank's both feet flew out of the stirrups and he
threw Frank high enough to where he kicked him twice before he hit the
ground, kicked him on both sides of the knees and then the bottoms of the
feet. Frank said, "I felt my shoe heels go through the top of my head!"
I've raised my family by tradin' horses. I tried to farm. My wife was
raised at Clairmont, Georgia, and when her daddy passed away, why he
give her a little farm, and we lived there for twenty years. But I never made
a dollar in my life farming. I'd lose money. But my wife loves a farm. One
time when we were living in Clairmont, I went to the Nacoochee valley,
driving a mule and a horse. I traded two, three times, and when I swapped
with one man, I got a load of corn and a shotgun in the boot. Then I got a
load of hay. And I come down the road and swapped this shotgun for a sow
and a bunch of pigs. I put them pigs in a sack, tied them to this ridge pole
that was holding the hay down, and when I come through Cleveland, I
swapped this horse I'd been a'tradin' on. But I still had a big old mule
hooked to the wagon. I got a cow for the horse, and tied her to the back of
the wagon. Here I come down the road drivin' that mule, put two lines on

him, put two tongue chains up here in the breast chain, and that mule
pulled a whole load of corn and hay, and that cow, sow, and pigs.
One time I went off and swapped my horse for a cow and a heifer. And
the man said, "How in the world will you get your saddle home?"
Well, I said, "I'm gonna put it on that cow." Well, I put this saddle on
my cow, and you never saw such buckin' in all your life. Well, I held on
t'her, finally got her to where she'd carry the saddle, and I tied this heifer
that wasn't even broke to the horn of the saddle and here I come down the
road, and her a'pullin' back, once in a while takin' a notion to run away.
I was tradin' mules in Cleveland. I had a barn full of'em, and this man
lived in Batesville. I loaded four mules on the truck, and drove up there in
the mud. When I got there, he began to find fault with every one of'em,
and they were four good young mules. This one wasn't right, or that one
wasn't right. It was cold and rainy, and I couldn't trade with him, and I
said, "You don't know where a man could get a little liquor, do you?"
He said, "Oh, yeah, I've got plenty of liquor."
I said, "How 'bout gettin' me a quart of it?" and I give him a dollar and
a half for a quart of whiskey. Well, there was an old boy with me, and we
took two or three drinks of that, and goin' back down the road, I said, "I'm
gonna fix this old man. He caused us all this trouble. I'm gonna trade with
him, and he'll remember he's been traded with when I get through with
him."
So we go to Atlanta and buy a big old pair of mares that was as old as I
was, or older; one of'em was gray-headed, but I had their manes cut off,
and trimmed'em up, and they looked pretty after I got'em cleaned up, and
I give only sixty dollars for the pair. Well, I went back to that man's the
next time and told him, "You said you wanted a pair of mares—here's a
pair of mares."
He said, "Pull your wagon out here and let's look." He commenced
talkin', "You needn't commence tryin' to hook'em. I'm gonna trade fer'em
just like they are."
I said, "Okay." Then I said, "I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'll swap
with you for seventy-five dollars. If you don't want to do that, I haven't got
time to fool with you."
He said, "I'm gonna trade," and jerked out his pocketbook and counted
out the money. I said, "I want a gallon of whiskey this time." I knew he
was gonna come back. He didn't have any principles. I've always been this
way; a poor man I was sorry for him 'cause I was always poor m'self. But
when a man had plenty—that's where I always tried t'make my money—
off somebody who had it t'spend. I knew he was comin' back, and I paid
him for that gallon of liquor. I told him I was gonna law him, and I said,

============================================================
PAGE 238
============================================================

HORSE TRADING 
241
"If you want to go to court, I'm gonna bring that gallon of whiskey in and
let you pay for sellin" liquor."
That just slapped him just like that, and he went home and ain't said
nothin' to me yet. Well, he crooked me, he let me make two trips up there,
and I seen he didn't have no principles; he was a big liquor man, had
plenty of money, so I decided I'd even up with him.
Why, I've had people to come back and want to fight and everything
else. Right here at Clayton, I sold a horse to a man for four hundred'n
fifty dollars at the horse show, to a man in Marietta. And this horse had
taken a blue in the show. He paid me two hundred down and owed me two
hundred and fifty. He was to come Tuesday to get the horse. He pulled up
Tuesday like he said, and then said, "I've decided I wouldn't take that
horse."
"No," I said, "you can't make that kind of a decision."
He said, "Yeah, oh yeah, I want my money back."
I said, "I don't have your money, I've got my money. You bought this
horse fair and square."
He said, "Well, I'm gonna law you about it. We'll just take it to court."
I said, "Okay, we'll have to go to Rabun County to try it because that's
where the crime was committed if they's been any crime."
Well, he had a man with him and his boy. We fussed around and you'd
think we was gonna fight, but we didn't. Anyway, he said, "Come on, get
up in the truck with us and let's talk it out."
I told my wife, "Bring my gun out here. I may have to kill these two
__'s, but I'll do that before I take this horse back. You're gonna
pay me now."
He said he didn't have the money, and I said, "I'll tell you what I'm
gonna do. I'm gonna take your check, and if you don't pay me, I'll kill you
for two hundred and fifty dollars."
You know what he done? He wrote me a check and took that horse. My
wife was really a lady, but I was mad. Mad enough to cry almost. Oh, I've
had some awful times in my day.
I was travelin' once, and I had a blue-eyed mule. At a certain time of the
month, that mule'd go blind, maybe two weeks out of every month, when
the moon got on the dark side. This mule's eyes would turn white. She was
just five years old, and the prettiest mule you ever looked at. This man, I'd
tried to trade with him two, three times, old fellow Allison, and I couldn't
never trade with him. I come by there around three or four P.M. on the
truck, and I said, "Listen, I'm a'goin' over to Hiawassee and Blairsville,
and here's a mule that I don't want to trade. If you've got a good mule like
this, that's the one they want. I'm gonna pay you to leave her here with

you. I may be gone two, three days." I just took her off and put her in the
barn. I knew when I left her that he'd hook that mule when I got gone, for
I knew she'd work anywhere—she'd ride, do anything you'd want her to
do. But I knew then at a certain time, she'd go blind again. So I went on,
then come back by, said, "Well, I come t'pick up m'mule."
Well he said, "Wait a minute, I want to swap for this mule."
I said, "What have you got to trade?" He showed me a mare and colt. I
said, "I'm gonna swap with you for a hundred dollars."
"Oh," he said, "I ain't gonna give that much for her. I'll give you fifty-
dollars and the mare and colt."
"Well," I said, "I ain't got time to fool with you. I'm gonna swap with
you." So he just paid me the fifty dollars, and I traded the mare and colt,
and I just walked straight across the road, and sold the mare to a logger.
Kept the colt. Anyway, I knew that he'd be back when that mule's eyes
went bad, and here he come. So I swapped him a mare. He was a great big
old tall man. This mare would work anywhere, but when you hooked her to
a plow, she'd lay into the harness as hard as she could go. That time he give
me fifteen dollars for the boot. So it wasn't no time, and here he was back
again, and he said, "That mare is just s'fast that I can't keep up with her."
I said. "Well now, if you can't keep up with her, you know good and
well there ain't no use for me or nobody else to try her, 'cause you're long-
legged, and if you can't keep up with her, it'd be impossible for me. I'm
gonna have to have ten dollars to boot and swap you for somethin' else."
Seems like I traded him a mule this time. I said, "I've got t'have something
for the gas for this truck. You'll have to give me ten dollars for the boot
here to buy the gas."
He said, "That's what's gotten me into all this trouble is this gas you've
been handin' me!"
I've traveled with every gypsy on the road. A gypsy will fight you if
you've done him wrong. When you done the right thing, you stand up to a
man. I don't care, let him be a murderer or what, he ain't gonna hurt you.
You can take the meanest man in the world and if he tells you a lie, you can
face him and say, "You're telling a lie." And he'll swallow it. Now that's
somethin' I learned from the gypsies. When somebody does you wrong, if
you stand up to their face, they've done you wrong, they'll take it. If they
haven't, they won't take it. That's just a higher power that makes that hap-
pen, I reckon. Those gypsies was the smartest horse traders in the world.
Most of'em carried their wives and families with'em. Well, they'd sell lace
they'd bought in the five and dime store. It's hard t'feed a bunch of horses
and travel. Well, them women would get out and swap that lace for
somethin' t'eat. They swapped with ever'body that would trade with them.
They always conic to the mountains in the summer, and when the cotton

begin t'open up, they'd go south in the winter, and spend the winters in
south Georgia. They were money-makers; none of'em got any education,
but they were smart people. Smart! They were Irish! They could sell any-
thing. They'd never get discouraged. They'd talk to you for two hours, get
vour confidence the first thing, just play along with you, that they were your
friend, that they'd do anything in the world for you; then when they got
your confidence, then they'd cheat you. Then they'd ask you an unrea-
sonable boot. Well, you'd offer maybe half, then they'd trade with you. But
they're really smart people.
Then I began to follow these [summer] camps. I'd get horses for these
kids at these girls' camps. I've had two or three boys' camps, but that would
break the federal government, because them old boys'll run your horses to
death. After they quit row-cropping, I went t'using horses around these
camps. I've [supplied horses for] as high as five camps at a time. But it got
to where you couldn't make no money at that. You had to buy these horses
in the winter, and you'd buy three horses and get one, maybe two, that you
could use. These kids can't ride, and they's very few of the instructors
knows much. I've had'em turn down horses an' [I'd] just pick'em up here
and move'em over to the next camp and them just be tickled t'death
with'em. If the kid falls off, you just blame the horse, don't you see? You'd
have them horses t'winter, start buyin' around the first of the year. They
wouldn't use'em until June, and you had to feed'em all that time. I'd go to
Atlanta, buy a load of horses; there'd be two or three of'em have a cold,
and it'd go through the bunch of horses. I bet I've spent two or three hun-
dred dollars a year on penicillin to knock the cold out of'em. It was expen-
sive, but I'd get a hundred and twenty-five dollars a horse. I bought one lit-
tle horse for a twenty-dollar bill, but he was poor. He reeled as he walked. I
put him in a stall and covered him with an old quilt, and kept him in for
two months, and when I took him out, he'd got in pretty good shape. I
carried him up to the camp, and got a hundred twenty-five dollars for him.
I used him for two summers at a hundred twenty-five, and I sold him to a
little girl there at the camp for two hundred fifty. But it's a rough-and-tum-
ble game, kind of like a gambler, you make it today and lose it tomorrow.
Had a little horse that was an awful good work horse—snow white, a
Pretty little horse. Well, this old man come and wanted to buy him, and
wanted to know would he work. I said, "Sure." And I put the harness on,
hooked him to the plow, just reached up, pulled the bridle off of him, hung
it on the hames, said, "Gee," and "Haw," and he'd mind me just like my
little dog.
He said, "What do you ask for him?"
I forget what, seems like a hundred and a quarter. Anyway, I priced
him, and he bought him. But when he went to pay me for him, he said,

============================================================
PAGE 241
============================================================

244 
FOXFIRE 4
"What's the matter with this horse?" I said, "Well, he's got a nickel's worth
of heaves."
He said, "What's that?"
And I said, "It's just like anybody with asthma, but if you'll keep his feed
wet, water his hay and the grain you give him, he'll go on and do a good
day's work."
It was two or three weeks after that before I seen him. He said, "Just
how many heaves can you get for a nickel?"
I said, "You can buy a oat sack full of heaves. Why?"
He'd tell that on me. He'd get me in a crowd and he'd tell, "Swear and
be damned, you can't catch him in a lie. He sold me a horse and told me it
was a nickel's worth heavey, and he was bad heavey. The next time I seen
him, I asked him how many heaves you could get for a nickel, and he told
me you could buy a oat sack full!"
You could tranquilize a horse. If you've got a mean horse that you can't
do anything with, you can give'em a tranquilizer. They're about the same
as a man two-thirds drunk. If you've got a horse that wants to buck, give
him a tranquilizer and he'll go along with you, and you can get shed of
him. Put him to somebody that thinks they're smart, and let them have the
trouble with him.
If you've got a horse with ringbone around the front feet, they'll go lame
—a gristle starts growin' around the joints right above his hoof, and you
can't cure it. But you can take novacaine and give it to the horse [to deaden
the pain] and lead him around or show him, and he won't be lame. But as
soon as that novacaine dies, it goes to hurtin' again.
Now you know a person who knows can tell a horse's age by his teeth up
till he's eight or ten years old. You could take a regular little drill and drill
the cavities back in their teeth, and paint those cavities with permanganate
potash, and you could trade a mule fifteen years old for a seven- or eight-
year-old. Just raise that lip and look, see those cups in the teeth, you don't
have to tell him nothing. Just let him be his own judge.
To change their color, people used permanganate potash. This farmer
was a leather salesman, and owned a five-to-six-hundred-arre farm, and he
had an awful pretty spotted horse, and I wanted this horse. Well, I had a
mule that was fat and pretty, but she was gray-headed, her whole head up
here was white. Well, I took permanganated potash, a little salt, and a little
hot coffee poured over that. Then take you a corncob and go over that hair.
The more you put, the better it looks. I traded this muie for the man's spot-
ted horse. It must have been two or three weeks or a month later, and he
said, "You know, I like that mule fine, but I'll tell you what, you kept her
in the pen with another bunch of mules, and that mule just stood and

pawed she's so homesick, and you know, she's turned gray-headed?!" Now
that just tickled me to death, 'cause I dyed her hair.
I had an Appaloosa horse, and he just had a few spots about on him. I
said to a friend who was a barber, "Tony, get me some hair dye."
He said, "I'm gonna app this horse. He ain't got enough dots on him
where the Lord blessed him when He put His hands on him. I want more
spots to come on there."
Well, now, I'm not braggin', but I made the prettiest dots on him. I took
me a Irish potato, stuck it down in that dye, now I had the prettiest round
dot there, there's never been a artist that could beat me at dots. He traded
that horse to an old boy over at Hayesville, North Carolina and after the
dots faded out, he said, "I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll give a hundred and
fifty dollars to find that man that dotted this horse. I want to get him to
dot him again."
You get a lot of spoiled horses. I don't care how good a horse judge you
are, how long you've been tradin'. Why I bought a horse at Toccoa for my
grandson. He was a nice quarterhorse, pretty, fat, but he was a rig, what
you call a rig. When they altered him, they didn't get but one seed, and the
other one was up in his belly, but to look at him, you couldn't tell it. Then
we turned him in the pasture and he killed a Shetland pony, and broke two
or three calves' legs and he went to buckin'. Bucked off one of my grand-
sons, and got the other one afraid to ride him. All that happens. You'll get a
horse that'll just go loco overnight, but that goes with it. When you're
a'tradin' you get all that. A horse trader gets more than anybody, because
when somethin' happens to one, they hunt a trader to put it on, but he can't
eat it. He's got to get shed of it.
I've bought horses for two dollars and a half, and I've sold horses for as
high as fifteen hundred dollars apiece. It's been a long experience. I've
traded horses from Atlanta to Asheville. I used to follow the courts just like
a judge in the circuit. I'd meet more people. Before I bought a truck and
started truckin'em, I'd ride and lead a bunch. Oh, listen, I've been robbed.
I have come in a'carryin' my saddle—I've swapped out. I've been tellin' you
the good trades. I have come to the bridle—your judgment will fool you;
you never learn it all. I don't care how long you trade, you're gonna get
cheated. And if anyone's got somethin' that's wrong with whatever animal
they've got, they'll hunt a horse trader to put it on. A poor old horse trader
has the hardest time of anybody in this world. There's nobody believes him.
Ever'body says, "Oh, he's the biggest liar in the world." You just watch a
man when he comes a'wantin' t'trade. Whatever was wrong with his, if he
had a mooneyed horse, or a windy horse, or a lame horse, he'd go look at
that place first on a horse he. was tradin' for. But my wife and I have raised

four children, we own our own home. We ain't rich, but we got a very com-
fortable livin' for our age. But it's been rough for both of us.
Now I believe in feedin* whatever you have. A dog, a horse, whatever.
I've made more money by buying poor. I never made no money in my life
buying a fat horse; buy poor, feed him fat, then you can ask something for
him and get it. And ever body wants a pretty fat horse, but nobody wants a
poor horse. Trading horses is a sight in this world. Now there's lots of ex-
pense to go along with it. You hear the pretty part of these traders and you
say, "Well, that man's made a barrel of money." Well, it costs you
somethin' to tend to a horse, and feed him and take care of him like he
should be. It takes money. I've never fed a horse yet that I begrudged one
bite that he eat. I love to see'em eat. I enjoy feedin' him.
It's a long old life—a horse trader—if he stays with it a lifetime he'll
learn a whole lot of things that he may never even have thought about. Lit-
tle things that you wouldn't dream of. You can't ever give up. You've got to
fight a losin' battle. If you know you're gonna lose, you have to just keep
pushin'. That's why a horse trader can get by. Determination. You've got to
have the determination of an elephant to go through with it. I wouldn't take
nothin' in the world for the experience I got tradin' horses.
"I'd trade for anything I could get ahold of."
ADAM FOSTER
I guess I was just born to like to trade. I commenced tradin' when I was
a lad. First trade I ever made I swapped a sheep for a brood sow. I'd trade
for anything I could get ahold of. I've swapped for chickens, banjos, pistols,
anything.
I never did too much about changin' the looks of a horse, except dye their
hair. If they were gray, I'd dye their hair around their face with perman-
ganate potash. Mix it up in warm coffee; that made it color better. And
used to, back yonder when I was a young man, I'd raise the depressions
above their eyes. I'd pump that up and make'em look younger. I wouldn't
do that now. Cut a little hole in there, fill it with air, and then fill that hole
up. It'd stay maybe a week, long enough t'trade it.
They's a lot of people back in the olden days who'd work on their teeth,
but I never did do that. They'd file'em off. It didn't help the horses any. A
man older than me back yonder used to do it—he'd have a big old thing
put in his mouth to hold it open, so the horse couldn't shut his mouth, and
he'd take a file and cut them teeth smooth and flat. Sometimes they'd
cut'em too short and the horse couldn't eat nothin'.
Sometimes I'd have'em t'have a swiimcy in the shoulder. They'd be hop-

pin'. I'd take a piece of poke root, trim it down about like my little finger,
and cut a hole in that shoulder just in the skin, not cut it in the muscle,
push that poke root in there and that'd cure that swinney. The poison in
that poke root did it. Swinney is a strain, and then they'll go to hoppin',
and unless you do something for it, you've got a ruined horse.
I'd trim their feet and put turpentine in the frog of their hoof. The tur-
pentine would take care of their foot, take the soreness out if they got a nail
in it or got the thrush. Clean out that foot and fill it full of turpentine. I'd
also burn that turpentine, set it afire and let it burn; bake that foot hard in
there. That took the soreness out and hardened the frog of the foot. It
didn't hurt the horse. I set one afire one day and I had let the turpentine
run up his leg and the hair on his leg got afire, but I smothered it out with
a sack before it burned his skin.
I used to do my own doctorin'. I never did do anything to'em to
make'em look sound when they were lame. Fas tryin' t'cure'em.
Some traders would give'em shots, feed'em dynamite, make these old
dead horses spiriten up. Take a piece of a stick of dynamite and mash it up
in their feed. They say it'll spiriten'em up. I've tried it, but I didn't think it
done much good. That's been years ago.
1 was about seventeen years old when I done my first bit of horse trading.
The first one I ever owned myself was a mule colt. I rode an older mule to
North Carolina and got that colt. I paid seventy-five dollars for it. It was
rainy, the creek was way up, and I had to cross a big creek to get home. I

============================================================
PAGE 245

248

was afraid I couldn"t get that colt through the creek. There was an old foot
bridge two logs wide and floored, and I got a couple boys to help me push
that colt across that footlog. I turned the other mule loose and he swam
across the creek. I got him across all right and got him home safely. My fa-
ther hadn't wanted me to get that colt, but I said, "I'll never learn no
younger; I'm gonna go myself." When I got home, my daddy looked the
mule over, and said, "Well, son, you've got a good mule."
I thought it was. So in a few days, he said, "Well, now that you've got
one, just go buy you another one to match it. Have you a team." He said,
"Just go borrow the money; I'll sign your note." I had my own money to
pay for the first one. So I went to my uncle and asked to borrow some
money to buy another mule colt.
He said, "Well, how much do you want?"
I said, "I don't know. I don't know what the mule's gonna cost exactly."
He said, "Well, here's a check. I'll sign it and you just fill it out when you
buy the mule. Then come on back and give me a note for it."
Well, I had me a pair of mules then, and I thought I was rich. I kept one
of those two or three years, and swapped one of em for thirty-five acres of
land, with one hundred and fifty dollars to boot. The other I kept till he
was seventeen years old; then sold it to my brother.
The first real swappin' I done was over a T-model roadster. Me an' my
brother had a good big truck to haul peaches on. I told him I was gonna
buy a little old roadster, put a bed on it, and I could haul twenty-five or
thirty bushels of peaches. I bought it and went down in Georgia and got
me a load of peaches, started back up through the country at night, and I'd
just have one blow-out after another. Well, I finally got back about day-
light, and sold those peaches that day. An old man met me down the road
here and said, "Would you swap that car for this pair of mules?"
He had a pair of mules to the buggy. I said, "Well, I'll swap with you for
fifty dollars. I don't much want to trade this little car." 'Course I wanted to
trade but I just told him that. I was sick of it.
He said, "Well, I'm just gonna trade with you. I'm gonna give you the
boot. You can bring the car out in the mornin' and get the mules."
So I took the car over toward his house . . . had to cross the mountain,
steep narrow roads, and I was climbin' up them hills and that old T-model
got hot and went dead on me. You couldn't crank one when it got hot.
They'd go dead and quit on you. I got up nearly to the top of that moun-
tain, didn't lack two hundred yards and it was pretty flat from then on. It
went dead on me. I was there a'crankin' and crankin', and it wouldn't start.
I jacked up a hind wheel. When they got hard to crank, that'd help, and I
was just a'turnin' and a'crankin'. And this old man come in behind me

============================================================
PAGE 246

driving his mules. I was just afraid he wouldn't want to trade with me with
it not cranking. He said, "What's the matter—you havin' trouble?"
And I said, "Yeah, it's got a little hot. If you hook those mules to it and
pull it off, it'd crank in a few steps."
"Why," he said, "my buggy outfit wouldn't pull that car. That singletree
on them's too little, don't you see that?"
I didn't know what he meant then, but as it turned out, the mules
wouldn't pull nothin' but the buggy. Put a little weight to'em, they
wouldn't pull, and he didn't want me to know that! I kept on till eventually
I got it cranked. I got over the top of the hill and made it fine from there
on in. He wanted me to stay till the next day and teach his son how to drive
the car, but I told him, "No, I had to get on home." So I got my mules and
started back, and got in way after dark. Next day I swapped'em for a little
saddle mare and got a hundred and fifty dollars to boot. I was makin'
money I thought. I just give ninety dollars for the old car.
I just kept on goin' from there on—not regular. I worked jobs lots of my
life. But back through the thirties when it was so hard, I made enough
tradin' to support my family when everyone else was gettin' on the WPA.
I'd trade a horse, and if I got five dollars to boot, that'd do me a month.
The money from horse trading helps, but I always made my crops—'taters,
corn, beans—and had my hogs and killed five, six, eight hogs every year.
I've done ever'thing but steal to make a living. You don't get rich when
you're a trader. Sometimes you make some money and sometimes you lose
some money.
I used to go from place to place—Franklin, North Carolina, Murphy,
North Carolina, Clayton, Georgia, and I'd go to court to swap. And there'd
be these horse-swappin' conventions over in Union County and around, and
have a week's horse tradin'. It wasn't a fair, just a horse tradin', people get-
tin' drunk. They'd be in a different place every year. There'd be a few
farmers go, but mostly it was us horse traders, swappin' with one another.
Maybe you'd make a little money.
A fellow come by one day, and he wanted me to take a mule to Blairsville
for him for ten dollars. I said, "All right, I'll take him." He had it traded
off, but we stopped down here at Hiawassee, and I saw a man lookin' at the
mule in my truck. He said, "I've got a four-year-old mule I'll swap you for
that mule." The man who owned the horse told me to go ahead and trade.
He said, "You just go ahead and trade the way you want to. You know
more about tradin' than I do. If you can make me a good trade, go ahead."
We went on down the road and the man give me a big fat hog, fifteen to
twenty bushels of soybeans to boot and the old man with me just set still.
He never let on it was his mule. Well, we got the little four-year-old mule

============================================================
PAGE 247
============================================================

250 
FOXFIRE 4
we traded for, and it was wild, but we got it loaded on the truck. The man
with me said, "Well, now that you've traded, what do you want to do?"
I said, "Well, if you want to, we'll go down there and swap with the man
you planned to trade with." We went over to that fellow's house, and he
said, "Yeah, I'll swap with you. " I asked him twenty dollars to boot. He
said. "All right, if it'll work. I'll just put it to the wagon." We hooked it to
the wagon, and it was hitched up with his old gentle mule, and it worked
all right. He swapped with us. I got us back home, and I got that old man
about a hundred and fifty dollars and the same mule he had wanted to
trade for. Now that's horse trading.
I started out one day with my brother over here to Young Harris to
change horses for him. He wasn't no horse trader. Now he traded cattle,
but he couldn't trade no horses. I told him after we finished the trade and
got the horse loaded up, "You've got beat."
He said, "How do you know?"
I said, "I've owned that old mare. I know what she'll do. Let's go on
over here to Blairsville and swap horses again."
We swapped over there for a good little old mule, got some boot, went on
down to Murphy, swapped again, got boot again, and we come on back
home, and my brother give me twenty-five, thirty dollars for that day's
work. It was worth it to him. He made more that day than he expected to.
In the wind-up, I give him what boot I got, and he give me the last mule I
traded for. And I took it to Franklin, and swapped it for a big old mule, the
prettiest mule ever I seen, from old man Doc Angel's father. He was a big
fine-lookin' mule, but he was wind-broken. Couldn't get its breath when it
started t'work. He said, "Oh, that's a good mule as ever you've seen."
I said, "Ain't that mule's wind a little short?"
"Oh, no," he said, "there ain't nothin' wrong with that mule."
I knew his wind was broke and that's why I wanted t'get it. Trade on it.
So I swapped with him for fifteen dollars. He paid me, and just as quick as
he paid me—he wouldn't wait till I loaded the wind-broke mule—he
knowed it wouldn't load on a truck; it wouldn't ride on a truck. But I
finally did get it on the truck, and I seen it was gonna tear the side out of
the truck. It was about dark, and I went to town and got some big ropes to
tie him in there with; then I just got through Franklin, coming out toward
Hayesville, and that old big mule tore out of the side of the truck, and right
into the road he went. I had a fellow with me, and I asked him to lead the
mule to a friend's house, Ferd Burrcll, and figured we'd leave him there. So
I drove on slowly out to where the old man lived, and we put the mule in
the stable, and I patched up the truck a little and come on home. Next
mornin' I saw the sheriff—he was a horse trader, too, and I said, "Let's go
over to Franklin. I've got a mule over there I have to go and get." We went

============================================================
PAGE 248
============================================================

HORSE TRADING 
251
over there in his truck; he swapped a time or two with this fellow, Burrell,
and we finally brought the mule on back. He said, "Let's go to Blairsville
and trade some this evening." So we went on over there, and an old fellow
looked at that big fine sorrel mule up there on the truck, and he said, "I've
got a good mare mule down at the house I'll swap you for that mule."
I said, "I don't guess you'd want to pay me the boot I'd ask you."
He said, "Just go down and look." So we went on down to his house,
and he said, "I'll tell you what, I'll give you fifteen dollars, every dollar I've
got." My mule wouldn't compare to his, and I knew it. I said, "Just let me
have it, and here's your mule." Put his'n on the truck and I was gone. Went
on back home, swapped it the next day for another'n, got fifty dollars to
boot. Sometimes you make a pretty good little trade. But I've gone three
months at a time with only three dollars.

MAKING TAR
W
hen wagon axles and wheel
hubs were made completely
of wood, resin (or "tar")
melted out of fat pine was smeared on the axle ends to minimize the fric-
tion of the turning wheel hub. In addition, the tar found other farm uses:
when cattle were dehorned, it was smeared on the stubs of the horns to
keep flies away; when livestock got scraped or cut, it was smeared on the
wound, and when they got sore feet, their hooves were poured full of it
and bound up with rags; and when sheep got "head rot," a little tar was
forced down into their tear ducts to open their heads up. Even humans
used it. For coughs, a syrup made of one part tar, five parts molasses, and
two parts sulfur, taken one teaspoonful at a time, supposedly helped. Tar
was also put on blisters, sores, and sometimes even poison ivy.
One day a neighbor walked into our office and asked us if we had ever
seen tar made. He had just heard of a rock on Wolffork where the commu-
nity used to gather to do it, but it had gotten turned over on its side over the
years. We tracked it down, turned it back upright, and with the help of
Mack and Terry Dickerson, put it back into action.
When I first walked out to the tar rock with the rest of the crew that had
helped turn it upright, Mack and Terry were getting ready to make it. I
felt excited. I was getting an opportunity to witness and learn about some-
thing few teen-agers my age ever get a chance to see. I felt proud that I was
a part of it, and I was determined to make something out of this rare ex-
perience. I knew it was something special when some of the neighbors came
out to watch it. I wondered how many other kids my age had had this
chance to see how tar was made long ago. Perhaps they had read about it in
books, but really getting to see it? There was something inside of me that
told me to never forget so that someday I could tell my kids how it was done,
and then they could tell their kids and so on. At least somebody would still
know how to do it.

When I was out there watching and helping them make it, it just made
me more interested in how people did do things like this long ago when
there weren't any machines or devices to do it for them.

PLATE 250 
As a child, Terry Dickerson used to watch his father melt resin ("tar")
out of fat pine on this rock. With Terry and Mack Dickerson's help, we re-created
that experience, and many of the neighbors came to watch.
When I set out with the rest of the crew, I had a feeling of determi-
nation. We were going to turn that rock over. No question about it. We also
had the feeling that this was just some big hunk of rock that was in some-
one's way all the time. We had no idea that it was a special rock for making
something useful. We hadn't been told in advance what the rock had once
been used for. When we got to the rock, I wondered about that depression
in it. Finally I realized that the rock was once used for making tar. Then I
became interested in it.
A couple of days later, Terry and Mack started to make it. All of us came
to watch. There was interviewing, and a lot of pictures were taken. The
making of the tar was very interesting. Even some of the community folks
came to watch. It was kind of like a friendly reunion. Some of the people
said that it reminded them of the past when old-timers used to make tar.
Well, though some of the people thought that the old way of making tar
had died out, through the aid of Foxfire, Mack and Terry, and us, once
again the old-timers' way of making tar was relived.

PLATE 251 
To turn the rock over we
dug the earth out from behind it and
rolled it back using poles as levers.
PLATE 
252 
Mack 
and Terry first
packed the iron pot full with slivers of
fat pine (pine that is almost solid
resin).
PLATE 253 
Terry hammered the last
pieces into the pot with a stake to make
sure it was packed as full as it could be.
PLATE 
254 
When 
the 
pot 
was
packed, it was inverted over the depres-
sion in the rock's surface, and over the
tiny groove cut in the rock to allow the
basin to drain. Then a piece of tin was
placed between the pot's rim and the
groove in the rock.
PLATE 255 
Next, Mack and a neigh-
bor brought water from a nearby stream
to make up a batch of red-clay mud.

============================================================

============================================================

PLATE 256 
The water was poured
onto the clay, then stirred to make a
good stiff mixture.
PLATE 
257 
The 
clay 
was 
then
packed around the rim of the pot to
keep the flames from the fire that will
be built over the pot from lapping in
under the rim and setting the wood in-
side on fire. The piece of tin keeps the
mud from filling the groove in the rock
and blocking the flow of resin.
PLATE 258 
Next Mack and Terry
piled wood over the pot and started a
bonfire. They kept adding wood to
make the fire as hot as possible.

============================================================

PLATE 25V 
Then they waited for the
tar to begin to flow.
PLATE 260 
Finally the resin began to
melt and run down the insides of the
black pot where it collected in the rock
basin and drained out the groove and
down the side of the rock into a pan
Terry had waiting.
PLATE 261 
When the pan was filled, the resin was poured into a container for fu-
ture use. It keeps indefinitely, remaining in a syrupy form. The flow finally stopped
after we had filled three pans. We took ane pan with us and Mack and Terry kept the
rest.

w
e first became interested in
logging when Bill Lamb,
one of our earliest and finest
contacts, told us the haunting memory that follows. We saved it specifically
to work into this chapter:
"They'd take them old log carts—I don't know to this day why they
wouldn't trail up logs—but they'd hook the oxen to them carts and then
they'd just have to scatter around to stay out of the way of that log pushing
that cart down the mountain. In the place of stringing up four or five logs
like people got to doing finally in this country, why, they'd just have to out-
run one log.
"I've seen poor old steers—and them with big yokes on—I've seen them
have to run just as hard as they could run to stay out of the way of a log,
and the log just running them over. If it run out [of the logging road] and
hit something, it was just about one's neck broke, or his leg, or something
'r'nother that way. Sometimes they'd try to jay loose from one where it was
on too bad a run. And if you hit a rock solid sometimes, just stall them just
as dead as they could be until you pulled and twisted off.
"I'll tell you what I've seen. I've seen as high as five or six yoke of cattle
to one log when they was in here logging out the old virgin timber. I've seen
five or six yoke go through all the punishment that ever you see'd on any-
thing. 'Course the ground wasn't level, you know. Just to get out it was over
a hump or in a holler. And I've seen steers picked plumb off of the ground
by the head going through a low place in here, and then I've seen them
going over the top with the old wheel cattle in back next to the log—maybe
them pulling over there—and them just having to slide their head right
sideways in the ground to keep from catching their nose in the ground.
"And every once in a while an old steer'd get a foot cut off—catch it be-
tween a log and a rock or something, you know—and maybe just cut their
foot just about off. Have them to kill.

============================================================

"Why, it was a sight the punishment that was put on the old cattle. They
was always short-legged nearly, you know, and couldn't get around good.
People always used a whip as long as from here to that seat over yonder,
and a man could make the hair fly off a steer with that. Them old whips
a'popping—they'd go like rifles sometimes.
"And sometimes five or six yoke, and them all strung out. Well, if the
road wasn't straight, they'd go around a tree here and below a tree yonder
—like people would do building a road through the woods. They'd dig all
the roads and put in a fender log, and they'd come down through there and
get at a tree, and them old cattle that was back next to the log—it
was a sight to see how they'd goose them old cattle there with them whip
stocks, you know, to make them wheel over to keep that log from binding
against the tree here; and them other ones out yonder had lots of that load
out yonder past that, you see. Well, they had to hold them cattle and their
load, too. Well, that'd make the awfullest strain on them cattle ever you
see'd. If it'd jerk them over and throw them over the fender log, then it was
back up everything till you got them back up.
"Lord, the punishment they had. If there was ever a blessing that come
on anything, it was when they got the trucks and bulldozers to log with to
take all of that burden off of the old horses and oxen. Why, they'd have a
great big barn full of cattle; maybe have ten or twelve head of cattle. They
was some people that didn't have no mercy on themselves nor the cattle nei-
ther. That's what made it so bad. A poor old steer doing everything it
could, and then a man just reach over and lift him off of the ground. Why,
I've heered them whips pop as big as a thirty-eight pistol. Just, 'Ka-bow!
Ka-bow!' and if you was where you could see, lots of times the blood was
trickling out of them steers where they was hit. They'd take a plait on a
cracker as long as my arm out of thread, and they'd beeswax that thread
and they'd plait it on the end of that whip, you see. And then they'd have a
big long whip stock on them.
"Why, they could just stand here and whip one yonder at the edge of the
porch and just make him bounce."
Millard Buchanan, who spent much of his life logging, became our pri-
mary contact for this article largely because he has been involved with log-
ging from the time it was done with animals up through the advent of
trucks and modern machinery.
Millard's ancestors settled in the Smokies through a land grant from the
Queen of England. They've been in the mountains ever since. Millard him-
self was raised right above Waynesville, North Carolina, on Browning
Branch. He lived there for thirty-five years right up through the Depres-
sion: "That was back in the days when everything was down so low. Jim

Crawford started building a house, and back then, you know, everything
was done with a hand saw, and when the hand saw would get a little rusty
or something, people would carry a meat skin with them and rub that blade
every time it started to bind. They'd have to rub it two or three times saw-
ing one piece. Old man Jim, he worked and he got the subfloor and every-
thing down on the house and started to put up the walls, and then quit.
"And some of them two or three days after that told that old man Jim
was down there about drunk, and what a time for him to pitch a drunk and
quit. Said to him, says, 'Jim, how come you quit carpentering?' Says, 'We
thought that house was going to be put up and maybe be a little con-
struction work around here.'
"And he said, 'Well, I was doing all right,' he said, 'if it wadn't for one
of them damn old poor dogs that eased up and stole my meat skins,' he
said, 'That shut the job down!' "
Millard's contact with horses and steers has been constant throughout his
life. His grandfather, for example, was a cattle buyer. When he got ready to
make a drive, he'd send letters ahead to the men who raised them to let
them know what day he'd be coming through so they could have them
gathered up and ready for him. Then he'd head out picking up several head
at each farm, driving them along the road with him as he went, and camp-
ing at night. By the time he got near the end of his route, he might have as
many as a hundred and fifty head. These he'd drive to Clyde, North Caro-
lina, where they'd be sold, loaded on railroad cars, and shipped to Chicago.
Of course there were animals around their farm, too:
"I never did try to lay off and plant with a steer. They were too slow for
that. But steers and a wagon might go to town just the same as horses and a
wagon back then.
"We did our plowing with horses. And then we'd break up new ground
—-pull the roots out with horses or cattle, or work around them till they rot-
ted loose. I've plowed many a new ground, and if you didn't watch it and
the horse get going a little too fast and that plow hit a root or a stump and
the plow handles catch you right under the ribs there—I've had my sides
blue all over plumb up under my arms and back under my shoulders where
them confounded plows have kicked me. Shey'd shore get you, and I'll
guarantee you couldn't dodge one neither! It'd shore fly up and get you.
Raise you plumb up off the ground sometimes it'd kick so hard.
"We used to have an old mare we called Dinah. And old Dinah, I'd put
her in new ground and go to plowing her and every time that plow would
nit a root or a rock or something and hang a little bit, she'd look back at
you and snap her teeth. She'd pop her teeth just as fast as she could
Pop'em, and go to switching her tail. She'd get mad whenever that there
harness jerked her two or three times. That was the aggravatingest thing's

ever been in the world. I throwed rocks at her many an hour for running
sideways and snapping her teeth at me! And she'd bite you too if you was
in reach of her. She wouldn't just pop them teeth. She'd bite, too!
"And then, of course, I did a lot of logging with horses and steers. People
have stopped raising them. Young people don't take an interest in nothing
like that no more. Young people now, why they've got something else to do.
If they work any at all, they get out here and work on a car or motorcycle
or something like that.
"See, back then they wasn't nothing for us to do—only things like that.
Wasn't no picture show. Nothing to do without you just went over and sat
and talked to your neighbor a while. Wasn't no radios. Wasn't no TVs.
Wasn't such a thing as lights. If you wanted a light, you carried an old
lantern. [By the] time you'd carried it an hour, the globe would be
smoked on it till you just as well catch a lightning bug for you couldn't see a
damn thing with it. Go in the house and think you rould read, and in thirty
or forty minutes' time have to get up and clean the globe where it was
smoked. And that was it, see? So they wasn't nothing to do much back then
only just fiddle around with something like steers, you know, when you
wasn't working.
"And then cattle was cheap. Beef cattle and milk cattle was cheap. The
best would sell for fifteen or twenty dollars apiece. That's all they'd bring.
Well, if you had a yoke of steers that was broke and matched up, well you
could sell them for a hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars. You see the
difference in price. Good yoke of steers would bring as much as a pretty
good herd of cattle would otherwise."
The following section begins with Millard's method of breaking and
training steers, and progresses through his logging days. We hope you en-
joy it.

BREAKING AND TRAINING OXEN
I like to work with steers [better than horses or mules]. They're slow-na-
tured, the most of them is. I just like to fool with'em. After they've got used
to you and you get'em broke, they've got a whole lot more sense than a horse
or a mule. And they won't come half as near hurting you. You can work a
horse or a blame mule and you think they's not a bit of harm in him in the
world—maybe keep him ten years and go in to get him one morning and the
son-of-a-gun'll kill you. Wheel and kick you or something. I always liked to

work a steer more than anything I ever fooled with. They're just easier na-
tured.
And they're not near as expensive on feed. And then another advantage:
back when we was working cattle, we always fed'em high, you know—cot-
tonseed meal and hull—and kept'em good and fat. And if one got a leg
broke or something like that, we could skin him out and eat him and we
wasn't losing a thing. If he got hurt and had to be killed, why he went
across the table!
Getting started, it takes a pretty good judge of cattle. You've got to know
pretty well what kind of cattle you've got. A red Devon is actually the best
stock of work steer they is. That's an old stock of cattle—about as old a
stock as they was. They're a deep red, and they was all horned cattle. You
dehorned all of'em. Them son-of-a-guns, they just know what work means.
Seems like whenever you first put'em in a yoke, if you start off with'em
right, they know what you're doing with'em.
But that Devon was a deep red color, and that's another thing made peo-
ple like them more than anything else. The color made that much
difference on account of showing up so good. And then they was a type
stock that they wasn't too much difference in'em. What I mean, you know,
you wouldn't find a big bone and a little bone. Their bones was all about
the same size, and their heads was all made alike. In other words, they're
just matched, you know.
Now we worked Jerseys; we worked Holsteins; we worked other types,
but actually the best type was the Devon. We worked good Jerseys and
Guernseys, but for a good tough work animal, the Devon had him beat. As
a usual thing, a Jersey is easier broke than a Devon is, but they're mean.
You might work one all day, or maybe work it a week and think they
wasn't nothing wrong with it at all, and whenever you drop the bow [on
the yoke] and turn him loose, the son-of-a-gun wheel and hook you or kick
you. They're just natured that way. They're mean. You've got to handle
them a whole lot rougher than you do a Devon. They's mischief in a Jersey.
Jersey bulls is something that's bad to fight. Jersey's worse than a Guernsey.
And hybrid stock just don't make a good work steer. They've bred'em up
to where they ain't got no sense. You take anything that's hybrid and some-
how or another it affects their brain. You can take these black cattle—these
black Angus—and you can handle them any way you want to; and then
you stay away from'em a week and go back into the barn to get'em and
they'll climb the walls. Put you out!
Now if they don't have horns, that's muley cattle. Muley don't have
horns. They're born without any. Back years ago, they all had horns, and
see, they kept improving them and got'em to where they bred'em without
horns. You wouldn't see one in a hundred that didn't have horns back forty

years ago. And if you had one didn't have horns, he was a muley. That was
the name for him. He was a muley cow or a muley steer. It was just a rare
thing. People was really glad to get ahold of one. That's the way they started
breeding them and getting the horns off of them. They'd get them natural
muleys—and they was long and far between—but they'd keep them natural
muley heifers and then whenever they had a muley bull, they'd mate'em up.
See, they wanted'em with no horns. That's what they was trying to do—
get'em bred with no horns. And they've got it now. You don't see many
with horns. The horns is about done away with. But they wasn't making
much success on that breeding the horns off till along about '40.
[If you had young, horned cattle and you were going to leave the horns
on rather than dehorning them] you could make them grow in any shape
you wanted to. If you put rubber bands on them and a stick to separate
them, and let it stay for a day or so and then take it off for two or three
days and then put it back, you can shape them. You can make them grow
any shape if you'll fix it to where there's the least little steady pull [on the
horns]. Makes them look better. We used to take'em and when their horns
got to be about a foot long, we'd put a small piece of brass on the ends, like
a forty-five pistol hull. Put brass nubs on the ends, and they'd just shine in
the sun.
And if their horns is right—if you've got'em turned like the regular old
work steer—you can hear'em a'going along the road, and them old horns
will just be cracking together as they walk—just making a tune nearly.
If you want to pick out a yoke, you make sure the cow's legs are the same
length, and the backs are the same height. You have to have two cows
about the same build—legs and all—cause if you don't, you'll have one
long lanky steer and one short one. Also you have to pick them out by the
shape of their heads.
The best age to start getting them halter wise where you can tie'em and
handle'em is when they're just sucking calves just being weaned—when
they're about three months old. Just take'em when they're calves and start
handling'em—play with them two or three times a week, or maybe once a
week on Saturday evenings or Sundays. Have to fool with'em a month or
more to gentle'em down and get them used to you.
And then you want to pen'em together. If you're going to work'em to-
gether, you ought to pen'em together and feed'em together, and make sure
one can't crowd the other out when they're eating. Keep'em together all the
time, and then whenever you turn'em loose out here, they never will sepa-
rate. They'll stay together, and wherever you find one, you'll find the other.
That way you wouldn't have no trouble going and getting your steers when
you got ready to work'em 'cause they'd be together.

These steers I've got up here, I can go up there and tie one of thern and
start off from there with it, and that other one would tear out and follow
me if I was to lead him plumb over into North Carolina. They've been
done that way all the time, see?
But get them used to a halter first. Get them to where you can lead them
around anywhere you want to go. Get them to where you can hande them
in any direction you pull on them with that halter and them not pull back.
If you have trouble, get two men—get one in front and one in back. Then
if the one in front pulls and the steer fails to come, let that'n behind have
him a good long withe and move'im!
And then when you want him to stop, say, "Whoa," and then hold him
after you say, "Whoa," and make him stop, see? You need to be pretty stout
yourself or they'll overpower you and do whatever they want to do. I've took
steers when they was nearly too big to train right and put bits in their
mouth just like working a horse 'cause I couldn't handle'em no other way.

And I have run a rope around through under their jaw. Just any way to
hold'em to start with.
After I get my steers broke, I won't have no rope on'em. I might leave a
halter on'em on account of them looking better, but I won't have no ropes
on'em. If I tell one to come here and he don't come, or I tell him to back
and he don't back, I'll reach up and grab that whip. I use that whip to
drive with. And you don't have to use it hard.
Ropes are just in the way. After you fool with'em a little bit—get'em to
where they know what's going on—you can just take that whip and throw
it up and let it fall easy and that cracker'll wind around that horn and it'll
stay there. You can pull it. If you jerk it right hard, it'll be just like it's tied.
You can pull your steer anywhere then.
See, in other words, you've got to show them that you're a better man
than they are. And until you do, you can't do nothing with'em. You want to
get'em gentle to where you can handle'em, you know, but then if they won't
do what you want'em to do, you've got to foul them in a shape to show
them that they have to. And if you one time get'em showed that you're
boss, that's the end of the trouble you'll have with'em. Unless one of em was
to kick you or something. Now every once in a while, any of'em will take a
spell maybe. They'll kick just like a mule. And they're a something that you
never know when they're going to kick nor nothing else. You'll never be ex-
pecting nothing, and one of them things'll kick you quick as lightning can
strike. And when he kicks, he kicks hard too. I'll guarantee you he'll bring
the hide! Lot of times they'll come up forwards. You'll be a'walking down
by the side of one, walking up towards his head, and he'll kick forwards
same as he will backwards. Mule or horse'll just kick back, but a steer'll kick
sideways, forwards, or back! If they take a notion to hit you, they'll just
about hit you. They's no way you can get away from'em. That's exactly the
situation!
Now after you've got them gentled, you ran put both oxen together in a
yoke. Start'em off as a team and, see, they'll more or less gait together. See,
that's one thing on the length of their legs and stuff that you want to watch.
If you have a short-legged one and a long-legged one, then as long as they
work together that there long-legged one'll be just a little bit faster than the
other one because he'll take longer steps. That's the reason you've got to size
'em up that way.
And if you let them turn in the yoke a few times, they won't never do
nothing only turn the yoke every time you go to work them. If you'll pick
you up a club, and get one person on one side and one on the other and go
to laying it on their sides from their hind ends plumb to their heads, about
four or five licks is all you'll hit'em till they'll turn that yoke back and be
a'standing like they're supposed to be. You've got to knock that into'em.

They're kind of natured like a horse. You don't find as many balky steers
as horses, though. They work kind of like a horse. They's some of'em that
are higher nerved—kind of nervy—sort of scary. You can take some of'em
that is high-nerved like that and they're scary as long as they live. Just like
a horse is. I mean it's in them just like it is humans. You know you can get
people—they get excited awful easy and it takes'em a while to get over it-
Well, you hit that in cattle or horses or anything you work with. You get
ahold of one of them high-nerved ones and you've got to work him awful
easy. You've got to just about pet him into [working]. You might have to
knock him down every once in a while, but when you do that, then, and get
him stopped, then you've got to pet him. You've got to work him easy.
And then you get some that's just plumb old down stubborn, and when
you get them there stubborn ones, you've got to pick you up something till
you show'em who's boss, and knock'em where you want them.
When my steers goes to cutting up, I take that whip right over there and
give'em a cut or two and that straightens'em out. They know what that is!
They know what it means.
They'll get used to that yoke pretty fast. If they don't, I'd take'em out
there and tie'em to a tree out there in a field somewhere where all they
could do would be go around and around it. I'd put that yoke on them of a
morning, and I'd take it ofT'em when I fed'em that night. Do that about a
week. Let'em wear that yoke all day long and not take it off. Let them get
theirselves tangled up any way they want to. They'll come untangled.
They'll not break their necks nor nothing. They'll get tangled up and they'll
get untangled, and they'll find that it's a whole lot easier for'em to stand
and not tangle'emselves up and they'll do it. And that's the way I'd do that
now. Tie them to where they can go around and around but not get the
lines or nothing under their feet. Just tie one of'em to the tree and let him
control the other one. And then you might not have no more trouble. They
might go to work.
So let'em wear the yoke till they get used to it, and then start pulling a
little something. First thing to do is to get'em used to the rattle of that chain
cause, see, they have to pull with a chain. Put that yoke on and let'em get
used to the rattle of that ring in the yoke, you know. And then the yoke it-
self'll rattle. It makes a funny racket. Get them used to that, and then put a
heavy log chain in that ring then, and let it pull between'em—let them drag
it around till they get used to that racket. And then after four or five times
dragging, put'em to a sled—something light. Let'em have that thing light
four or five times, or half a dozen times for an hour or an hour and a half
maybe every other day, and then go to putting weight on it. Let'em pull
that [empty] sled around about a half a dozen times, and then the next time
you hook it up, get on it.

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
Mine wanted to wring and twist a little bit when I put them to the sled,
and I just got that whip and give'em two or three cuts and that was it.
Then start laying the loads to'em—not too heavy—till they see they can
move what you've got hooked to'em, and then just in a short time you can
just load any amount you want to. They won't quit pulling. They won't
back up from it if they find out they can't pull it. They'll still try to pull it
anyhow. But if you ever do overload one and let him quit, then you've got
to straighten him out again. It's better to just give'em what they can go on
with until they get used to the work altogether, and then you've got it, then.
Then you can do whatever you want to with'em.
If they try that turning in the yoke again, tie their tails together with a
rope—and tie it tight, too. And only give'em a little space in between where
you've got'em tied. See, then they can't twist their hind ends. If they can't
twist their hind ends around, they can't turn that yoke. See, they've got to
step out kindly away from it before they can turn it; and if you've got their
tails tied together, they can't get out there far enough to turn it. I've done
a little bit of everything to'em!
You need to work'em in a pretty good-sized lot; and when one goes to
getting ahead of the other one, hold that rope a little tighter on the faster
one and give that other one a cut and make him stay up. And if they want
to run, they'll not run far because they give out easy. And if they do want to
run and they run a little ways, why don't let'em stop whenever they want
to. Just keep'em a'going. And if one was to go ahead of the other'n, give the
one that's behind another cut. That's the way you've got to do'em.
And if you want one to go to the left, tell him, "Haw," and if you want
him to go the right, tell him, "Gee." Now the old way if you want one to
come to the left, you hollered, "Whoa, come here." And if you wanted him
to go to the right, you hollered, "Whoa, back," or, "Gee."
Your lead steer is the one on the left, but you can work'em from either
side after you get!em broke. They claim the one on the left always has a lit-
tle harder job than the other one. I never could figure that out. I never
could see no difference in it myself. Maybe I wasn't that much educated
on'em, but I've worked'em all my life—horses and mules and steers—and I
never could figure out where one had it any rougher than the other.
Now if we was working and something happened to one [of the steers], if
you've got one broke to where he knows what's going on and'll mind you,
you can take another one that's wild—don't make no difference how wild
he is—and put him in [in place of the one that got hurt] and the one you've
already got broke will help control that other one. He won't let him get
loose from you. He'll more or less help hold him in place.
And the way we used to work that: When we worked four or six steers
together and something happened to one of them and we had to put a new

============================================================

one in that didn't know nothing about the work, we'd put him back here at
the back with what we call the wheel cattle. You always had your [pair of]
leaders up front, and the chain that was hooked on that lead yoke was
hooked onto the back catties' yoke too. Well, see, he couldn't do nothing
only stay in line because the front ones would be pulling him till all he
could do was just twist sideways or lay down! He either had to go or lay
down. That was all. And if he laid down, why, it was so hot under his belly
he had to get up! He didn't stay there long.
That new steer might have just come in from pasture. Back then when so
many cattle was used, you caught them up out of the woods because it was
free cattle range. People didn't have too much pasture under fence for
nothing only just their milk stock. Whenever a steer got up about a year or
a year and a half old, why he was took to the mountains and he stayed
there till you was ready to sell [or use] him. Never did come in no more
only just heifers and cows, you know, that was ready to calf. Some of them
steers in the mountains would be four years old. Then time something hap-
pened to one you were working—get him crippled up or get a horn knocked
off, or sometimes they'd bruise their horns and take the "swell-head" we
called it and get pus in their horns and the side of their head would swell up
and you'd have to bore that and let the pus out and not make him work for
a month or two till he got straightened back out—we'd just go in the woods
and catch one up and cram him back at the wheel and he had to go. In
three or four days' time he was doing his part just like he'd been at it all the
time. But he was still wild. He'd be hard to handle, you know, till you'd
handled him two or three months.
Or you could put that new one in the middle yoke with one that had
been working a long time. He couldn't get loose nor nothing because he was
fouled behind and in front too. Them lead cattle in front would pull his
head off if he didn't pull.
I've fooled with steers a lot. I've dehorned a lot of them. Saw'em off with
a hand saw—dullest hand saw you could find. That made their horns heal
a whole lot quicker to use a dull saw that didn't booger up their horn none.
You go to sawing in that horn and the blood start to flying and them son-of-
a-bitches go to bellering and bawling and get down on their knees—you
could hear'em from here to Clayton. Had a gauge we could pull their head
through to hold'em. It was bound to hurt. I've sawed horns off of'em to
where blood would be running as far as from here to the barn out there—
great big long branch of it. Cut off maybe fifty or seventy-five at a time, you
now, and you had a lot of blood. Get so God-dang sick have to quit and
leave a while and then come back and start again. We dehorned all of'em
with a hand saw. Only way we knowed. Only way we'd ever been taught to
dehorn>em.

And we had to put shoes on'em. I don't guess any of you boys have ever
seen an ox shoe. We'd have two shoes for each foot —or two pieces for each
foot. It took two pieces, you know, to make a shoe. See, their hooves are
split in the middle; between their toes there wasn't nothing, and there's
nothing back there between their heels either. So the shoe was two separate
pieces of steel. You had to put [the steers] in a special stock when shoeing
them and tie their feet down to a big heavy post where they couldn't move
them—put big leather straps around their feet and tie them to that post and
shoe'em while they was tied 'cause they's never been one that wouldn't kick.
Aw, them things would lay down and bawl and beller and everything else
whenever you started putting shoes on'em. It didn't hurt'em. You just can't
hammer on their feet. Horse is a whole lot different. I guess they more or
less know-you're supposed to hammer on'em. Some of them, when you first
go to put shoes on'em they're pretty rough, but not nothing like a steer. You
just can't shoe a steer without having you a pole where you can pull his leg
out from under him and put it to that pole and put a leather strap around
it where it wouldn't hurt his leg; put the shoe on and then turn him loose
and pull another foot up.
LOGGING WITH STEERS AND HORSES
Logging with oxen—that's nasty. It's nasty when you're fooling logging
with them. The general field of logging is just hard work. Work from before
daylight till after dark. That's the general field. Having to wade in mud hip
deep half the time, and snow and ice the other half. That's like the kind of
winters we used to have at that time. We've not had no rough winters in a
long time. We ain't had no really rough winters since the early '40s.
We used oxen to drag the logs out of the woods with, and then we used
horses to carry them to the mill and from the mill to the railroad siding. We
used horses to wagons, and we used oxen to wagons. From the time the log
started out of the woods till it got to the railroad siding, it would take about
three weeks.
But you want to back up and start at the beginning? Okay.
First, your logs have to be cut to length. You allow two to four inches. If
you're cutting sixteen-foot stuff, you allow a little and that way it will all
square to sixteen feet. We used a crosscut saw to cut the tree down, and we
cut the limbs off with an axe. Mostly you just worked up to where the limbs
or knots set in and quit there. You didn't use no knotty lumber without you
was going to use it yourself, or somebody wanted to build a barn or some-
thing. You either kept that yourself or left it laying in the woods. We used
firewood, but we wouldn't go that far back in the woods after it. There was
too much of it close by. See, where a lot of these big cleared fields is now,

============================================================

PLATE 263

back then that was standing in heavy woodland—big trees. You wouldn't
cut down more than four or five of them big trees [out of a field close to
home] till you'd have enough wood to last all winter. You take trees that's
four and five foot through—one of them six-foot saws just barely reach
through it—and you don't have to cut too many of them to have winter
wood. Very few. So what we left back in the woods where we was logging
just laid there and rotted.
We done all the cutting with a crosscut saw. They wasn't such a thing as
a power saw back then. You could set your axe head in the lead when it was
sawed out, and the handle will point the way the tree will fall. I can drive
pegs out through there, and cut a tree and drive them pegs on into the
ground with that tree. They had contests like that back when they used to
use crosscut saws.
And whenever we cut them, we had to cut'em different to what they do
with these power saws, because if one [tree] was leant, you never could get
a crosscut saw under it far enough to keep it from busting. Oak in particu-
lar. If you didn't cut past the heart of it, if it was leant any at all it'd split
wide open when you laid the saw into the back of it. You couldn't saw it
fast enough to keep it from splintering. It'd go to pulling splinters out of the
middle there at the heart, and if it was fifty feet to the first limb, that's how

============================================================

far it would split! It'd ruin the whole tree. Ash was another thing that was
awful bad to split. On sugar maple and oak too, I've chopped six hours
chopping a lead the way the son-of-a-gun had to fall to keep it from splinter-
ing. Couldn't saw it, you know. Just had to set in with an axe and chop it.
And once in a while you'd hit one that you'd just have to chop down. You
take one so big that you could almost set that sofa there on the stump, and
you set in chopping that down and you've got a day's work ahead of you. A
hard one, too, I mean. It'd just take all day for one to fall and hit the
ground. That's all.
Now with these power saws, you don't have to saw past the heart since
it's so fast. It cuts faster than the tree will split.
Right after the war in '46, I cut some poplar and white pine and
yellow pine that was awful big. And we had awful big chestnuts and awful
big mountain oaks, and what they called hard maple—that was sugar ma-
ple—we had a sight of that that was awful big. I've worked as high as two
days getting one log to a sawmill with six head of cattle.
Now cattle: if he'll work good, one steer ought to pull his weight. To
load one and not load him out of reason to where he ought to go on, judge
what he'll weigh standing on foot and then load just about what his stand-
ing weight will be. Say the two of them weigh about two thousand pounds.
Well, about a ton gives them a load on the ground. If the load is up on a
wagon, why they can pull three times that much. But if it's on the ground
where it sticks, they ought to pull a ton if they weigh a thousand pounds
apiece as long as it's level or downhill a little bit. They ought to carry their
weight.
We had pulling contests up until World War II—mules in their class,
year-old fillies up to six-year-old—like that. They'd pull weights. You keep
adding on till they couldn't pull anymore. No money prize unless maybe
you got two dollars and a half for having the best in the county. But every-
body knowed you had the best! Or you'd get a ribbon—great big thing to
hang up on the wall. Blue was first, yellow second, and pink was third. If
you got that pink ribbon, that was something, you know. That was the
starting of breeding up stock—cattle and horses—because from '30 until
up about '33 was when they started bringing this registered stock in
here and breeding up the size of them. See, that old-type Devon, they'd
have to be seven or eight years old to get up around fourteen to sixteen hun-
dred pounds. It was something unusual for one to get up to eighteen or two
thousand pounds. He'd have to be ten or twelve year old. Well, you take the
same cattle the way they got it bred up with that registered stuff, and by the
time he's three years old, now, he'd weigh as much as he would whenever
he was eight back then. Same way with horses and mules.

All the big stock had to be shipped in from Missouri until we got our own
breeding going here. Now, then, they're breeding them back down to where
they'll be small again because people have no use for the big ones. No work
for them to do. And it doesn't cost so much to feed the smaller ones. We're
coming back now to what it was fifty years ago.
Back fifty years ago, if you did see a big horse, some of these companies
had him on a logging job.
I had a pair of bay horses. I reckon I kept them about three years and
logged with them. And them confounded son-of-a-guns would stand and lis-
ten at me drive them grabs, and they could tell just as well when I got done
driving the grabs as / could. And they was restless. They'd just stand and
paw the ground and look back at me. And they never would move as long
as them lines was laying on the ground. They'd stand there. When I went to
hook the spreads—I'd just reach and get the spreads and hook onto the logs
before I'd reach for the lines—and whenever I stooped over to get them
lines, they'd hit that thing with everything they had in'em; and if I hap-
pened to miss the lines, I wouldn't get'em stopped for a hundred yards
a'hollering at'em. But if I got ahold of the lines, we went to the yard, my
shirttail in the air!
Boy, I pulled big logs with them. I've had eighteen sixteen-foot long ones
behind them at one time. Load three trucks with one load coming off the
mountain. That was over yonder above Cherokee [North Carolina] on
Black Rock in that steep country in there. And that was virgin timber. We
cut timber in there. We cut a lot in there that the four-foot scale stick
wouldn't even reach across the end where you scaled it. We just cut all
kinds of hemlock and chestnut in there that was bigger than the scale stick
would scale. I pulled it with them little horses, too. I called them little
horses, but they was big.
I'd pull that header log out and chain it to a stump or another tree stand-
ing there when I was bumping others up against it to keep it from running
off. And then whenever I got them logs all trailed up together, I wouldn't
have to do nothing only just get the slack all pulled out of them. They'd go
to running, and I'd hook on that J-grab and unchain that header from that
stump—maybe not pull the [train of logs] no further than the road there,
and those logs would run [by themselves] as far as from here to Kate
Cathey's down yonder [about three-quarters of a mile]. By the time that
back log would pass me, it'd be making seventy-five miles an hour just
a'whistling through the air!
Regular teams most of the time was six cattle—three pairs for heavy
work and heavy logging. As a usual thing, it was a six-head team. If you
was on level ground, you wouldn't move too much in a day, but if you was
on steep ground, you could take six head of cattle and in places trail as

many as fifteen logs behind them. Just looked like a freight train. And lot of
times, just one trip a day is all you'd make. Bring in anywhere from fifteen
to twenty logs at a time. Take a half a day to go get'em. Maybe be two
o'clock before you ever got'em all trailed together and ready to go out
with'em. And that one trip a day's all you'd make 'cause you might be pull-
ing two mile, two mile and a half. Pull so far and stop and rest, you see.
I've worked all day many a day and not even get one log to the mill.
Maybe take two days to get one log out pulling him all the way. Flat
ground. Big logs was hard to move. Sometimes you'd walk up to one lying
on the ground and it was all you could do to see over the top of it. They
don't have nothing like that no more. When you go to moving one like that,
you've got to have something. Now they've got equipment to move it with,
but we didn't have nothing but cattle and horses. We had double and single
and triple tackle blocks—blocks with rollers in them. Put two of them to-
gether, and sometimes put three of them together. Thread three into two
and then on down into one. Sometimes we'd have to do that to move it.
And then a few times I've had as high as twelve head of cattle to one log.
Me and my buddy had three yokes apiece, and we'd put all twelve to some
of the big stuff to move it. It'd be so big they'd have to bore it and put
powder guns in it to split it before it'd ever go on the saw carriage—quarter
it up. You don't see nothing like that no more. Not in this country. It's all
gone.
Back then they wasn't no roads. Roads was just what you made wherever
you went through. If we was going to move a whole lot of logs, and a good
distance, we used corduroy roads. You'd use that three, maybe six months.
Fix the road just for that. Them logs going over it would keep the dirt off
the top of the pole for a while, and the logs would just slide across the poles.
That would make them slip across easy. But you wouldn't hardly be able to
snake on it for much more than three months because the poles would keep
getting pressed down into the dirt from heavy logs going over them until the
dirt would be level with the tops of the poles, and then you'd just have the
road.
Where the road had a dip in it, put long poles in it we called bull poles to
hold those logs up and get them over the dip.
Them corduroys had to run just about the way they grade a highway
now. What you chopped out with an axe was the road you had then—or
what you dug with a mattock and shovel or one of those old scrapes or slip
pans. Only way you ever used that wheel scrape would be building a road
to where a sawmill was going to be sitting for three or four years.
Now if it was to come a dry spell like this, you'd turn branches into the
road to make it muddy and to make it slicker to pull on. The rainier the
weather was, and the harder the ground was froze, the more you could

============================================================

move and the better you got along with it. Logging was better in the winter
than it was in the summertime 'cause the ground froze. You really didn't
have better weather; just better logging weather, 'cause it was cold and the
ground froze. You'd pull a few loads on the road, and it freezing ice, and
that's when you could move a whole lot. When it would go to freezing and
getting icy, that would be the time to get the logs. When it was too rough
for most people to get out of the house, well that's when loggers worked and
got a whole lot done. I never did quit on account of rough weather. That
was the best time to move stuff.
Now, when you go to pulling a log, you've got to find the heavy side. A
log will run a certain way. It has a bottom and a top. There's a heavy side
on all of them, and he'll pull on that heavy side. Then knock off that lead-
ing edge with an axe. Slope the leading edge. That makes it run easier—

PLATE 265 
In order to drag several logs out of the woods together instead of having
to drag each separately, the logs are hooked together with "trailer grabs"—metal
hooks connected by swivel links so the logs can turn independently—and two links of
chain.
PLATE 266 When the logs are hooked together, Millard's horse, Charley, is backed
up to the lead log and chained to it via the singletree at the end of his harness, and a
"J-grab" or "header grab" that connerts the singletree to the lead log. At a signal
from Jack, Millard's son, Charley lunges forward to get the train of logs moving.

keeps it from kicking up dirt in front of it and slowing it down. That's
what we call nosing a log. And in the summer, you nose it and bark it too.
You can pull a heavy log that way 'cause it will be slick.
And you want to put your biggest log in front, your next biggest one
behind, and so on down to the last. Leave about eight inches in between
them to get slack. You just keep trailing on back. You have a swivel in the
middle of your grab chain that will let the log turn the length of the chain.
I've pulled eighteen and twenty logs in a line that way. That was on steep
ground. We used a J-grab on that header [biggest] log. Put your J-grab on
that. See, if you fix your road right, they'll be a lot of places where you can
let [the line of logs] run by theirselves [without being pulled by the steers].
Sometimes they'll run as far as a mile and a half. In them places you jay
your steers off and let the logs go on by theirselves.
And whenever you go to jay, you just turn your spread hook over and put
it in that grab and your spread hook turns loose and it just goes right on by.
I ve jayed off eighteen and twenty of them, and the cracker [the last log in
the string] would go past and he'd be a foot off the ground when he passed.
He'd be going as fast as any of these cars that go down through here [on the
highway past our house] a'racing. That gets your team out of the way
so they don't get run over 'cause it's exactly like a freight train behind'em,
and I mean by the time they passed, they would really be flying. Over there
in the Smokies, you turn some of them loose on some of them mountains
and it'd sound like a thunder storm. You could hear them a'roaring for
miles.

It was a long time before they ever done that jaying with steers. Instead
they had old big log chains that weighed about a hundred an' fifty pounds.
I guess the inside of the links was about six inches. They was made out of
three-quarter- or seven-eighths-inch stuff. Well, they was so heavy it'd take
two men to handle one of them. And they called that a dull chain. If the
ground was steep enough for a log to run, you'd put that dull chain around
it along about four feet from the front end of the header and that made the
son-of-a-gun plow in the ground till it wouldn't run and hurt your steers.
Then, whenever you got down to leveler ground where it wouldn't run,
you'd unhook the chain and the log would slip over it and you'd go on with
it.
Then they got to learning steers to where they'd jay. After they learn it,
whenever they start to one of them jay places after three or four trails of logs
passed them for four or five days in a row, they wouldn't even stop in the
hole. They'd run plumb on through it getting out of the way. Now they
moved!
But if the ground's not level enough for a team to get out of the way
when you jay off, you've got to dig that J-hole into the road bank for them to
get into 'cause when those logs run, they've got to get in that so the logs can
pass them up and leave them standing there. They can't stay in front of the
logs 'cause the logs run so fast they'll kill'em—break their legs and kill'em.
We broke a few steers' legs, and two or three's necks.
Actually, I didn't never kill none myself, but I've skint'em all over. And I
never was hurt myself. Just skinned. Get jerked down or knocked down.
Shins skint all over. Elbows. Knees. Maybe a limb fly up and hit you across
the back or shoulder or something. You'd be sore for three-four days. But as
long as I worked'em, I never did get no broken bones.
Now those teams, we never did switch jobs much. We had our job skid-
ding every day. When we worked at that, that was every day business.
Nobody didn't fool with your teams of cattle. Nobody didn't fool with what
you drove. I drove and fed and took care of mine, and the other feller done
the same way with his. Nobody didn't fool with your stuff.
Sometimes we'd switch our driving horses and wagons when one driver
would be out planting crops or something and we'd be hauling acid wood
in the summer and not using the cattle. Take somebody's else's team like
that, you know. But every man had his team and he fed and took care
of'em, and he worked'em and he worked'em every day. Nobody didn't
swap back like they do trucks now, you know: one drive one day and one
the next. That didn't go. Whenever you got your team, you kept it.
Well, the cattle knowed who their boss was so a stranger couldn't do
nothing with them nohow. Somebody else fooling with them, it'd take'em
two or three weeks to get used to him before he could get any work out of

them. A steer's sort of a quare thing, the majority of'em is. Some of em's
different, but the majority has more or less got one master, and that's all
that gets anything out of them. They won't work for half a dozen people at
one time. They're strange characters on that. They're called a dumb brute,
but they're a long way from being dumb. They're well-educated when it
comes to that kind of business 'cause they know who's who.
Back whenever we worked steers, we raised them all the time. Back then
we had cattle. They was took to the mountains and turned loose. Lots of
times they was left in the mountains all winter—all except heifers and cows
that was going to bring calves. You bring them in. And we marked them—
ear marks. Every outfit and every family had his mark and it was registered
at Raleigh. Once or twice you might hear of one being stole, but that was
something people didn't do back then. They didn't take the other feller's
stuff. They was different to what they are now. They wouldn't bother noth-
ing that didn't belong to them. You didn't run into none of that—hardly
ever. Our older generation wouldn't be bothered, nor they wouldn't bother
nobody.
And we wouldn't log'em much until they was three years old. Then some
of them we might work as much as three years—never over four years.
Now if the logs was going to be hauled a long ways, you'd haul them
with teams and wagons. Wheels six-foot high—great big old wide tire
on'em. Took six head of cattle—three yokes of oxen to a wagon. You had
the big pair behind next to the wheels, and you called them your wheelers.
The smaller ones went up front to lead with, and they were your lead cattle.
In other words, the front ones did the controlling of the work. And the
number of teams you used depended on the size of the logs and the distance
you were going.
It took two men to operate one of those wagons. They were heavy con-
cerns. Mud knee-deep. Them old wagons would cut down deep.
Now the team that was on the wheel—the ones that carried the wagon
tongue—now they caught it rough. That front wheel would hit a rock, you
know, and that tongue would hit that steer hard if they was making any
speed—especially downhill. It'd just about knock'em off their feet. I've
seen'em knocked plumb down to their knees. See, you've got that tongue
right in that yoke, and if a front wheel hits rock or something solid, the
tongue slams over and it hits that steer and jerks this other one's weight on
him too. Now that was rough on'em. Really hard on'em. Wagoning is hard
work on'em. Reason it took two men was one to drive, and one to run the
brake. You've got a brake on that wagon. The brakeman walked behind—
had a steel guide with notches on it. You started going downhill, and he'd
just mash down on that brake handle and hook it in one of them notches. If
it got to going too fast, you just rare down on it and hook it in another one.

Then when the wagon got down the hill and went to getting too hard to
pull, why he'd raise it a notch, you see? And he walked behind and the
driver walked up front. Didn't have reins. He'd just talk to'em and they'd
mind.
They'd pull wagons more with mules back then than they did with horses
'cause a mule would go further and didn't take hardly as much to feed him,
and he was much faster with a wagon than a horse was. You can feed a
mule—just feed him of a night—put him in plenty to eat tonight and just
get him used to that and you won't have to feed him no more till tomorrow
night. You've got to feed a horse three times a day to hold him up if you're
working him hard, but a mule, you don't. So they'd use a mule—haul long
distances with'em and just feed'em once a day.
Now steers were the same way. You don't have to feed them but once a
dav if you feed'em good. You can take and feed'em—like we fed'em cot-
tonseed meal and hulls—and feed'em plenty of a night. They've got four
stomachs, you know. What one eats tonight, he'll belch that up and chew
his cud, and what he eats tonight don't do him no good until tomorrow.
He's got to belch that up and chew it and let it go back into that other
stomach tomorrow before it does him any good. And then they'd eat buds
along the road, you know, and leaves and so forth and so on while you was
working'em. They'd be a'grazing along while you was loading and resting
them. See, they'd fill that one stomach up there where they'd chewed that
other out, and they you'd lay the cottonseed meal and hulls to them that
night and that'd finish it. So that one big meal a night was all they needed,
and they'd stay fat all the time. That was another advantage of having
them.
To conclude this section, we asked Millard to explain to us something of
the economics of one of the old operations—how the orders came in, what
sort of money was involved, etc.
We just cut the best back then—the biggest and smoothest. If you want
to saw out good lumber, you've got to have good trees. Back whenever we
was logging with oxen, we didn't cut nothing but the best because there
wasn't no sale for nothing else, hardly, and even what we got out didn't
bring much. We hauled many of a load of number one timber—oak boards
that was eighteen to twenty inches wide and sixteen foot long. Wide enough
to almost make a table top. And it was clear all the way through. And we
hauled it from the mill to a railroad siding and loaded it inside a railroad
car and shipped it to Chicago for twelve dollars a thousand [feet]. The same
lumber now would run at least eight hundred dollars for the same amount.
We got twelve out of it. And it had to be good to sell at all. If it wasn't the
best, you just didn't sell any of it. Cherry and walnut and oak sold better

than any of it did. And we sold curly walnut, curly birch, curly cherry and
curly maple. And it wouldn't bring but twelve or fifteen dollars a thousand!
And there was big chestnut. I've cut chestnut trees that had twenty-one
cord of wood in them. Load a full railroad car load of wood out of one tree.
I've cut a lot of it six and seven foot across the stump. And chestnut wasn't
worth nothing till Champion Fibre Company went to making a lot of
paper. And even then it was a dollar twenty-five a cord—that was a hun-
dred sixty foot. A cord and a quarter is actually what you sold. And that
was to cut it and take it to the mill! And a lot of chestnut sold for light
poles and phone poles for a long time. Back years ago, young chestnut was
about the straightest thing growed in the woods. We used to get them out
and load'em on a car fifty foot long and them be ten inches at the little end.
Put them on flat cars. We loaded them with a block and tackle and a team
of horses.
And back in them old dark coves in the Smokies they used to be a lot of
sugar maple that would go up six foot across the stump. And it was just as
curly as it could be—what they called bird's eye back then. Lord have
mercy, if a man had it now, what would it be worth? And they made floor-
ing out of it, now. And then a lot of it went to Chicago where they made
furniture out of it. And some got gunstocks made out of it. And a lot of it
was exported to Finland and Sweden. It was precut here to where it could
be handled and put on the boat—four-by-twelves, six-by-sixes, six-by-eights.
And then they recut it down to smaller sizes over there. What they done
with it, I don't know. And then black walnut went to Sweden too.
But we'd start logging wherever the kind of trees we wanted were. We'd
cut one kind one time and another the next. Maybe be maple one time,
maybe poplar one time, and maybe walnut or oak. We cut more oak than
anything 'cause there was more of it than anything else.
So we'd just go where the most of it was, and the best.
A lot of times, we'd get orders, and whatever they'd order, you'd cut. A
car would hold about twelve or fifteen thousand feet, so we'd get orders for
a car load at a time, you see. Mostly oak, and then we got a whole lot for
hickory, see, to make wagons out of.
But we would go to the depot and tell the depot agent, and they would
have the cars sent for when we'd be ready to load. They were set on the side
and the brake was left on, and if we needed to move them, we just took the
brake off and moved them down to where we wanted them and then
tighten the brake back. Then you'd load.
Back then, the Government didn't own nothing. It was all private or
company land. The Government never went to buying land until right after
the Depression. When things started picking back up, the Government went
to buying land. Sometimes they did it, they claimed, to preserve the forest.

They might buy up a big company, or shut'em down. Did it in 1925 with
the Suncrest Lumber Company. There's timber there that never has been
cut yet. But mostly they didn't buy land until along about '33.
Then, after World War II, they had everything took over, and if you
logged any at all, you had to have an OPA card to do it. You had to take it
to the rationing board and get them to approve it to get your card. I know,
because there was one time during all that that I had over two hundred and
fifty thousand feet laying on the ground ahead of me and me logging with
three pair of horses.
It was all stamps then. You had to have that stamp before you could buy
anything. The stamp wouldn't buy you nothing. And your money wouldn't
buy nothing if you didn't have the stamp. On lumber, if you didn't have
that stamp, you couldn't buy it. They was trying to allot it out to where
everybody'd get a equal share. Lumber was still going that way till plumb
up after '46. And see, there was a ceiling price on it. They couldn't sell it
but for only so much. Seems to me like it was selling for forty-five and fifty
dollars a thousand then. See, there was a ceiling price on the lumber, a ceil-
ing price on cattle, a ceiling price on hogs—there was a ceiling on every-
thing regardless of what someone would give you for it. That set price was
all you was allowed to sell it for. The millionaire couldn't buy no more than
the poor man could. You were allowed so much at such a price, and that's
all you could get. If you wanted to build a new house, they would allot you
so much lumber for it. You couldn't get but so much. You couldn't get out
here and build any kind of house you wanted. You built according to the
size of your family, and then you got so much lumber to do that with, you
see?
And now that about takes us up to the more modern logging with trucks
and all that.
SAWMILLING
Back then you took your sawmill to the woods with you. You'd put it
back in the mountains middleways of what territory you was going to log.
Then you'd pull logs into it from all around, saw them up, and then move
your lumber out. It would have cost too much to move the logs out if you
had very many of them to move. You wagoned some, but you wouldn't
wagon too many.
You just took the mill to the woods, maybe saw a half-million feet or
something like that at the place, and then move the mill to the next place.
Just kept on moving it back into the woods as you went so you could pull
your logs to it on the ground. And the lumber, then, it was all hauled out
on wagons and took to a railroad.

The sawmill had to be in kind of a flat place—a place where there was
plenty of water on account of your boiler. You had to have plenty of steam.
Had to have it on a good-sized branch. And then, too, they was a lot of
wood moved by branches. See, they had flumes. I don't guess none of you's
ever seen a flume. It's just a water trough made out of twelve-inch-wide oak
boards, and two of them nailed together here in a trough—"V"-shaped. Or
some of them be twenty-four inches wide and wouldn't be "V"-shaped.
Then you turn water into them. Maybe go four or five miles back in on the
head of that branch where it come out of the mountain and run good, and
build what you called a splash dam—just a dam that would fill up over-
night, you know. Hold several hundred gallons of water. Next morning,
then, turn the water into that flume trough and go to putting wood in
it—just one stick of wood right against the other one. The water'd take it
down. It'd maybe go three or four miles like that.
Then somebody would be down there at the lower end where it levelled
out picking it up and loading it on a wagon and taking it to a railroad car.
That was acid wood, mostly. And lumber too. They'd pick up lumber the
same way after it was sawed.
See, that was a cheaper way of moving it, and it saved a lot of time. Take
a pretty good while to build one of them flumes, but they'd keep on lasting.
Wasn't too much repair to do on them either. If the water went to freezing,
they'd take the water out of it so there wouldn't be nothing to break it
down. And then if it got a whole lot of frost on it, it'd run without water. It
would run on that ice. But lots of times that was too fast. It'd run so fast
it'd jump the trough 'cause there's places that'd have to be curved on it.
PLATE 271 
Acid wood 
(chestnut)
was essential for the production of
paper. Companies like Champion Inter-
national would build miles of flumes up
into the mountains in order to get this
acid wood out. A flume would begin
high in a watershed nearly at the head
of the creek. A splash dam at the head
of the flume would hold water to be
turned into the flume. The chestnut
would be cut into five-foot lengths and
split up and stacked beside the flume at
intervals along its length during dry
weather. Then, in wet weather when the
stream was running full, water would be
turned into the flume at the splash dam
and the split wood would be loaded
into it and carried to its end. The flume
pictured here was on Big East Fork.

And it wasn't easy to carry that wood back uphill to put back in. It shore
wasn't!
But a two-inch branch would carry that. You'd cut the acid wood and
pile it up all along the flume, and then when you'd turn the water into it
from that splash dam, why just put the wood in. Then that flume would be
full all the time. You'd flume enough wood there to haul a dozen teams,
then, all day long on down to the railroad siding. Load it on a car.
But now that sawmill: it took a big inch pipe running free about all the
time running water for the mill. And then the branch run through under
the saw and carried the sawdust off. They used to put the sawdust in the
creeks there if they was one close enough to where they could have that saw
box right over the creek. Then you wouldn't have to have nobody to move
no dust. The branch would wash it off—take it away.
The mills was steam engines—steam boiler and steam engines. Fired him
up and got a good head of steam up—enough to pull the engine—and you
throwed the steam on the engine and that's what done your sawing. Had
your saw just like they've got it now, but it was pulled with steam in place
of gasoline engines.
PLATE 274 
Narrow-gauge railroads were also used for hauling large logs, surh as
balsam, to the mill. Often trestles were required, and a man like Rube Mull and his
crew would be railed in to build them. This trestle probably went up into Little East
Fork, an area that is now the Pisgah National Forest. (Photo courtesy of Champion

they were cut to the loading area.

"stiff-necked loader"), visible in this
photograph on the tracks beyond the
steam engine, would load the logs onto
the railroad cars for the trip to the mill.
When one car was filled, the loader
would pull off the main track onto a
short siding so that the engineer of the
train could move another empty car
into position to be loaded. (Photo cour-

One of them steam boilers—one to pull a big mill—was a pretty good-
sized thing, and the engines were just about twenty horsepower. Wasn't
none of them over twenty horsepower.
They was a little drive wheel—about an eight-inch wheel—on that en-
gine and it was cast iron. Heavy son-of-a-gun. And when that thing got
started and picked up his speed, why it took a lot to slow that old big cast
iron wheel down. Long as you kept a boiler with plenty of fire and water in
it vou could have steam to saw on. Had a pop-off valve on it. They only
got so hot and then the steam pressure would open it up to keep it from
blowing up. When that pop-off valve opened, it was ready to go to sawing
then! If a man knowed how to fire one, he could just about keep that pop-
off valve going all day long, 'cause while they was changing logs, his steam
would build back up and it would pop again. Back when timber was so
heavy and so big, it took'em a good while to saw a log up.
The way they operated was something similar to what they operate now.

One outfit would saw—he'd do customer sawing but the most of the time
he logged his own mill and just sold the lumber. Buy timber, you know, and
sell the lumber. Once in a while there'd be somebody haul some logs in on
wagons wanting it sawed to build a barn or a house. They'd come in and
swap work instead of paying. Most of the time if they wanted lumber,
they'd just come and work around the mill or work in the woods a few
days, you see, and take their pay in lumber. And that was one of the ways
they got their building material back then. Sometimes it was a problem get-
ting men to work in the woods and the mill both 'cause the population was
thin then. They wasn't too many people. So that was the way they'd do.
They'd swap work for something they needed.
If they were going to be sawing there for a long time, they'd build a
bunkhouse for the men working the mill. Shirley [Millard's wife] ran the
bunkhouse sometimes and cooked for the men. We had our own little place
to stay in, and the men stayed in the camp. Then, when the sawmill moved
out, they left the camp behind. People coming in gathering herbs could stay
there, or hunters. Sometimes moonshiners. They got used a lot, so they were
kept up. Someone would come along and stay over a night or two, and do a
repair here and there to keep it up, and the next man the same way. Some
of them camps stayed there for years and years that way.
MODERN LOGGING
Back then when we was working steers, they wasn't such a thing as a
truck. You either skidded your logs to a sawmill, or brought them to a
wagon. They wasn't no trucks used in the woods up' till '35, and they was
very few then. See, you didn't even have a dual-wheel truck. The first one
of them was made in '32. And the trucks that was first used back then was
pulled with a one-wheel sprocket drive. They didn't even have a drive shaft
on'em. They was just one wheel that pulled.
And they wasn't no roads to run'em on because everything that was
hauled was hauled with teams and wagons and steers and wagons and it
was just out of one mudhole into another one. They wasn't nowhere for'em
to go so they wasn't no good, see?
But the truck took the place of the wagon to start with. He only delivered
the lumber after it was ready to load on the railroad car. After he took the
place of the wagon, why then he gradually went to going back in the woods
and taking the place of the horses and steers. They got to building roads
and putting them back in the woods. But they wasn't too much of that
done, now, until up in '37 and '38 when they started taking them back in
the woods.
The first trucks was a very small rig. Well, they hauled an awful load for

============================================================
PAGE 286
============================================================

LOGGING 
289
their time, but they didn't move too much because they was too small, and
their motors was so small they didn't have much power. I know you know
what an A-model Ford is. Well, you know about what you can move with a
A-model motor. Well, now, that's the size motor they had in them. Four-
cvlinder Chevrolet. It was they same size motor the A-model was. A-model
was about as strong an order as they was, so you can tell by that how much
you could move with it. That's the way it started out. If you had one you
could haul three-quarters of a cord of wood on, you really had a good
truck; but you could take a team and wagon and haul a full cord! And you
couldn't go much faster in a truck than you could with a team and wagon
because they wasn't no roads. So if you wasn't hauling something but six or
eight or ten miles, you could get along just as good with a good team and
wagon as you could with a truck.
But then, you see, the state took the roads over and they got to building
roads. Back then they wasn't no road tax, and the way you built a road
back in them days was with what they called a poll tax. You paid two dol-
lars a year to vote. That was poll tax. Well, in place of paying any taxes [in
cash], you worked on the road one day out of the year for that poll tax.
You either had to work a day yourself, or hire a man to work in your place.
And that's all the road work they was. They wasn't no state taxes or county
taxes or nothing on the roads, so the individuals kept them up with that one
day of work. And then maybe going by somebody's house here along the
edge of their field it'd get real bad, and the field would be covered over in
rock, and they'd want to get them rock out of the way where he was tend-
ing his field, so he'd haul them rock and pile them in the road and work it
down so far [in distance]. Well now, that's the kind of work there was.
And then the state went to charging taxes and took the roads over and
just went to building strips here, yonder and about, and trucks then got to
operating and cars got to operating and they got to raising the tax on gaso-
line and stuff, and that there's what made the whole thing go to building.
But see, all during that time they wasn't no way for it to build because
they wasn't taking no taxes in.
It was just like—if you started to go somewhere, they was half the time
it'd just be like hitting that field out there; getting out there and picking out
a hard place in the field to drive on and hoping it would hold up a few days
for you to haul over. Keep somebody busy filling up the potholes where
you'd mire down. Somebody was hauling rock all the time filling up the
ruts. That's the only way you went.
When it rained, you done work whenever you had teams and wagons,
but you didn't do nothing when you first started off with trucks. When it
set in to raining, they stayed parked 'cause you couldn't get nowhere with
'em. If you was hauling downhill where it was fairly steep, you could take a

============================================================

good team and hook it in front of one of the trucks and pull him up the
mountain and load him. He'd come down all right! But he sure wouldn't
go up. Every time he went up there, you had to pull him up! Pull him
up there and get him pulled around, and then you could load him and
come on out. But that was the way you done it, and the only way you
could do it then.
[Even when the first dual-wheel trucks came it, it was hard. You could
haul the logs to the truck with a dozer and load it, or drive on in and if you
got stuck, get the dozer to pull you out, or put a twenty-foot pole in between
the dual wheels and run the truck on that pole until you got out of the
mud.] I've poled out of many a mudhole like that. That, or pull out with a
pair of horses or a skidder if you were close to one. Or if you was hauling
downhill, put on a set of chains and go in, and then take'em off when you
brought him out.
You know, you could outrun one of them old trucks anywhere 'cause that
[drive] sprocket wouldn't let it go but so fast—it wouldn't turn but so
fast. You could turn one down a 45 per cent grade and outrun it if you
wanted to 'cause it wouldn't go no faster. It just had one speed, and when
it got up that far, that's as fast as it would go!
Now coming on up to more recent times, I worked for the Dayton
Rubber Company in Waynesville, North Carolina, for three years. That was
'50, '51, and '52. I quit logging and went over there and went to work.
Thought I wouldn't log no more. Got kinda aggravated at it. I just decided
I'd quit a while. Daddy kept on talking to me trying to get me to quit log-
ging altogether and go to work on the public works.
So I went to Dayton, and I built pickers there for cotton mills. It was an
assembly line. And then about the last sixteen months that I was there, I
was on the experimental end of it. We made some tires over there and put
them on trucks, and we run some on them semitrailers a hundred and ten
thousand miles and half the tread wasn't even wore off them. They
wouldn't never let nothing like that get on the market. That was when they
come out with that Double Eagle for a car that was guaranteed for sixty
thousand miles. But they was so high that poor people couldn't afford'em so
they just quit making them. But they could make a tire there that would
wear a car out.
And then during the war they made them pontoon bridges; and they
made them throwaway tanks out of rubber that they dropped off planes
whenever they was emptied. And they made some tanks that held as much
as five hundred gallons, and they could take one of them tanks and take a
fifty-caliber machine gun and shoot all the way through that thing and they
wouldn't be three quarts of gas spill out of it. There was something in that

rubber that when the gasoline hit it, it made the rubber dissolve and seal
that hole.
Then when the war was over, they just kept adding on to the plant, went
to making radiator hose and, well, just anything that was rubber. And syn-
thetic sponge. I guess they hire something like five thousand over there now
'cause they're spread out all over that bottom. I've cut tobacco right out
through that bottom right where that thing's setting. It belonged to old man
Jule Welch.
But when I first started working there, me and Shirley got a prize there
for being the youngest married couple. It was ten pounds of sugar for the
prize. That was in July before they started putting all the machinery in.
They started putting the machinery in the Monday after that. I made a dol-
lar to a dollar and a half a day there.
And I'd been there about three months when I went to logging for
Genett's [Lumber Company]. I worked graveyard shift at the Dayton
Rubber Company—went in at eleven o'clock and come out at seven—and
then crawled in my truck and went to the woods. I'd get in home sometimes
six-thirty or seven—lots of times eight o'clock in the night; and then go

back to Dayton at eleven that same night and do it again. I'd work that way-
till Saturday. Quit about four o'clock Saturday evening and I'd sleep from
then till about eleven o'clock Sunday night.
Yeah, I worked there on graveyard and logged every day. Shore did.
They was weeks—Shirley'll tell you herself [she did]—they was weeks that
I never slept six hours a week. And by God I was working too. I wasn't lay-
ing around. I was working.
Whenever I'd come in on Saturday evening—the kids was all small—I'd
take them to a drive-in show, and it'd take her thirty minutes to get me
woke up to get them back home. And I'd fall into bed, and about dinner-
time on Sunday, I'd get back up. I'd make up for [lost sleep] on those
weekends.
But I'm a son-of-a-bitch if I didn't go week on top of week and never
sleep more than six or eight hours a full week. Took a whole lot of pills—
them there no-sleep pills. I took a whole lot of them, and a whole lot of that
dope to keep from going to sleep. And drank a whole lot. Drunk a whole lot
and worked all the time too.
But while I was logging, I was either operating a skidder or driving truck
about all the time. I was hauling off a place over there called Wolf Pen,
and couldn't get nobody that could drive a truck and get out of there with
no load. It was steep and they'd mire up too much. Had to drive myself to
get anything done. Had two trucks. I'd drive one of them and an old Moss
boy drove the other. Contracting for Genett. You got paid for what the log
was worth in board feet—all contract work.
Genett would buy a boundary. You know what that is? It's not any cer-
tain size territory. The Forest Service just marks an area off—blazes it with
paint. They either mark the trees they want cut, or they tell you to clear-cut
and you take what you want. Used to be that way. Now [when you clear-
cut] you have to take it all. Firewood and all.
But Genett would bid on that boundary, and if they got it, I'd go cut it
and bring the timber to the mill. And then sometimes I'd buy a boundary
myself and go cut it and sell it to Genett. I made more money that way.
I've went many a time in the winter—go in in the daytime and load up
and the ground would thaw till I couldn't get out. I'd mire down and just
back out of the hole. Know I couldn't get through it. And I'd stay there till
three or four in the morning till the ground would freeze down again
enough for me to get out. Take my load on in and come on back and go
back to work then. Get out one for the next morning. But now that's hard
work. I rolled a load of logs off on myself over yonder at Genett's one time.
I was about half asleep. They'd filled up a hole—I guess it was five-foot
deep where we'd wallered it out with the trucks. They'd filled it up with
sawdust, and it was soft, and I pulled up to the edge of it and went to

five of them logs rolled over me. Mashed me till my eyes swelled shut. I
didn't even know when my kidneys acted or my bowels moved for over a
week. And you know it never broke a bone? But now it shore messed my
muscles up! But I was in the sawdust, see? They'd just filled the hole up
with the dozer and smoothed it over, and them logs just rolled over me
and buried me in that sawdust. 'Course the sawdust was hard. Hard enough
that, God, I'll tell you, it give me a mashing. I was in the millyard, and they
shut the saw down and all run to me, and one of'em run in and called the
ambulance. They thought it'd killed me. I told'em to cancel the ambulance
call 'cause they wasn't nothing wrong with me. Rolled around on the
ground there a few minutes and finally made it up and got up and got in
the truck and thought I'd go back to the woods and get another load. But
time I got to the foot of the mountain, I seen I couldn't load when I got
there. So I drove on to the house; and when I got to the house, I couldn't
get on to the house, and they took me to the doctor. I was out about two
weeks, I think, before I went back. Went right back at it again. Didn't have
enough sense to quit.
After I quit Dayton, I went back to logging full time. I was using a truck
and skidder and horse all. Two trucks. Two of my own trucks. Had some-
body else driving one.
Mostly we hauled overloaded. Eighteen thousand pounds to the axle is
what you're supposed to carry. That's back axle. Front axle you're not
supposed to carry but twelve. That was the limit. But I was carrying way
over that. And it was a cent-and-a-half a pound plus a fifty-dollar fine plus
three-cent-and-a-half a pound for what you had over plus court costs—if
they caught you. That'd wipe out [the profits of] several trips when they got
done with you. You'd already worked about two weeks for nothing when
they caught you. And then that'd make the son-of-a-bitches go to watching
you closer then.
Here we asked if he really ran overloaded that much, and Shirley an-
swered, "Well he done it!" Millard laughed, "I done it and I mean I done
it plenty too."
I lived over in North Carolina. I outsmarted Fergy [nickname for a state
patrolman who is legendary in this part of the country] a few times, and
you were sharp when you done that.
They come up down here—I was parked right above that State Line beer
joint on the old 441—but they come up there that evening just a little be-
fore dark, and I was overloaded to hell and back, and Fergy'd been trying
to catch me. And him and the Macon County Sheriff come up/there and
looked the truck over. Ralph

going home and seen them there and come on down to my house and told
me. Says, "Buck,"' he says, "they're going to get you tonight."
I says, "Well, maybe not."'
He says, "I wish they was some way or 'nother you could go around and
dodge'em."
I says, "I'll figure out something before I leave out."
Earl [one of Millard's sons] was out a'courting that night, and he come
in about eleven and he says, "Daddy," he says, "they're sure going to get
you whenever you start through in the morning."
I says, "Ah, maybe not, son." And I told Shirley, I says, "Heat the coffee
up. I'm gonna drink me some coffee and I believe I'll pull out."
She says, "Why, you're crazy."
I says, "You heat that coffeepot. Make me some coffee." I says, "I'll
figure out something."
Earl says, "What are you going to do, Daddy?" Says, "You know you've
got more sense than to pull out now." They was at Otto [North Carolina]
then.
I says, "Well," I says, "when I drink this coffee," I said, "you can take
me up there to the truck." I says, "I'm a'going through."
He says, "They're waiting on you." Says, "They'll get you too."
I says, "No, I don't think they will." Says, "I'm going up through High-
lands [North Carolina] and down through Cashiers into Sylva and leave
them son-of-a-bitches sitting there all night."
I come up there and crawled into the truck and went up across High-
lands and down through Cashiers. Come back through the next morning
about seven-thirty. They was still sitting a'waiting on me, and I just give'em
the highball as I come through.
Boy, old Fergy, you talk about a feller blowing his top, he shore raised
hell!
[Shirley: It's a wonder he hadn't shot the tires out from under the
truck!]
But I'd load the truck of a day and then get up anywhere from two to
three o'clock in the morning and go through at them time of hours. I was
going through to dodge'em, you see? Without they had a special report like
that, they very seldom ever got on the road before daylight. They was asleep
then, see, and before they got on the road, I went through. I didn't care for
them to stop me when I was empty. They couldn't do nothing then without
that load.
Old Fergy pulled me over down there one Sunday night, and I had on
three high racks of wood. I was going to Canton that time. Had on a Geor-
gia tag and had a North Carolina tag too. He wrote up a bunch of stuff on
me. I knowed he couldn't do nothing with me 'cause he didn't have the au-

thority to. Old J. P. Long was the head man. He lived over there at Bryson
City [North Carolina], and he was the pay man. Fergy says, "I'll have
Long to get you before you get to Sylva."
I says, "Well, he might and he might not."
So Fergy, he radioed Long to get me, and I knowed that Long would
come, too. So I just pulled out from the service station, and Fergy, he come
back to Franklin. I just pulled out from down there and went over out the
other side of Franklin and pulled up on the old road where they couldn't
see the truck nor nothing, and got out and walked back down there on the
side of the main road. And I hadn't been there more than about thirty min-
utes till old Long come through. And he come on to Franklin and missed
me. Come back and went back the other way, and I just waited about an
hour after he went back the other way. I knowed he'd seen I dodged him or
done something—or maybe thought I'd went back home. I waited till he'd
been gone about an hour and just crawled in the truck and went on
through to Canton.

But back then, I'd come in of a morning, go to the woods, load up, take
and park the truck, go home, and then go out early the next morning. I
used to cut and load that truck myself. If the boys come and helped me
load, all right. They helped me. But I'd cut and load three high racks on
that a day by myself. Sometimes Shirley'd go with me and cook dinner. And
she drove a mule and pulled in whole lot of stuff. And she'd scotch when
we'd roll big stuff up. Me and her'd put just as high a load of logs on a
truck as they put with these loaders—her scotching and me rolling with a
peavee.
And then I done it myself a lot. Put on three high racks—I mean three
high ones. High as any of em. I was pulling anywhere from thirty up as
high as thirty-four thousand pounds at a trip. And I'd cut that much wood
and load it in a day by myself after I come back from delivering the last
load to Sylva. And I was loading, by God, with my damn hands. I shore
was. [Pull the truck up to a high bank and roll the logs down poles that
went from the bank down onto the truck.] I'd cut and load that son-of-a-
gun as long as I could get a stick on. That was back, too, when things, you
know, was pretty cheap. I only got a dollar and ninety cents a thousand for
a long time, and pulling it to Sylva, too. Seems to me like the last I got was
two-twenty a thousand when I was doing all that heavy hauling. I'd pull
anywhere from ninety-six to a hundred and ten dollars a trip. Loading
heavy was the only way to make any money. Pull everything you could go
with. The trucks just stood it. Yeah. They just had to stand it. You had to
drive so far that you wanted to take all you could 'cause it took a whole lot
of gas to pull that load over there. And tires too.
But I'd just cut and load till I give out and sit and rest a while and go at
it again. Lots of times it'd be eleven o'clock when I got in of a night, and
then get up and pull out at two again. And then I'd rest on Sunday—get
drunk on Sunday and sleep all day.
I finally had to quit. Old Fergy got wise and I finally had to quit before
he did get me. I quit pulling and let Junior Bryson go to pulling for me
'cause I knowed Fergy'd get me if I kept on. Junior, he always hauled
about standard. He wouldn't overload. But he told me he'd pull it for me.
Well, he did pull it for me for sixty cents a thousand pounds. That was
cheaper than I could pull it by the time it took me to pull it and the wear
and tear and upkeep on the truck, so I just quit pulling it. Let him pull it.
It was hard work, but I'll tell you the reason I followed it. That's a thing
they's fast money in. It's hard work, but it's fast money. Pays good money.
I'd go out here by myself when the wages was seventy-five cents an hour
and make seventy-five dollars for me and that truck in a day? They was
people making four and five dollars a day and me making that kind of
money? I couldn't quit.

Even.' load of wood that goes through here—them big high loads of wood
that goes through here every day—is bringing at least a hundred and fifty
dollars a trip, and they's some of them making three trips a day. And
they're working at it like I worked at it [for myself and my family]. They're
well getting paid for it. Pine bringing seven twenty-five a thousand at the
mill, and them big trucks going through here with thirty and thirty-five
thousand pound every time they go through. You figure yourself whether
they're making any money or not.
They're making a pile of money. That's the reason I fooled with it all the
time and wouldn't fool with nothing else.
LOGGING CAMPS
Shirley Buchanan
During one point in his career as a logger, Millard Buchanan operated a
logging camp and worked fourteen men who lived on the job in bunkhouses
except for the weekends when they went home. Millard paid all expenses
such as stumpage on the timber, upkeep on the equipment, and food and
salaries for the men, and kept the balance of what he made selling the logs
to the Blue Ridge Lumber Company as his share.
The work went on all year, and so Shirley, his wife, and their children
hved at the camp with him. Her job, aside from taking care of the children,
was to cook for all the men. Curious about what that life was like for a
woman, Cam Bond and Lynnette Williams went to talk to her about that
life as well as her husband's work. About the latter, she said, "That's all he
ever done—log and cut pulpwood. That's what he loved to do. See the trees
fall."
What she said about the former follows.
We lived down here on Warwoman [in Rabun County]. That's where
we was logging at. The men would go out and log all day long. We had
some horses. One of them was named Scott and the other was named Harry
a pretty brown team of horses that they logged with. The men would eat
breakfast, then go out and harness them up and go off and come in at lunch
and eat; then they'd go off again and come back at night and eat again.
That was in 1947. We was there three or four years. We had fourteen
men besides me and Millard and the children. We had two to be born while
we was there.
We all lived in these big long camps. They built them out of wood. They
was little bunk houses in rows all the way out through here. Just enough for
a bed or two was all they had in them. Then ours was bigger because that's

============================================================
PAGE 297

where the men came to eat. We had our beds in [the back room], and our
big wood cook stove and big wood table and a cupboard to keep dishes in
[in the other part of the house]. We didn't have a whole lot of stuff.
We'd get up in the morning about five [to have the men fed] by the time
they went to work. At seven they'd done be fed and gone. I had this big old
dishpan that I made my biscuits up in. I knowed just how much milk to put
in. I had a big container that held about a half a gallon, and I put the milk
in that. Then I put my flour in the middle of this big pan and put a whole
lot of shortening in that and mixed up biscuits. We'd make about six or
eight pans full. That's a lot of biscuits for that many men. And we'd have
maybe oatmeal or applesauce or grits or gravy and eggs and jellies and but-
ter and all kinds of things like that to go with it. But it was really something
to get up of a morning and know you had to cook all that many biscuits.
They'd be good and brown cooked on that wood stove. You'd just put them
in there and in a few minutes you'd have a meal ready.
Then we had two great big old pots for coffee. We'd make one and
they'd drink it while the other was being made. The old cook stoves weren't
that big, and the one I went to housekeeping with was the one I had down
there. There wouldn't be too much room on top, but we cooked them three
meals on that stove and kept it going.
We usually kept pine knots to build a fire with [in the stove]. Keep the
fire quick with pine knots. And the kids enjoyed getting out and picking up
the pine knots and helping with the fires and stuff and cooking. Sometimes
that hot fire would burn some of the biscuits, but anyway they was all eat.
Every one of them.
Then I'd start right back after that [meal was finished]. By the time I
got the washing done on the rub board, I'd cook that meal at lunch, and
then cook again that evening. All I got done was washing, ironing, cooking,
and trying to keep house a little bit, though there wasn't much house to
keep. But we enjoyed it.
Now we didn't have refrigerators down there. We had just a stream that
went down the side of the back of the house out in the back yard. We kept
our butter and milk and stuff in that stream, and we'd go out there and get
it and it would be good and cold. For dinner, we'd buy other kinds of meat
that we could keep for several days, and we'd put it out there in that
branch and go get it. Sometimes we'd cook bologna, and we'd have a big
old platter and gravy and stuff to put on the table. And then at night we'd
have fried potatoes and green beans; and then the men liked onions so we'd
buy onions by the bushel, and we'd fry these onions. And we cooked
mashed potatoes— just anything you'd mention. Blackberries. We'd have
blackberry pies and all that stuff. But it was something to cook for that

many men, you know, and get all that ready and get it on the table. They'd
come in starved to death and eat a lot.
I didn't do all the cooking by myself because there was this old man that
stayed with us that [was from] Waynesville, North Carolina. His name was
Deacon Ledford, and he couldn't do no work. He was just a little feller.
And he couldn't do no work, but he could help me in the kitchen. They told
me when I went down there that I'd be cooking for these men, but that I'd
have a woman to come in there to help me. She didn't never show up. I
didn t ever see her. But Deacon come and helped me. He'd get up of the
morning and help make bLscuits and help me wash and put on the coffee
and stuff. And Millard helped a lot with the cooking and getting things
ready to eat.
1 hen we'd go to town every Saturday for groceries. It was fourteen miles
to town is how far it was. And it rained the most down there that I've ever
seen. We lived out on this dirt road, and sometimes we'd have to go out in

the sled to get to the highway, and then sled our groceries back in there.
That was the muddiest place, I know, that I've ever seen in my life. And
then during the week, as Millard took the logs out [to the sawmill], if we
needed anything else he'd bring it back in that day. But we went out once a
week and bought groceries. We'd be there by ourselves on the weekends, so
that's when we got all that done. We'd go out and bring in hay on the week-
ends for the horses. Buy big slabs of fatback to season with, and big buckets
of lard. Everything had to be bought in quantity because they was a lot of
us to feed. We traded out here at the stores in Clayton. Goldmine Branch is
the name of the place down on Warwoman [where we had to drive from].
Fourteen miles out of town. You can see the little road where it turns up to
go in there now. I'd like to go back in there sometime—see if it's still as
muddy as it used to be. Get the young'uns on that sled and go out to the
road and catch the truck from there on out. There was a lot of times they
had to pull the trucks out of there with the team because it'd be so muddy
they couldn't get out. Put on chains and everything.
Then the men would come back in Sunday night ready to work the next
day. During the week, we'd get through every night about seven-thirty or
eight o'clock. There wasn't nothing much to do after supper. They just eat
and went and rested. They had these instruments, and sometimes they'd
pick and sing and play outside the bunkhouse. Everybody seemed to enjoy
theirselves. They worked hard, but they enjoyed it.
And we'd have lots of company. They'd come from Waynesville and ev-
erywhere else. Our people all come to see us. And there'd be a lot of people
from Warwoman come to see us. Had a right smart of company. You know
"Preach" Parsons? He'd come out there and eat with us sometimes. He
remembered us way down in there.
Earl "Preach" Parsons
"Preach" Parsons was an employee of the Forest Service for most of his
adult life before he retired two years ago. His job took him to camp after
camp—large and small—checking on the operation and marking timber for
selective cutting. His career spans the development of the industry from
steers and up and down sash mills through band.mills (he remembers when
there were seven in Graham County, North Carolina alone) to modern
pulpwood operations and clear-cutting.
Now in retirement, we asked him to tell us about some of the camps he
saw and some of the experiences he had during his years in the field.
Now Millard and Shirley Buchanan—I visited in there. Their camp was
typical of the smaller ones. They didn't have many men in their camp com-
pared to the big commercial operations. Too many people get the concep-

tion that all camps were small—just little shacks out in the woods, you
know. Some logging camps took care of a hundred and two hundred men.
That meant they had to staff it, you know.
The people who cleaned up in the camp, they didn't call them maids.
There weren't women anyhow. They were old loggers that they called
"swampers." They swamped up. That's what they called it. And they were
meticulously clean. Boy oh boy, they were clean as a pin. Now there would
be bedbugs because, you know, out in the forest and everything, and men
traveling here and there with their belongings on their backs—they'd bring
them in. But they had their different treatments for bedbugs—kerosene and
all that sort of stuff. They were really clean. And you didn't make your
bunk. They made it for you. Clean sheets. It's surprising. It was really sur-
prising now.
And one of the things about a logging camp that was always interesting
to me was when they sat down to one of those long tables—and two hun-
dred men, now—you wouldn't hear a word spoken other than to pass some-
thing. There was no idle gossip, no talk about the day or anything. That

was just a place to eat, and that was just sort of an unwritten rule. Some-
body sat down and went to talking, boy, they'd give him a look. Not sup-
posed to do that in there. You sat in there, you ate your food, you got out.
Now they had good food. Particularly the better camps. And they were
proud of their food. Way back there it was hard to get good loggers. They
were scarce. So [the companies] would entice them with a good camp. The
pay probably wasn't too hot, but nevertheless, they had good hard staple
food, and clean surroundings. That was the pride of the logging super-
intendent—his camp. If a logger went off and talked about his camp [and
criticized it], boy, he was through.
At the same time, they had what they called logging tramps. Now they
were not tramps the way we think about a guy going down the road
without anything to eat, and unshaven and all that sort of stuff. Down on
the world. He just went from one logging camp to another. Probably no
folks or anything. And he'd stay in camp "X" a while—maybe two or three
months, maybe two or three weeks—and then he'd cross the mountain
walking and go to the next camp. He just made the rounds, you know. He
never drew his pay, and so he never was out of money. Whenever he hit that
camp again the next time, there was a paycheck there for him from the last
time. If it was a year later, or if it was five years later, there was a paycheck
waiting. So he had that little store-up all the way around.
And, as a rule, they were characters. They were quite dolorful. The men
loved for them to be in camp because they were entertaining. And then they

brought news from the other camps, you know, and from the outside world.
They liked to see them come.
The most colorful one was "Tramping Jimmy" Helton. I guess it was
forty or fifty years he just tramped the logging camps. And, buddy, he loved
it. He could tell some of the doggonest tales. Now I met Jimmy one time in
his later years. Some of the tales he'd tell, you couldn't print them. You
couldn't tell them before mixed company. His tales were something.
He might take a notion to leave, and he might take some driving grabs—
that's these short chains with hooks in the ends they use to hook logs to-
gether in trains [so they could pull six or eight logs at once down the
mountain]. Give the sign and the teamster way down there would take
off. Well, old Jimmy, he was liable to drive one hook into the end of a log
and the other into a stump, you know, and a freight train couldn't pull it.
Give the sign and then he'd take on off and they'd never see him for six
months. These tramps were very colorful, and they were sort of a necessity
to keep the morale up, too.
But loggers were proud of their camps. And the camps had to be good
because that was the main attraction for securing good labor. They'd take
them once or twice a month on the logging train to town to celebrate, you
know; and then back to the woods they'd go again. But those people just
got it in their blood just like anybody with anything else. That's all they
wanted. They worked hard. They worked under hard bosses. They were
fair, but they were hard. They had to be. They worked six days a week.
That old logger was quite a feller, I'll tell you that right now. He'd go out
and rough it. They had boots with [spikes in the soles], and they were
deadly weapons too. They were fighting men. But most of the time they'd
peel the bark off the logs, and they'd be as slick as grease; so they used these
hoots to walk the slick logs. They'd run those logs just like a coon. They
were experts in their line. Generally you think of a logger as just common
humdrum—anybody can do that. But it took an expert in every line of it.
They had these splash dams, for example. That was about 1905, I believe.
And they brought these river rats in from Pennsylvania and Ohio. That was
People trained to run logs on a river. Boy, they had to be just like a squirrel,
too. They lost a lot of people in this Chatooga River here.
The way that worked—they built these splash dams on the tributaries
going into the main Chatooga, like up Holcolm Greek. And what they'd do
is cut logs for three or four months and pile huge piles of them on the
banks. Then when the wet spell came and the rivers began to come up,
they'd roll these logs into the river bed and then open the splash dam above
them up, and that water would take them on down to the main Chatooga
River. They'd aim to drive a couple of million feet that one day. That's a
lot of logs, too. And then they rode those logs, floated them down in below

FOXFIRE 4
Toccoa, Georgia, someplace, and sawmill them. The [sawmills] had booms
across the river that would stop the logs, and they'd take them out. But once
those logs started, they had to keep them going. There wasn't anything such
as quitting. They had relief crews, but those crews were going all the time.
And men had to follow those loggers with food and everything else till those
logs went through. But those river rats had those boots so they could run the
logs—had about fifty spikes to each shoe.
There were experts in every area. Cutting and felling and notching. They
took pride when they'd fell a tree. They could take a tree a hundred and
fifty feet tall, and mark a spot out there on the ground around the hill, and
they'd drive a little stake in the ground. And those experts could almost fell
that tree to where it would finish driving that stake in the ground. It just
took people like that [with that kind of skill] because they couldn't split
their timber. If it split [while they were felling it], and that crack shot way
up the trunk, they'd ruin the log. And then it had to fall in position, partic-
ularly if they were logging with horses, so that the horse could pull it.
They'd throw that log in position, pointed the way they were supposed to be
carried out, so that the horse could get to them.
[Then if they weren't going to float the logs] they'd haul them to a nar-
row-gauge railroad. The best ones they had in the logging woods were the
railroads with Shay engines. They ran off cogs—like gears in a car—and
they were much more powerful [than conventional, piston driven engines].
Either that or they had tram roads. A tram didn't have an engine on it. It
had switchbacks. They'd load this car and let it go down the hill under its
own power. It came down to a point, and by the time it got to going a little
too fast, it turned upgrade. [That's the way the tracks were constructed.]
Then, just before it got to the apex of that upgrade, then here went another
track back this way [to take it farther down the hill]. Just before it went up
the upgrade, it would go through an automatic switch—a "frog"' they
called it—and that switch automatically just fell back over [after the car
went through heading uphill so that it would be in position to direct the car
onto the next downhill portion of track when it reached the apex of the up-
grade and headed back downhill]. Over here on Tray Mountain, they'd
switchback seven times getting down the mountain.
All those big logging camps are gone from this area now. There just isn't
the same type of stuff to cut. The small timber we have now doesn't necessi-
tate that kind of camp. And the mills now can't take care of the big logs
anyhow. They have to keep turning it and turning it on that carriage until
they lose at least one-third of that big log by just pruning it down to where
they can get it through the saw. They had those big bandsaws then that
could take a log that was six feet through—back then they cut for the
widest width they could get -but now they very seldom ever cut anything

The Champion Fibre Company operation at Sunburst (now Lake
Logan). The log trains would come into this area and dump their logs into the log
pond so the dirt would be washed off them before they were sawed. Soaking the grit
and dirt off would protect the saw blades. The logs would be drawn into the band mill
on a chute (visible leading from the second floor of the building at the head of the
lake) where they would be squared by a band saw. Then they would be moved into
the resaw area where twelve circle saws operating in tandem would saw them into
twelve boards at a time. This mill was shotgun fed and steam operated. Stacked lum-
ber is visible in the far background behind the stacks. A large operation like this one
might cut 100,000 feet of lumber a day, and have as many as five trains operating si-
multaneously hauling logs from the camps to the mill. (Photo courtesy of Champion

over ten inches. That's the marketable timber today. They take that lumber
and laminate it and put it together and come up with all the wide stuff they
need. So logging's entirely different now. Used to, they wouldn't fool with
that smaller stuff. They couldn't. Took too much work. What they wanted
was the big logs.
Will Zoellner
Will Zoellner worked as a blacksmith at several of the logging camps in
our area. When we asked him what a blacksmith's responsibilities were in
those camps, he said, "Everything in the world! The blacksmith had to do
it all! Even a damn table leg breaks in the kitchen, they send for the black-
smith."

"Everything in the world" included such jobs as repairing the band mills,
putting in new tracks and levelling them up for the carriage that carried
logs through the saw, repairing or rebuilding the log turners that rolled the
logs into the carriage, as well as making singletrees, tools, tool handles, and
wagon wheels. Sometimes the jobs required far more in terms of time than
most loggers were asked to give. Will might put in a ten-hour day, for ex-
ample, and then at the end of that day, when the steers were brought in
from the woods, put in an additional several hours shoeing them. He'd have
to put them in a set of stocks to hold them still, and then raise their legs one
at a time with a block and tackle to attach the two-part shoes. And some-
times the jobs were tedious and time consuming. Harnesses and traces, for
example, had to be made to fit the animals exactly so that they wouldn't
rub their hide raw. And the yokes he made for the steers had to fit exactly
so that the steers couldn't turn in them and get fouled or hurt themselves.
In addition, he had to know what type of wood was best for each job: he
had to know, for example, that a poplar yoke might be fine for use in plow-
ing in a field, but for heavy work, like logging, sweetgum was better as it
would give but wouldn't break under the tremendous strain put on it. His
job was vital because, in many ways, he kept the whole camp going.
Since he had so much experience with steers, we asked him first to tell us
a little about his work with them. Then we asked him to talk about the im-
portance of having the kind of well-run camps that "Preach" Parsons had
told us about.
When I first started logging, we used steers. I like to work with them.
Horses is hateful. They get to fretting. They get nervous. I don't like to
work with horses. Especially in muddy ground like in a creekhed or some-
thing. A horse, he don't want to stop there. He wants to run through that
and get out of it, but he can't run through with fifty tons. You have to take
your time to go through it. I'd rather fool with cattle with the exception of
getting in an old field or on a big mountain range with no water and no
ditches and no [obstacles] much. There a horse can be mighty handy. But
in the roughs I'll take a steer.
I started working with steers early. I used to break them when I was a
boy. I had five or six yoke of little ones. I'd play with them. I was working
with them, by gosh, when they were still sucking the cow—three or four
weeks old. I'd put a little bitty yoke on them and just drive them up and
down the road and let them drag a bush or a chain cr something between
them, and I never would have no trouble. They got used to it. And when
you'd take them out, after maybe two days you holler "whoa" to them and
they'll stop just like anything else. They get onto it quick, young. Especially
if you handle them every day. Later Id break thcm lo make a living with.

============================================================

PLATE 290 Will Zoellner (center) with five yokes of steers.
I've logged with them; I've put harness on them and plowed them single
like a mule. They'd do anything.
But they've got to be over three years old [to do heavy work]. They're not
stout enough to do anything heavy [before that]. They're bones are soft yet.
And you don't want to strain them. Some of them takes it awful hard. They
pull too hard. And some of them lays down on you. He wants to go faster
than the rest and he gets mad and he lays down. Then you have to just
whop him up. But you have to be easy with them, of course. The easier you
are, the better you'll come out with them later. You can very soon break
one.
Then sometimes they turn in the yoke. The bow is not exactly right and
°ne will run around this way and leave the other one standing there with
his back end the other way. One's got his head upside down, so one's got
the yoke underneath and the other one's got it on top and then it's an awful
shape. They'll get one killed. You have to go ahead and knock the bow out
and push them around in there and put the bow back. You've got to make
a yoke to fit so they can't do that and so his neck won't turn in the bow.
I've had them to walk on their hind feet—get up in the air ten feet and
jump and rip and tear; but you get them working with other teams in a
procession and they'll soon stop that. That chain goes from one yoke to the
other, and he can't do that.

============================================================

Once you start logging with them, you can teach a pair pretty quick if
you're logging with more than one pair. You put a trained yoke ahead and
then they'll show that [new pair, also called a "yoke"] what to do. The new
ones can't get away 'cause the front [pair] just won't let them run, and
when you hook them [together], the front ones make them go where they
tell them to go.
Now what they call a team is three yokes. Now in the middle you've got
to have a pretty good yoke on account of pulling around a ditch. If they
don't, the front cattle put them down in overboard. They have to be pretty
stout cattle, heavy cattle, to push each other and hold that load up there. A
youngster, he'll go straight through and get in the ditch and get killed. He
don't look out for himself. He don't know how. So the lead ones have to be
perfectly trained, and the middle ones has got to be heavy enough to hold
them in there.
But the butts—the last ones—it don't make no difference whether they're
broke or whether they're not. If they want to pull, they can pull; and if they
don't want to pull, the others'll drag them. They'll go. They'll have to go.
They'll soon learn it; and if they don't look out, the other cattle'll drag
them along. [They'll see that if] the other cattle can do it, they can too.
But the butts should be heavy cattle too because they've got a lot of push-
ing and pulling to do against each other going in through the ditches and
limbs and holes and stuff like that. They have to be stout enough to hold
their own. But the leads have got to be absolutely trained. When you holler,
"Whoa," you want him to stop. It don't make no difference where it is.
And they soon learn it, and they get so they look back and watch to see if
the other cattle is not hung up or anything like that. They buddy up in less
than a week.
Sometimes one of the butts will try to lie down on you. They get mad
and lay down. When they lay down, why, just shoot them one with the ox
whip and let the others pull him up. Then he'll go get mad, and he'll go
on. And don't overload them. Make sure that they can pull it if they want
to. Then after you log them a week or two, why, all the trouble is over. But
don't take two yokes or three yokes of cattle in the rough land like cliffs and
rocks. If you do, you're going to get one killed.
In loading logs—we didn't have no way of loading logs then. We'd just
load them with the cattle. Take the leads off and wrap a chain around the
log and back the wagon up there. Run two chains under the log and on
over and hook the cattle to the ends and let them cattle pull that log up
there. You stand up there with a peavee and watch and see if anything
slips. Then just holler, "Whoa," and they'll hold that log. They won't let it
go back. Then you spike him where you want him and tell them to get up a
little. They'll ease on up there and as quick as the log hits the standards,

A large operation like Champion would also have a commissary where
its men could obtain food, dry goods, tools, feed, and other supplies they might need.
This one, on the head of Sunburst, like other commissaries, had its busiest day on Sat-
urdays when families would be free for the weekend. Since they were only paid every
thirty days, employees would make their purchases with what they called "doogaloo"
—credit vouchers against their forthcoming paychecks. At the end of the month, they
would draw the balance of what was left in their accounts in cash. Such a commissary
might serve as many as twenty camps, the band mill, the general public, and the inde-
pendent loggers, like Millard Buchanan, who cut boundaries of timber themselves,
were paid by the thousand feet of timber they brought in, and could make purchases
here on credit against what the company would owe them at the end of each month.
1 hough most of the people in this photograph undoubtedly work for the company,
only a few of them would be loggers. The list of employees required by a large opera-
tion was staggering, and would include: cooks, "cookies" (cook's assistants), "lobby
nogs' (men who served the food and cleaned the dining hall after meals),
"swampers" (the men who made the skid trails the horses and oxen used to drag the
logs to a loading area), "road monkeys" (men who maintained the skid trails), "grab
jacks"(men who drove grabs into the logs so they could be pulled), teamsters (men
who drove the stock), blacksmiths, stable boys, foremen, timber cutters (the men who
felled the trees and trimmed and cut them to length with crosscut saws and axes), saw-
yers, block setters (men who positioned the logs so they could be sawed at the mill),
firemen to fire the boilers, "off-bearers" (men who took the lumber away from the
saws), "cutoff men" (men who cut the bad ends off lumber and squared it up), "trim-
mers" (men who edged off the bark that the main saws didn't get), "pickup men"
(men who hauled the lumber to the woodyard), "stackers" (men who stacked the
wood in the woodyard), "skidder men" (men who operated the overhead skidders),
flagmen to signal the skidder operators, "tong hookers" (men who hooked the choker
and so they could be dragged to the loading area by the skidder), train engineers,
and so on. (Photo courtesy of Champion Paper.)

they'll automatically stop. They know it's loaded. Then you just turn them
around and get another. You load plumb on up to the top.
Now when I worked in camps, there was some good camps and some bad
camps. One I stayed in had seventy-two men. They come from Hayesville
[North Carolina] and up on Shooting Creek [North Carolina] and several
from Franklin [North Carolina]. There was one horse man that took care
of the horses. Seen that they was, well, fat. He was from West Virginia. He
was a big old feller. Nice, quiet, easy to get along with. He looked after the
horses, and if the harness didn't fit, he'd get out his whittling knife and fix
it. We never lost but one horse. And then the Government had sixteen men
in the woods day and night [marking trees to be cut in the National Forest
lands]. Get out in these mountains and they wouldn't go home. They'd just
get in the barracks and go to sleep and pay the board. Then we didn't do a
thing but hunt the marked trees and cut them.
Now that camp had anything you wanted. Makes no difference what it
was. They had the nicest beds you ever looked at, and they kept clean. And
those beds, they'd go where we'd go. They were in barracks that could be
moved. You could pull them wherever you wanted to. They could move a
whole camp in two hours. And the boys that would go out on a shift hunt-
ing the timber to cut way off, if that company didn't bring the dinner to
them, they'd go and get them and bring them in. But most of the time the
mess sergeant would send the dinner out and meet them at the campground
wherever they were logging.
They had tools and equipment and everything. And the cooks, they had
their barracks connected with the kitchen. Had a dining room, living room,
and kitchen. The living room was a separate building so they didn't inter-
fere with the men and women who cooked. We had both men and women
cooking. It's really a man's job to cook in the woods, but if a woman wants
to do it, why, she's cleanest. I'd rather have a woman cook than a man.
They were handiest.
But all the camps weren't like that. I had to quit one. I left there. They
didn't have brain one. Never thought a man had to sleep at night and had
to have something to eat dinner and supper. They'd just put him on out
and let him go on with it. Tell you what to do and not make no arrange-
ments for you out in the woods. I got full of it.
There was one old head man about seven or eight feet high with a great
big old black moustache—old bony feller. He didn't have brain one. I told
him, "I always work for people that's got a little sense, but now I over-
guessed it so I'm through. Give me my pay and I'll leave."
"Why, you can't do that."
I says, "I'm going to. If you ain't got the money, I'm going to anyhow."
"But what's the matter?"

============================================================

I says, "Nobody's got any brains here to know how to log! That's what's
the matter. Don't you know that a man has to eat a little something once or
twice a day? I come in for supper and you put me on a truck—have to go
to Virginia to get some cables and a compressor and stuff. You never
thought about the bath, and you never thought about the eats. You ain't
got brain one!"
He hung his head a little bit and said, "Well, I thought you had arrange-
ments made."
I says, "Where could I make arrangments in the woods?"
But I never seen such a mess in my life. Man would have to fix him a
place to eat on the table when it did get there. Wasn't no place fixed to set.
You had to get your own stool or a piece of board or something to sit on the
table to eat.
I told him, "When Saturday comes, I'm going home and I'm going to
stay there."
"Oh," he says, "we've got a place for you [to stay]."
"Yes, I see you have. Sleep in the sawdust pile,'by gosh, and lay down in
the shade of a tree [to sleep] when it's hot," I says. "Eat when we find it. If
it ain't fair [weather], why, do without."
"Well," he says, "how did you all do it [in the other camp]?"
I says, "We had a mess hall. We had a cook. We had KP's. We had a
housecleaner. We had a bed fixer to strip the beds." And I said, "If you
want to log, that's the way you got to go at it. You can't work seventy-five
men and have them sleeping on the trees and the bushes and rock cliffs and
get them on the job the next morning."
He looked around a little bit, says, "We can't do without a blacksmith."
I says, "You'll do without me. I'm gone. I'm just the same as home
now."
Looked around there, "I'll have to call headquarters."
I says, "You can call them up and tell them I'm gone."
So I stepped on out.
The kind of camp you ran made a big difference when you expected men
to work hard all day long and into the night.
Jake Waldroop
On July 21, 1976, Jake Waldroop took four of us from Foxfire to see the
"big poplar" in the Nantahala National Forest, not too far from his home
in Cartoogechaye, North Carolina. He has a special interest in this tree,
which is reputed to be the "largest yellow poplar in the United Stales." His
grandfather, also named Jake Waldroop, once owned all the land in Sugar
Cove where the poplar is located and had sold that land to the U. S. Gov-

ernment prior to its being logged. Jake remembers as a child coming to the
big poplar, much larger than any others in the area, with his mother look-
ing for ginseng. It was a landmark even then.
Zeb Waldroop, Jake's father, ran a logging operation in this area about
sixty years ago when Jake was a young man. When the Sugar Cove area
was being cut, Jake had to make a decision about cutting the big poplar
tree. He apparently had no esthetic reasons for saving the tree. Even then it
was at least thirteen feet in diameter and the crosscut saws were only ten
feet long. The logging company said they would get a longer saw. Then
Jake realized that even if the tree were cut, they would have a very difficult
time getting it out of the woods, and then it could not be cut at the sawmill
because of its great width. Therefore the big poplar was spared.
Several years ago a trail was cut through the woods to the tree by the
Forest Service and dedicated to John Wasilik, a former forest ranger well-
liked by the North Carolina residents of this area.
Because his father was a logger and his mother ran a logging camp for
the men he had hired, we asked Jake to tell us about that life.

Oh, Lord, I've logged ever since I was just a boy. I used to help my
daddy log. He had a big operation over in Nantahala with a splash dam
and everything. We've worked back in those coves ten hours a day. In the
wintertime you'd have to take you a lantern to see your way out. Sometimes
he'd have forty or fifty thousand feet of logs loaded on them skids ready to
roll into that slide when they turned that splash dam on. It would take
sometimes a half a day or more before they'd get them all dumped in [the
river]. And then them men, they'd drive them all the way to the mill—ride
the logs down through there. When they'd jam, they'd have to get in there
and break that jam and get them to moving on.
Now when he was doing that splashing and we was down at Tate Cove,
I was a small boy. He always boarded his hands, and my mother run the
boarding house there. All I was big enough to do was carry out the lunch or
dinner. She'd get the dinner ready and we'd carry it up to the Tate Branch
where they was logging. Then they'd come in for supper.
A few of the men boarded at home, but we always had ten or twelve stay
with us. Then they'd go out on Saturday and come back on Sunday evening
and they'd be ready to go to work on Monday morning. On Saturday, if
they was bootleggers around, they'd get a quart or a half-gallon and that
would do them over till they come back in. Never would have much drink-
ing in the camp. They had to do their drinking outside. They'd have their
"drown" on the weekend.
But this camp, my daddy built it and moved us into it. Them that
wanted to go home walked the three or four miles home after work in the
evening after quitting time. Others stayed. We had a big garden. Make our
own potatoes and raise our own corn, and had two or three acres of wheat.
The thrasher would come around at the fall of the year and thrash that
wheat. We'd take it down here at the roller mill and that's all the flour we'd
get. And we'd raise beans. We'd raise the awfullest sight of beans you've
ever seen in your life. I've seen ten, fifteen bushels piled up in a room and
everyone around stringing them. They'd have leather britches beans and
shell beans too, but most of them would be for pickling. They'd pickle a big
barrel full of them. They'd hold sixty to eighty gallons. Fill one of them
with pickled beans, and have big sackfulls of leather britches beans. And
wasn't no trouble about meat. We just grazed hogs back in the mountains. I
remember one time my daddy had twenty-seven killed one day. He got a
bunch of men to come in and killed and dressed and cut up and packed up
twenty-seven. We had a big smokehouse, and we'd salt that meat down in
that smokehouse. So we had the food.
Mother would feed them potatoes, meat, bread. Every morning she
would make them a big pan of sawmill gravy. She'd have a great big skillet
and she'd put some meal or flour in it. You could make it out of corn meal

or flour, but you generally thickened your gravy with flour. She'd put that
flour in that pan and she'd let it brown a little bit. Then she'd dump milk in
there—or water if she didn't have milk. So they'd have gravy, and they'd
have eggs and bacon. A lot of times it would just be the whole big middling.
She'd just slice it up. And ham, and shoulder meat. And she'd have fruit.
We dried sacks after sacks of fruit. And she'd bake these dried fruit pies, or
sometimes just have big platters of that dried fruit on the table. And it was
good, and they'd eat it. And she'd have applesauce and jelly. They'd just
make worlds of jelly up in the fall of the year. Why, you could pick just
bushels of blackberries and apples. She was busy. Worked all the time.
Then either they'd come in for lunch, or they'd send somebody to come
into the boarding house and they'd have the dinner ready all packed in big
buckets and carry it out to the men. And depending on how many men was
going to be at the lunch ground, we'd have a big coffeepot and make it out
there. It was too hard to pack coffee. It generally took two good husky men
to carry out the lunch for them men to eat anyway. They could eat, them
loggers did. Lord goodness, they could take care of some of it. It was a
sight! On a great big platter one would just rake it full of beans and meat
and fruit and vegetables and whatever they had.
It was a good life. I enjoyed it. You didn't have all that much to worry
about. You didn't have all this confusion—killing and everything. Once in
a while one of them would fall out, but hardly ever in them logging camps.
You'd never hear of any trouble much there. Some of these bigger camps,
sometimes some would break over and have a little shooting streak. A man
would get killed over a card game. But not often.
In the evenings, sometimes the men would get out and gang up and play
them a game of setback. I've played setback with them for hours at a time.
It would get so dark we'd have to go in. And 'the gnats would eat us up in
the summertime. We'd have to build up a smoke and we'd set around that
smoke and play setback. And sometimes some of them would bring in a
banjo and make a little music.
And one time we had a fellow—he was the blacksmith. And every
Wednesday night we'd have services—preaching—for the loggers. He'd
wait till after supper and the cookies had gotten everything cleaned up so
thry could listen too. Then George, he would preach in the lobby. Pretty
much every one of them loggers would come in and be just as quiet and lis-
ten to him, you know.
We called them "the good old days." And they was.

I
hope everyone is fortunate enough
to have a special place to go to—a
place they'll always remember. A
place that involves a trek down a tree-covered hill, across the creek, and up
the opposite hill, just for a short visit. A place where you can always smell
something cooking even before you get to the house. And in that place is
the person one will never forget.
I remember Aunt Lola as far back as my memory goes. To me, she hasn't
changed a bit and never will. She has always offered me some cake, pie,
anything sweet, and I have always eagerly accepted. A long time ago, she
gave me a little red Bible on my birthday, and because she gave it to me, it
is a treasured possession.
Aunt Lola is the sort of person you can turn to when things aren't quite
right, when you need advice. She's the person who can tell you right from
wrong without making it sound like a lecture; instead it sounds like good
common sense. There's a kindness about her which is impossible to articu-
late. A very generous and gentle-natured person, I have never heard her say
a harsh word to or about any other person. She's very close to God, and
tries very hard in her own delicate way to help other people know God the
way that she does.
Aunt Lola was born on March 26, 1804 in the Warwoman community,
She's actually my great-aunt, but to me she's been more like a grandmother.
I guess I could sum up all my feelings for Aunt Lola in the three words,
"I love her."

My grandmother said that she could cover my face with an ordinary
coffee cup when I was born. The house that I lived in on Warwoman was a
huge log house. It was wide. I don't know the number of feet, but anyway
the beds sat like that [headboards against the wall] in the back and there
was still plenty of room in between them to go in and out. I can still see it.
It was sealed with wide poplar boards.
[We later moved to Chechero because] we didn't own a good-sized piece
of land. Mother had been raised here on Chechero, and she had never liked
living over there. She was always a little homesick for this place. Daddy got
a chance to buy this property here—all of it. We bought this place which
was Mother's grandfather's property. And we moved into the house where
my sister, Bessie, lives now.
The Godfrey place, as it was called, had the first white settlers in this end
of the community. There was a family, the Coffees, that settled about where
Kingwood [Country Club] is now, and then the Godfrey family was settled
here and it was about three miles across Big Creek to another family. The
cemetery over here has always been called the Godfrey Cemetery.

near the cemetery. Their little girl played under a big oak tree [near the
cemetery]. She had built a playhouse and once, while he was gone back to
buy supplies, she got sick and died. Grandmother bathed and dressed her,
and put her up on a board between chairs and she kept for three days till he
got back. They buried her under that big oak tree. That was the beginning
of that cemetery.
Most of the country was in little settlements. The first man who got up in
the morning would go outside his door and holler just as loud as he could
two or three times to wake the other people. In a little bit, you would hear
from another house over on the ridge somebody had come out and hollered
off his front porch. And it was like that until every family had gotten up
and had their morning hello. I think now if we heard it over the commu-
nity, we would be alarmed. We'd think something was happening. That
was one thing that was always done when I was a child. We didn't have an

those great old big ones. I thought that alarm clock was the most treasured
thing—that you could be waked up any time you wanted to be.
People who keep a mixed flock of chickens [can use roosters as alarm
clocks]. So many people don't keep chickens now. I don't know what it is
about it, but to hear the roosters crow just before dawn brings something
back from my childhood. If you had a rooster in your flock that crowed be-
fore time to get up, you got rid of him. A great many people claimed that
they could tell the time of day by their rooster's crow. Most of the time,
they crowed about half an hour before dawn. You could judge pretty well.
At our house, we used to sing a lot after supper sitting around the fire.
Mother would probably be knitting. Daddy would make axe handles and
hammer handles and different things like that at night. We didn't buy
them. Boys grew up feeling like they had accomplished something when
they learned to make a good axe handle or a good hoe handle. They were
tasks that we could do at night around the fire and there was a lot of good
fellowship in families. There was a habit among people in our area; we'd
get an early supper and go over and visit the neighbors and stay until bed-
time. That was quite an event. If there were children, they got together to
play and the old folks talked and sang. Sometimes two families would get

together and sing. Smaller children would get sleepy quicker and probably
go to bed. And some among the group would stay up as long as the parents
stayed up.
It was a right good time to live then. Now you don't find a lot of fire-
places for families to gather around after supper. And so many people work
at different jobs that take them away from home, that families hardly ever
are all at home at one time. I think we had a closer family relationship in
those days than people do today.
One thing that we enjoyed as youngsters—we always had a Christmas
tree at the church during the Christmas season. Most times it would be a
day or two before Christmas. We'd meet several days before to decorate the
[church] house. We'd cut holly, white pine, and anything that was green,
and decorate each window and each corner of the [church] house. To keep
it from looking bare, we stood greenery up all the way to the ceiling. That
took a day in our lives. But we stretched out a day. Oh, we thought we were
really living it up when we could spend a whole day decorating the church
for Christmas. And then we felt we must go back and clean it up afterward,
and that took another whole day. Oh, we were just as busy as youngsters are
now who work.
My parents didn't talk religion as much as they just worked it in our ev-
eryday living. I wish I could tell you exactly, but somehow you just got up
in the morning and they made you feel like this was another good day if you
used it well, and that's what God wants us to do. They stressed more, I
think, to me about the things that God wants us to do than they did what
you'd call religion. But that is religion, isn't it—what God wants us to do,.
And of course, we went to Sunday school and to preaching service at the
country churches. Back then we had preaching service twice a month.
There would be a Saturday service and a service the following Sunday, and
the other Sundays we had Sunday school. Mother always saw to it, and so
did Daddy, that we had our Sunday school lesson read.
They taught us a lot about God, religion, and our future life in planting
the garden and the fields. Whatever they planted, they expected to get a
harvest from, because they planted it in faith and cultivated it. That was
one of the things that seemed [to leave] more of an impression on my life
than anything else. Now you plant this little, pitiful-looking seed, a grain of
corn, or a bean, or a pumpkin seed, and then think of what a harvest it
would make. And I remember Mama telling me one time that that was the
way your life was. You were just one person and if you did a good deed for
somebody, that made them want to do a good deed for someone else, and it
spreads. That was a valuable lesson to me. Even though you're just one per-
son, you can start a good thing going.

When I was little girl, I was the only child for about ten years and I had
to figure out my own amusement. There weren't any radios or television. I
don't think I'd seen a phonograph till I was about ten years old, so my play
was games my daddy would play with me after supper every night, like Fox
and Geese, and guessing rhymes, and a game we'd play with some object in
the house. One person would say, "I see something that looks like some-
thing else," so then the rest of them would try to guess what it was. Or, I
could say, "I'm looking at something in this room that's green," and every-
body would start guessing. Or I would say, "I see something in this room
that's round," and the person who guessed the most questions won. That
was a great game.
Another pastime at home before I learned to read was dolls. I wanted
more clothes for my dolls and my mother would be busy, so she cut me
some little patterns and I learned to sew. And when I knitted that doll a
sweater, I really thought I had made something.
Once in a while, we had company with a child my age and we made up
a group of little rag dolls and took them down to the creek. We baptized
them and we sang songs that they sing at church, and then later we had a
hospital. We knew nothing about a hospital except what we'd read. There
wasn't one in the county then. So we had the hospital and some of our pa-
tients would die and we had a burying ground for them, and the next time
these girls were there, we'd go dig up the dolls and see if they were still
dead.
There were no bought toys in my home. Of course, people near town had
more of those things, but we made our toys. I made lots of corncob dolls
and dressed them up like people. We made corn-silk hair for them. We
learned to improvise. I guess it stood us in good stead. It was really good for
us, and especially when the Depression hit. We had to improvise so many of
our things, so early training of making toys was good for us.
We girls would build elaborate playhouses, and work so hard our mothers
would wonder, "How did you get so dirty?" Usually we looked for a
thicket, a laurel thicket was the nicest place to build because the little trees
made the partitions for the walls. We roamed the country looking for pretty
rocks and mosses to furnish our houses. And our bathtub was a whole heap
of pine needles piled up and shaped out for a bathtub. We'd take pieces of
lace or something from home to make the pillow shams and table covers.
At school, sometimes the boys and girls played together in a game they
called "Tap me." [The children made] a ring and one was left to tap one of
the others. He'd run around the ring a time or two to draw the others' at-
tention; then tap someone and run. The one he tapped, to catch him, had
to go around the circle again. That's about the only games boys and girls
played together. Now some of the larger girls liked to play ball and were

============================================================
PAGE 320
============================================================

AUNT LOLA CANNON 
323
good ball players. The boys liked to have them join because they were good.
The smaller girls and boys wouldn't play ball too much. They were apt to
get in the way and get hurt.
I went to school at Warwoman my first years in school, in one of those
little weatherboard, one-room schoolhouses. All the children were in that
one room. I think the most pupils that were usually in school were thirty,
and you know it kept the teacher pretty busy. We went to school from eight
until four, but we had an hour recess at dinner time and a short break in
the morning and afternoon, about fifteen minutes. It gave us time to go to
the spring and get water. There were no buses. We all walked to school.
In those days, there would be one time along in the autumn when a trav-
eling photographer would come through the county and make the students'
group picture. I had a couple, one made at Warwoman and one made here
[at Chechero]. I don't know what became of those pictures. I would have
treasured them a lot now. I didn't think so much about them then.
Our school days were really fun. We had only five months of school. It
was out early in the fall. Later on, we got to having a seven-month school.
And I went to school a couple of years after they started having nine
months of school. Schools weren't graded when I went. I finished what I
guess was the seventh grade. They started the grading process about the
time I was in the last year of school. If you had applied yourself, you had a
pretty good basic education when you finished the seventh grade.
I had a very eventful school life. I enjoyed it. I don't think my mother
ever had to drive me off with a switch. Some children didn't like school;
but I liked it even though I wasn't such a good student. I just liked the
companionship.
My education was pretty limited, and as my children went a little way in
school I helped them with their homework and pretty soon had to do a little
studying in the daytime to keep up. I thought at that time, when my chil-
dren are all on their own and I have no responsibility, I'll go back to school.
I didn't think at that time that I wouldn't have a retentive mind and
wouldn't be able to go back to school. I tried to keep reading when I could.
1 tried to use the best language for [my children] and I studied a little
harder to express myself better.
We had lots of fun in those days. The farmers would gather up their corn
in the fall. There was always a [corn] crib, most times it was a log crib, a
log building that would have a big shed alongside it to protect the corn.
They'd pile the corn up there. One farmer would invite everybody to a corn
shucking on a certain day. That was quite a treat—to go see a lot of young
People and a lot of older people. We shucked the corn. I don't think I was
ever at a corn shucking where they had the jug of moonshine hid in it.
They did at some places. The person who shucked to that jug first was the

top of the evening. We had such dinners, such big dinners, cooked—all
cooked on a wood stove or in the fireplace. A lot was done by the fireplace.
The stove wouldn't hold all the pots and pans. We had a fabulous dinner.
We'd have big kettles of pork, turnips and turnip greens, cabbage, potatoes,
and beans. There wasn't much canned stuff then. In fact, I can just remem-
ber the fruit jars that Mama bought and they were such a novelty. All of the
good things that you can think of to eat—big platters of baked sweet po-
tatoes, butter, buttermilk. I don't believe we had much cake served at
dinners like that, but there would be countless stacks of dried apple pies,
"half moons" they called them. Roll out a real flat surface of dough and cut
it out by a plate. Spread the fruit on half of it and turn the other half over
it. Seal it together by mashing the edges with a fork. Oh, my, they were
good.
Families did lots of things together like that. There was a lot of land that
had virgin timber which had to be cleared if you wanted to make some
more farm land. Some farmers would have their trees marked and how they
wanted them to fall, and what they wanted done with them. They cut the
big logs into something to build with and burned the brush and got the land
all ready for planting. [We'd have a log rolling then.]
The girls had quiltings. They'd put up a quilt on the frames that hung
from the ceiling. The girls and women would quilt, and then at night they'd
have a party. Some fellow in the community that played the banjo, and
maybe a French harp, would gather in and we'd all have a party. Some-
times it lasted until after midnight. I wonder how many of the young peo-
ple today could work all day and then dance until that time. But we had
wonderful times and when I tell my grandchildren about it, they look at me
wide-eyed like they thought, "Well, Granny, isn't that tale a little too thin?"
Washing was done usually at a creek near the house. The people
searched out a spot that would be near a good spring or a good creek, and
built their house there. We usually washed at the creek with a big iron pot
to boil the clothes in. The men searched the woods for hollow logs and
would saw them off in six-foot lengths or more, then hollow them on out into
a smooth hard surface and put a bottom on and that was your tub for
scrubbing.
There are a lot of the old habits when I grew up that I still like to sit and
think about. So many of them were really good habits. Young people
learned to work, of course. I expect the young people learn to work as
quickly now as they did then, but it was a different type of work. It was all
rural and there was no going to town except on Friday or Saturday to buy
the necessary things. We grew most of them at home. The children were all
taught little tasks. We had chickens, and they were to be fed and looked
after. Then there were always cows and calves. Cows had to be taken to one

pasture and the calves to another. Many little tasks to be done. The wood
stoves were all that we had up until some years ago. They required a lot of
Petting with wood. You'd have to get wood for them so you'd have a good
fire.
It was right amusing. There were lots of little things that brought a laugh
in those days. Nobody got their feelings hurt. If somebody made some mis-
take or did something not just right, why everybody just laughed it off.
Today, you all know how it is when the boys reach a dating age, or before.
They've just got to have a car. They just must have it. Well, back in those
days when a boy reached that age, they just had to have a horse or a mule.
It was the same way it is with cars now to what kind you could afford. But

============================================================

they worked terribly hard then to get them a buggy. And if they were pretty
well-to-do, they'd have a top on it. That was still a little higher up. Every
fellow had his buggy and kept it just as clean and cared for as the boys do
their cars today. And the harness for the mules or horses was all shined up
and nice for Sunday. I guess the poor old horses had a harder day on Sun-
day than they did the rest of the week. We really had a time then.
Mothers at that time thought you must know how to card and spin, how
to cook, how to quilt, and you must know how to keep your house neat and
clean. You must behave in mixed company very quietly, and you were
never to be isolated with any man. There must be a group of you. I expect
a great many girls grew up [with] a kind of fear that they didn't know how
to go out to meet the world. Each girl was taught how to save the field seeds
and the garden seeds, and when the best time for planting was. One thing
went in one time and another at another time. The older people used the
signs of the zodiac much more than they do now. My mother wouldn't have
planted a bean at any other time than the arms [see The Foxfire Book, page
212]. My father had a time when he planted potatoes. He would have
missed a crop rather than plant at a different time.
The boys were taught early how to chop properly and carefully, they
were taught methods of planting, and when to plant such and such, and if
the father had a carpenter trade or other trade, they taught their sons that.
Most communities had at least one or two basketmakers. A lot of the boys
liked to go to this basketmaker's place and take lessons from him. That way
they learned to do the work, not only baskets, but chair seating and making
stools. Very few boys learned how to cook. They didn't teach boys as much
back then about housework. They were taught about cattle and how to no-
tice for signs of the mating season for the cows and the horses. When a
young man grew to where he could plow a straight furrow across a good-
sized field, he was very proud. He considered himself a man. The boys were
taught what types of firewood was best in the days when we all made soap
from the wood ashes. Most mothers liked hickory or oak for their ashes to
make soap. The boys were taught how to fell the trees, and how to make
them into whatever type of wood they needed. No two fireplaces were ex-
actly the same length. They had to know how to gauge their wood. And
you most always saw a little boy with a roll of hickory bark in his pocket.
That was a string then. You wet that little hickory bark. You take it from a
little tree and peel it off in tiny little sections, some you could take down to
just a fraction. Little boys traded their hickory bark rolls sometimes. Some-
times one fellow didn't have any, but maybe he had some marbles that an-
other fellow wanted. They traded like that. That was their wampum, really.
As each girl grew up and began to get to the dating age, she liked to
piece quilts. Girls pieced their quilts and had them all ready [for their own

============================================================

homes]. They had their sheets and pillowcases ready. We knew nothing then
in our part of the world about seamless sheets. You bought sheeting. It was
in several grades, thirty-eight or maybe forty inches wide, and you sewed
two lengths together to make your sheets. That's the way we made our
sheets and pillowcases. Most of us learned to crochet or embroider to trim
those pillowcases. We took pride in having all the bedding ready that we
would need. And usually the groom's mother gave him a set of bedding,
too, I think.
I married Raleigh in 1917, and we went to housekeeping in that little
twenty-four by sixteen-foot schoolhouse. We didn't have a great deal, but
we got it all in that house and we lived in it, like that, until a year later.
When I went to housekeeping, I had made four quilts, and I had some
more started. I had six sheets and that was many more than lots of the girls
had. A lot of them just had two. I thought that I had really set myself up
when I had six sheets. When I went to housekeeping, a lady that my hus-
band worked for (she spent her summers up here) gave him two big old
porchlike rockers. I had a bedstead and he bought a bedstead. Two was all
we had room for in that little house, along with those two rockers. He had
made a round dining table from walnut, which was my treasure. I had a
clothes press that my daddy had made me, a big trunk, and a tiny little
number-eight cook stove. How we got all those things in that little house, I
don't know, but we did.
We didn't have all the cookware and things that people have today. I
had bought a set of blue enamel ware. There was a water bucket, a preserv-
ing kettle, a big spoon, and two little boilers. Then I had a few dishes that
my grandmother gave me. But I didn't want to use those—they were for
best. It was very plain ware that we had those days. Now the more wealthy
people did have china and nicer things.
Raleigh built a porch across one end and along one side of the little
house. I was so happy over that porch. One end of it was sunny in the
morning and the other end was sunny in the afternoon which was very nice
when the children began to come along. He put up a sort of banister
around and we let them play out there.
The first year we kept house, my husband bought a pig. We raised it as a
Pet. We didn't keep the door shut so she came into the house. Anywhere we
found her outside, we'd call her and she'd lie down for you to scratch her.
We spent hours teasing that pig. And when she got big enough to have baby
pigs, my husband gave me one of my own. I raised it and sold it. With the
money from that, I bought some Alaska silverware (I think that's what
they called it), a set of knives and forks.
1 don't remember when we first got electricity. The line came out to the
Methodist church. Then it was some little time till it came on out as far as

Mrs. Pollard's. And we all got impatient about it down here in Chechero.
They kept promising, "As soon as we can, it'll be out there." One day my
sister and I stopped in and talked to the power company people and told
them that if we didn't hurry up and get electricity down in our section of
the country, there were going to be a lot of divorces.
One man in there said, "Well, how's electricity going to help?"
I said, "The men are getting tired of wearing shirts that have been ironed
with a flat iron by a wood stove, and they're going to divorce us if we cant
find something better."
I think that must have been my happiest time of life. I didn't actually re-
alize the responsibility of raising a family, so I didn't have that to worry-
about. I could just enjoy my children. Raleigh always made plenty for them
to eat so I didn't have the food to worry about—just to make their clothes.
I knitted their bootees, socks, sweaters, and caps. I said if they ever got large
enough that I didn't have to knit for them, I would never touch another
knitting needle, but I have taken it up again. It required a lot of fore-
thought and planning to be able to have what they needed for school.
I did housework before I was married. When Luther Rickman was
sheriff, I worked with his wife for three or four years. Then I worked in a
little cafe for an old German lady. When the WPA came in, I worked in a
school lunchroom and that's the only out-of-home work I've done. I en-
joyed it, but we didn't have many conveniences. The patrons brought in
firewood for the wood stoves in the lunchroom. I had to do it a lot of times.
Sometimes in the winter, the pump would be frozen and we'd have to carry
water from a spring a far piece off. It was hard but I liked it. However, I
would rather work at home. Yes, there are so many little intimate things
you can do in the home. For years my husband wasn't able to do much but
just sit around. He liked someone around, and I didn't get to do as much
housework as I would have liked to. There was one thing 1 had always
hoped to do and prayed to do—to take care of my husband as long as he
was living. I had that privilege until he had a stroke and I couldn't manage
him and he had to go to the hospital. I got a lot of satisfaction knowing I
did everything I could for him and I could supply all his material needs and
read to him and pray with him. Since he's been gone, I just can't pin myself
down to anything. I start something and don't get it done, but however
many tasks the Lord wants me to do, He'll give me the ability and time to
do them in.
I have done a lot of things, but the most satisfying was a good productive
garden. I got such a thrill out of putting up fruits during the fall before the
freezer was introduced. I found a lot of pleasure in making a quilt just like
I wanted to. Maybe I would put it in the frame you see hanging from the

ceiling. And when I finished, I had so much pride in it. I don't quilt now
because I can't see well enough.
If I learned how to bake a different cake and it turned out well, I loved
that. Just about everything I did, if I had done it well, I thought I really-
had accomplished something.
And I liked working outdoors. A great many women helped to do the
outdoor work. Most of them in my environment helped saw wood or chop
wood and do any of the outdoor tasks with the men. A great many mothers
were wise enough to teach their sons to help in the house, too. Women in
those days did a lot of work in fields alongside their men if there weren't a
lot of small children. If there were small children, they'd take a quilt, a bot-
tle of milk, and maybe a piece of bread to the field and find a shade to put
the pallet down in, and then sit the baby on it while they worked. Women
did more outdoor work then. People worked in those days from early to
late; it wasn't from eight to four. People considered themselves quite indus-
trious if they got to the fields before sun-up and worked till sundown. I
don't see how they did it. And we couldn't now because it seems like we've
gotten out of that way of doing.
I have six children, five girls and one boy. They learned to do all sorts of
work. All of them but one can milk a cow better than I can now. Of course,
they don't have to do it now. They finished grammar school here on
Chechero, and then they went to work. Ruth and Estelle worked during the
summer for some of the boarding houses. There was nothing for girls to do
PLATE 297 Aunt Lola's barn.

then as they can now. [After finishing grammar school], they went away to
Tallulah Falls [for high school], all five of the girls, to board there.
I wouldn't know how to cope with youngsters today. I certainly
wouldn't. I think that I would rather have raised my family back in those
days than today. I think it was easier to impress them with worthwhile
things of life, because there weren't so many distracting things. I'm sure that
I couldn't cope with training youngsters today. They are given so much
more permission when they're little fellows, and then when they get larger,
I'm at a loss on how to handle them. My children weren't the best brought
up children in the world by any means, but they did learn that "no" was
"no" and that it didn't do any good to whine and pout and cry like I see
some do today. I think that saved me a lot of worry later and was better for
them.
I used to go to bed and cry when I made the children do things that were
too hard for them. But today they tell me that it influenced their later lives.
Today, it seems like people are a little too permissive with their children.
While they are small, that's the time to get in your best training, before they
start to school. What they learned from their parents then really influences
their lives. It's just as easy to teach them good manners and good language
as it is to teach them bad language and bad manners. It's the early training
in the early years that really counts.
One of my neighbors taught school. She said that when she had class
every morning, she could tell which child had had discipline at home.
When they were given their books, she could tell a child that had been read
to and that had grown up with the influence of pictures and books. She said
it was very easy to pick out that child. It goes to prove that the early part of
their life is [the best time to train a child].
We tried to give our children good training at home and a good religious
background. We had an event in churches then that I don't see so much
now, Children's Day. The churches almost every year had a Children's
Day, sometime in May or June. The children would practice for weeks, and
they'd go to church and their teacher or instructor would meet them there
once or twice a week. They would practice their recitation, the songs and
the plays that they'd use. We'd go a day maybe beforehand, and clean up
the church and decorate it with whatever was available. That was a great
event for us. People came from miles and miles to the church for our Chil-
dren's Day. The smaller child who could memorize some little thing would
get up and speak his piece. Why, it helped their ego a lot.
When we went to church, we went in when we got there and sat down.
Our children didn't run around the churchyard laughing and playing and
making noise. They went into the church very reverently and then when the
singing would begin, the little fellows tried to sing. All they did was kind of

============================================================
PAGE 328

AUNT LOLA CANNON 
331
crow around but at least they made their noise. And between the Sunday
school service and the church service, we had what was called an intermis-
sion, a little time to get out and walk about and maybe go get a drink of
water. They always looked for a place to build a church near a cool spring
so they could get water. Then they gathered back in the church and had
song service and then a preaching service.
My children had a better advantage than I did, church-wise. I was able
to go with them every Sunday, and for the most part, we had two preaching
services a month. They had more chances to learn, and back in those days
religion was taught in the school a lot. Most of the teachers either had the
group of children stand up, and they grouped around and sang one or two
hymns each morning and had the "Lord's Prayer." I think that's mostly
been abandoned lately. But that was quite good and more than once, we've
had teachers, since my children were going to school, who didn't rely on the
"Lord's Prayer," but prayed a little personal prayer. I understand that a lot
of children don't hear the Lord's name mentioned except profanely at
school now. I'm sorry that [the prayer and hymns] were done away with.
There wouldn't have to be any denomination talk. It could be just basic
religion, belief in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Being a Christian is important to me. I have a friend up the road who
owns a little apple stand. I taught him when he was in Sunday school; he
was thirteen or fourteen, at the age when boys are apt to be noisy. This
group of boys and girls were unusually good children, I thought. I just
loved them everyone. And when they grew up, some of them went to service
and some didn't come back. But this boy came back and he had some
nerve-racking experiences and it left him in a nervous state. He went into
business and after awhile, it didn't succeed. He married and his marriage
broke up; then his mind seemed to go haywire all together and he was in a
mental hospital for quite a bit. I got his address from one of his brothers
and wrote to him. I sent him a copy of the Clayton Tribune and he wrote
back and told me how much he enjoyed it. We sent him the Tribune as
long as he stayed. Now when I meet him, he almost always mentions that.
If anybody from this community stops by to buy anything from him, he
gives them a bag of apples to send to me. And I feel that it is bread on the
water.
I'll tell you another one. Women didn't have a lot to say about politics
then. They may have influenced their family some, but they never got out
and took any part in it. After they had the vote, you could begin to see a
pickup in their attitude. I was old enough to vote when women got the
vote, but I didn't vote for a few years after it was permissible. I didn't real-
ize that, even though I was not too well posted on things, my vote might do
as well as anybody else's. The first few times I went to the voting place

(then most every little county had a voting spot, or a law ground and a law
house), I felt a little bit out of place. I'd never been used to voting. But now
I think nothing about it because everybody does.
I remember the first time I went to the election. One of the managers
said, "Well now, Aunt Lola, I want you to vote the right way today."
I said, "Will you tell me how I must vote to vote the right way?"
And he began to tell me who to vote for. And I said, "I'd already made
up my mind before I came out here. I had talked to a person that gave me
an idea how to vote."
He said, "Who was that?"
And I said, "The Lord."
That man wilted like you had poured hot water over him. He didn't say
anymore to me about it!
That faith is one thing that really stands out about Aunt Lola. As she
said at one point in the interview, "If Cod should call me tomorrow, I've
had so many good things happen in my life, I'd be ready."

After the article about her appeared in our magazine, Anita received a
letter from Aunt Lola which she shared with us. It said in part, "The maga-
zines came today. They had followed me back to my mountains. I was so
happy when I read your note at the beginning, for I had never dreamed
when I used to wonder 'if I would see little heads bobbing across the field
this day,' that it meant anything more to you than just a little trip outside
your own playground. If it meant something to you, I am very glad; it was
a bright spot in my day.
"It is still a lovely thing to remember all of you growing up into such in-
dustrious, helpful women; people who can help the world to be a better
place for those who follow after us. My love and prayers will always be
yours."

WATER SYSTEMS
T
.he selection of a site for a new
farm was always based, in part,
on the availability of a good
supply of clean, cold water. "I've got a good, bold spring," is a sentence we
have heard hundreds of times, and it is always said with pride and satis-
faction.
The methods used for tapping that water are bewilderingly varied. At
one end of the spectrum is the system that is so simple that all that is
required to make it work is a bucket and a pair of hands to carry it. This is
the system that nearly all the earliest families used, and it is still used by
people like Hillard Green. A spring is located. Often the basin is enlarged,
deepened, and lined with rock—not cemented, of course, so that water can
come into the basin not only from the bottom but also through the sides—
and this causes a small pool to form from which water can be dipped, or
into which containers can be set to keep their contents cold. The top of the
basin on the side out of which the overflow runs is kept level with the origi-
nal stream bed so as not to interfere with the water's natural flow.
One thing that has always confused us somewhat is why, at the vast ma-
jority of abandoned, original log home places we have explored, the house
was set some distance above the spring on a hillside or on top of a knoll
when it could just as easily have been set closer to the spring. Most of the
people we've asked don't know, but the ones that venture a guess say that
since the spring is often in low ground, building a house there would pre-
vent the occupants from being able to look out over their land and fields
and keep their eye on things. Being up higher let them watch to see if deer
had gotten into their corn crop, or if visitors were coming up the road, and
so on.
Whatever the reason, there were some disadvantages to this system.
Water had to be lugged uphill (there were no pumps), and there was al-
ways the danger that the spring could become contaminated by sewage
from the barn and/or outhouse above unless a good distance separated
them.

Gradually, some families moved away from this system toward others.
Aunt Arie, for example, finally got so irritated at the fact that the water
from her spring was always full of tiny, flashing specks of isinglass (mica)
that she made her husband dig a well beside the house. Then they set their
springhouse over the old water system (see section on springhouses). Other
families must have tired of finding leaves and dead animals in their un-
covered springs. Some built up the walls of the rock basin so they were flush
around the top, with an exit hole in the lower side for the overflow, and
fashioned a removable wooden lid. Others began to look for other, better
ways.
We guess that the one event that changed the means of getting water
most dramatically was the eventual availability of pipe. Making wooden
water pipes (see section on same) had always been possible, but when stores
began to stock cheap metal pipe, suddenly everyone was talking about
"gravity water." What this involved was finding a new spring—this one
above the house—and piping some of its water down the hillside to the
house, letting gravity do all the work.
One of the earliest systems of this sort that we have seen was built as fol-
lows: a covered collection basin of the type we've already mentioned was
built around the spring to keep out animals, leaves, and surface water. The
exit hole was plugged except for a pipe. A second exit hole slightly above
the first allowed any overflow to escape easily and take its natural course
down the original stream bed. The pipe led from the spring directly down
to a sink in the house itself. There was no faucet. The pipe simply ran
twenty-four hours a day into the sink. The biggest problem this kind of sys-
tem created is one that Charlie Ross Hartley talks about in another section
in this chapter: what to do with the overflow. In this case, a pipe carried
the overflow out the bottom of the sink, into an open fifty-gallon wooden
trough near the barn so the stock could be watered, and from there to a
nearby stream where it was set loose again. In the case of Oma Ledford's
combination springhouse/water supply (see section on springhouses), the
overflow went directly from the end of her indoor trough into a stream
behind her house.
Later, as more and more demands were put on the system by the addi-
tion of such things as flush indoor toilets, bathtubs, and hot water heaters,
another major alteration was made. Faucets and valves were installed so
that the water only ran when a valve was opened. The rest of the time it
sat, unmoving, in the pipe. This necessitated two things: first, the pipe had
to be buried to keep the water inside it from freezing in the winter; and sec-
ond, a reservoir had to be installed somewhere along the line above the
house, for any major demands put on the old system drained the line almost
immediately and reduced the flow of water to a trickle. Early reservoirs were

simply fifty-gallon wooden barrels. The water ran in at the top, filled the
barrel, and overflowed from the top either into the original stream or into a
channel that led to that stream. The pipe leading to the house exited from
the barrel at a point some six or eight inches above its bottom so that any
sediment that collected in the barrel over time would not get sucked into the
line. Later reservoirs were more elaborate. Two or three barrels might be
hooked together, for example.
Today, many people use large, precast concrete tanks made for use as
septic tanks but acquired for this purpose instead. Round sections of cement
culverts, or tiles for lining wells do equally well when set on end and sealed
at the bottom with six inches of cement.
Some experiments failed, of course. Noel Moore's first attempt at a reser-
voir was doomed. Noel built it with cement blocks, but neglected to fill the
holes in the blocks with cement. Water seeped in and, during the first win-
ter, froze, expanded, and broke the sides open. Some people still use cement
blocks, but they fill the center holes, plaster the inside walls with three

inches of plaster, and often coat that lining with a waterproofing compound
that will prevent water from being absorbed into the walls and freezing dur-
ing cold spells.
Today, gravity systems are still popular in the mountains, but those who
want to build one are urged to go to the office of the local health depart-
ment official and pick up a free set of guidelines. These guidelines recom-
mend a system that is completely sealed from spring to house so that at no
point along the line can the water become contaminated by such things as
animal feces, chemical fallout from the air, or surface water from a neigh-
bor's hog lot.
At one point, that may not have been such an important consideration,
but now, with more and more houses being built closer and closer together,
and the risk of contamination more serious than ever before, the guidelines
serve an important purpose—insuring that water that is not treated chemi-
cally remains as pure as possible until it's used.
WOODEN WATER PIPES
When the first settlers came into the mountains, there were no stores
where they could buy metal pipes for their plumbing: They had to carry
their water in buckets from the spring to their cabin or barn.

As time went on, they found that they could split logs in half lengthwise
and hollow them out to make water troughs above ground so the water
could flow to the springhouse.
Later they found a way to make a tool to make wooden pipes out of
green poplar or yellow pine. This tool is an auger. Some are larger than
others, hut they all have the same purpose: to bore out the center of the
logs. After fitting the logs together (sec Plate 313), they buried them under-

ground in a pipeline that would bring the water straight to the spigot that
was made out of poplar, and then to the springhouse (see Plate 316). They
found that these underground lines would last fifty or sixty years.
For a long time we looked for someone who could show us how to make
these pipes. Finally we found Garnett Lovell who came from a family of
blacksmiths. His father, George Lovell, sharpened the steel for the tools
used to make Rabun County's Lake Burton Dam. Both his father and
grandfather, Elijah Lovell, had made these water pipes. In fact, Elijah had
made the auger that Garnett still has. Garnett agreed to show us exactly the
way it was done if we would bring a six-inch diameter, ten-foot long pine
log. We brought him the log and he showed us how the pipes were made.

SPRINGHOUSES
Long ago before electricity was brought to the mountains, people were
faced with the age-old problem of preserving their food. They came up with
many methods for doing this. Meats were dried or salted and smoked. Veg-
etables and fruits were either dried or pickled in brine or canned. There was
still the problem, however, of keeping things cool during the warm-weather
months. Milk, cheese, and butter had to be kept cool, and many people pre-
ferred to keep their pickled and canned foods cool also. They solved the
problem by building springhouses.
Springhouses are buildings that are constructed over or near springs.
Cold water runs through them to serve the same function as a present-day
refrigerator. This section is about springhouses, their design, their uses, and
their advantages and disadvantages.
There is an abundance of fresh springs, rocks, and lumber in the moun-
tains, so these were the primary materials used, but we discovered that all
springhouses are not alike. We researched four springhouses. Two were con-
structed entirely of rock, one was made from wood, and the fourth was built
of both wood and rock.
Wooden springhouses were constructed faster and with less effort than
rock springhouses, but wood buildings were more vulnerable to the weather
and did not last as long as rock ones. We found that the deciding factors
which determined the materials to be used were the availability of either
rock or wood and the amount of time available to build one. Rock buildings
require more skill and time to construct. We know of one man who used
pieces of old T-model Fords to serve as a framework for the rocks to speed
up the construction process.
In the next few pages we'll present the floor plans of each springhouse,
the people who remember its construction, and any small details that make
each one unique. The springhouses that we documented were Aunt Arie
Carpenter's in Coweeta, North Carolina, Harry Brown's, Mrs. Oma Led-
lord's, and Mrs. Jay Hambidge's, all located near Dillard, Georgia. The in-
formation given in this article was taken from interviews with Aunt Arie
and Harry Brown.
We hope the following diagrams and photographs are easy to understand,
and through reading this you might further understand and appreciate
the ingenuity that mountain people displayed while overcoming one more
obstacle that they were faced with in their daily lives.

Harry Brown's
In Harry Brown"s yard is a rock structure half-buried in the ground. The
entire building is made of rocks and cement and is covered with ground ivy.
At first glance one might think it is just a mound of dirt, or even a bomb
shelter, but closer inspection reveals a cleverly built springhouse.
In the summer of 1932 Harry Brown started work on the springhouse.
"First I built the form out of culled lumber. Then I'd throw down a shovel
of cement, and throw me a rock in it. Throw me another shovelful or two
and throw more rocks down in it. I didn't try to keep the outside smooth."
When Harry built the walls up to the desired height, he took "the frames
and axles from two T-model Fords and laid them on top. Then I started
dumping cement by th'wheelbarrow load and then threw rocks on it. I did
most of it by myself. I worked on it about three months. I'd set rock a few
days, then rest a few days, then set more rock. It's like when you build a
chimney, you haul what rocks you need, then you get that many more, then
you get a few more t'finish up and you might have enough rock. It was that
way here."
We asked Harry if he likes a refrigerator more than his springhouse. He
favored the springhouse. "You can keep things in here [the springhouse] for
about five days. We've put our milk in here, and gone off and visited three
or four days and come back, and the milk would still be sweet."
Harry mentioned another advantage: "If you keep your stuff sealed up
in a frigidaire and you put fish or something like that in there, everything
you've got will taste like fish. But in a springhouse, you see, the air's not
compact and that don't happen. And the temperature wouldn't vary ten
degrees."
In the top of the springhouse is an air vent that measures about ten by
twelve inches. "That gives it air. See, if I had it closed up in here, it would
be like a refrigerator. It would condense and begin to get thick. You'd have
dead air in here like in the refrigerator. You ain't got much space in a re-
frigerator and the same old air stagnates, while in here in the springhouse, it
circulates. And if it weren't for that vent, there'd be water dripping in here
all day."
In addition to the vent, the springhouse also has a window for light, an
entrance door, and an inner door. The inner door is used to keep the dogs
out. "If they's anything t'eat, a dog'll get ahold of it."

============================================================

Before the Browns had electricity, Harry kept his springhouse full. "We
kept our milk and our butter, and anything you put in your refrigerator,
like your beans and your meat, and even if you got more fish than you can
eat. You can even put them in there. You use it for nearly anything that
you use a refrigerator for."
Harry said his springhouse was good all year round. The water never
froze in the winter because it was from a deep spring, and it was always
cool in the summer for the same reason.
The springhouse is practically the same today as it was when it was built
in 1932. The shelves for storing canned goods have rotted out, but it is still
used when the power fails or if the refrigerator in the house is full.

Oma Ledford's
With the help of Mr. L. D. Hopper, R. H. Ledford built the Ledford
springhouse around 1937—38. It was built onto the house out of lumber Mr.
Ledford sawed at his own sawmill.
The trough in the springhouse was fourteen inches wide and seven feet,
two inches long. The water fell about three feet from the pipe into the
trough and drained out through a small hole in the end of the trough which
was outside the springhouse.
There were also some shelves in the springhouse on which canned fruits
and vegetables were stored.

Aunt Arie Carpenter's
On Aunt Arie's little farm, a springhouse that was built by her hus-
band, Ulysses, sits just below her house. The springhouse has a rock floor.
The lower half of the back wall is built below ground level and is also made
of rock. The four walls and door are made from rough-cut lumber, and the
roof is covered with wooden shingles.
When we asked Aunt Arie whether she preferred a refrigerator or a
springhouse, she quickly replied, "I wouldn't trade one frigidaire for a
thousand springhouses." She stated that you can get your milk and butter
and not have to worry whether it was raining or not. Aunt Arie also said
that it saved many unnecessary steps. "I wish 1 had a dollar for every trip I
made to that there springhouse. If they was silver dollars, I wouldn't be
able to lift'em."
Aunt Arie's springhouse features a simple rectangular design with a single
channel of water flowing on one side which is "just wide enough t'put a
churn in."
Even though the springhouse hasn't been used for several years, it is still
standing and in good shape. The roof needs a little repair and weeds have
grown up around it, but with a little work this springhouse could be con-
verted to function as it once did.

The Jay Hambidge Art Foundation's
The Hambidge springhouse was built around 1918-19. It was used to
keep the milk and butter cold for the Hambidge Center. Canned fruits and
vegetables were also kept cool on shelves in the innermost part of the
springhouse. In 1939 the springhouse was replaced by electric means for
cooling.
The springhouse was built completely of stone and has two main rooms.
The outermost is not completely enclosed and contains a holding trough for
the water to run in before entering the springhouse. Also there is a
springhead next to the holding trough. This is where people used to get
water for household needs.
The other room is the largest and was completely enclosed so no animals
could get in. It has one door and a vent in the top for air circulation. The
water entered the springhouse from the holding trough through a four-
inch pipe and emptied into the troughs in which the milk and butter were
put. The troughs were eighteen inches wide and had steps which kept the
water moving and provided different levels of water. The water followed
the "L"-shaped trough and drained out through a four-inch outlet at the
back of the springhouse.

DOWSING FOR WATER
After several months of searching for a well dowser who would talk to us,
we finally found one. There are not too many traditional dowsers around
our section anymore, so we were fortunate to meet C. M. Arrowood who
had a reputation for finding water with a probing rod and a "V"-shaped
stick. He talked quite freely with us, and even came to the school to demon-
strate his skill to our class by finding all the school's main water lines.
As everyone expressed amazement at the "V" stick which bent forcefully
to the left or right each time Mr. Arrowood crossed a water source, he said,
"I don't know how it's done, but I can do it. Back before you kids was
born, I had a good job, but I lost it. So I built me a log house myself, and
since I wasn't able [financially] to have a well dug, I went to see a man
who knowed how to dowse and he found where the water was so I could
dig the well myself. Well, I forgot where he marked the ground. So I got
me a stick and retraced where he'd been and found it myself. I dug seven-
teen feet on Christmas day and hit water. Well, when I got down to the
water, my father-in-law come and said his well was muddy, so I had dug
right into his stream. I been doing this since—about fifty-five years."
When asked how he could be sure the stick was working, Mr. Arrowood
replied, "When I have it in my teeth and on my thumb, I can't control it. It
has to be free. The pressure would break this stick [when water is present] if
I held it tight. About the only way to tell how much water is down there is
by the stronger the pressure or pull."
We wondered if it mattered what kind of stick to use. Mr. Arrowood
didn't think it did, as long as it was green and pliable. "I never go hunt one
stick in particular. The stick is easier handled, though, if it is forked—in a
"V" shape."
He also puts a knife, open, in the straight part of the stick. When asked
why, he said, "I was just taught to use the knife. It'll work without it, but it
works better with it. It moves easier."
Then he added, "I don't ever charge anything for this. Oh, if the people
are satisfied with the well [after it's finished], they might give me ten or
fifteen dollars, and I turn around and give it to the church. I don't do this
as a way to make money for myself.
"They is water all under the earth, but you can't afford to dig here when
the water is over yonder. You've got to pinpoint it [to save time and
money]. I just find the water and tell them to dig. I've found hundreds of
them. Missed one. They drilled for it. Might have missed it six inches. I've
also hit in other counties where it Ls not as damp as here in Rabun County.
I got my first well over near Dawsonville, Georgia."

After the water is found, the well is dug [see following section]. He can't
tell you how deep you might have to dig. It could vary greatly.
We had a chance to see a well found by Mr. Arrowood, and we talked
with the diggers, Tom Ramey and Harold Embrey [see following section].
"Money is why we dug the well. He found the well with a probing rod.
That's a copper wire. He can also use a peach-tree limb or a clothes hanger.
I don't know anybody who is as accurate as Mr. Arrowood in finding
water. There [pointing] is a stream, and here is a stream, and they cross
right here where he told us to dig. We hit it, too. We are going to dig four
or five more feet to make a reservoir for the water to store in."
After watching the process of dowsing for water, we all agreed that we
could not explain it. We just had to believe it works. As Mr. Arrowood said,
"It's just a gift from God is all I know. It don't matter what kind of stick
you use. I think the main thing is to believe in it yourself."

DIGGING A WELL
Whenever a house was built where there was no spring close by, the peo-
ple dug a well.
Digging a well was a dangerous task. The men we interviewed told us
that there were a lot of problems in digging one. They could be digging and
have something fall in on them. When you're down sixty to seventy-five feet
and a rock falls in and hits you, you're as good as dead. Or others could be
hauling you out in the bucket, and just as you get to the top, the rope could
break and back you'd go. Or you could hit a gas pocket and pass out.
One thing that scared Kenny Runion was looking up when he was way
down in the hole digging. He said the hole at the top of the well looked just
like an auger hole. He felt like he was trapped in there. Mr. Ledbetter
agreed: "When you're down in there and the sun is shining on top, the hole
don't look much bigger than a nickel. Some people say that when you're
deep enough to hit water, you can look up and see stars, but I never have."
Starting a well usually required three people: one to do the digging and
two to wind the windlass that cranks the bucket up, and also to keep the
rim of the well cleaned off so that nothing would fall in on the person dig-
ging it. The bucket is used to bring the dirt up and to bring the man up
when he is finished. Sometimes men used horses to pull the bucket up. Mr.
Ledbetter said, "I pulled the dirt out of my well at home with a mule.
Somebody used a horse once and ran around with a big knot on his head

because the horse pulled him up so fast. I wouldn't trust a horse; not unless
two people were holding it."
Some of the men, when starting a well, used the rim of a wagon wheel
and traced around it. Then they started to tunnel their way down. The
tools used in digging a well were a short-handled mattock and shovel. They
dug straight down until they hit water. Kenny knew a guy that had to go
forty-five feet deep through rock, blasting with dynamite, until he finally hit
water.
Once they hit water, they would continue on down about another eight
feet to make sure they had a good strong vein and lot of storage space to
hold the water in. Then they'd rock the walls up to four feet above water
level, or all the way to the top if the walls were weak. The well was then
ready to use.
In doing this article about well digging, I gained a lot of respect for the
men who dug for a living—it's a dangerous job and would be scary.

How to Dig It
The four men we interviewed were Kenny Runion, Harley Rogers, Law-
ton Brooks, and Mr. Ledbetter. In the following pages, each of them talks
about his individual experiences.
KENNY RUNION: When I was a teen-ager, I used to go from place to
place with my father digging wells. We'd dig them about three feet across
through the center. The way me and my daddy done, we used a wagon tire.
We'd just lay that down and mark it plumb around and cut into the
ground about three or four inches. Then I'd follow that to get started. If I
ever got down a foot deep, I had it made. A man could dig his length a day
in dirt. And when I got done with that thing, it would be as round as a dol-
lar at the bottom. Round as a gun barrel.
About the only tool I'd use would be a shovel with a foot-long handle. If
the whole handle was broke out, you'd be better off. It's so narrow in there
you just can't use one. And you can dig three ways: on your side up against
the bank, or on your knees, or stand on your head and shoulders. And if you
hear that bucket a'coming, you hit on your head and shoulders or it's
gonna knock a place on your head.
When we started, Dad would help me as deep as where it got to his head.
Then he wouldn't work no more down in there. It was all up to me then.
I'd stay with it. The first day or two you could go pretty fast because you
could shovel the dirt up and throw it right out. But now the next day you
were stuck. You would have to have the dirt pulled out with a winch. Dad
would do that part and I would shovel. There was a rope tied to a
bucket, and when it came back into the well, I'd fill it with dirt and rocks
and he was on top and would roll it out. All I'd have to do was dig, shovel,
and load up when he sent the bucket back. Dollar a foot.
And now the walls had to be straight to where the bucket wouldn't hit
them and chunk out rocks as it went up. It had to be done right like a gun
barrel. And it can't angle. If it does, it'll slide out on you or the water'll hit
that high place and get muddy every time. It's got to be just as square as
square itself if you're to get good water.
If you come to rock, you have to blast. You used to get dynamite. It
looked like sawdust, but, boys, it was more than sawdust! And black
powder—you could buy it in twenty-five- or fifty-pound cans, and it was as
good, if not better, than dynamite.
Now digging the holes for the dynamite was slow, I reckon! It'd take you
a day or two to get them holes down. They had to go down about two feet
to get that dynamite in there. I guess you could just drill one hole in the

middle, but it would tear up the bottom and leave it in a bad shape. You
want to blast it to where the walls are smooth, so you should drill clean
around the edge and put in about six holes. Put about a half-stick to each
hole; and then the dynamite would just blow back to the wall if you drilled
right.
To drill those holes, a fellow turned and I drove with a hammer. He was
a small fellow, and he sat flat down and he'd put that drill right between his
legs. He'd double up some way or another, and I'd put the eight-pound
hammer to it. If I'd missed, I'd of hurt him, I guess, but I never did. And
it'd take a half a day to put down one hole in that blue granite rock. 'Course
if it was soft, it'd go quicker. After you got the holes drilled, you'd take dy-
namite down, fill them holes full, put in your cap, light it, and get out if you
could! You'd better get out. That stuff burns about a foot a minute, so
you'd put about three or four feet of fuse. It'll give you time to get out if
something don't happen. Now if the rope breaks, you're a gone man! You
wouldn't have time to tie it back, and you couldn't put the fuse out. A man
might jerk it out, but the blamed cap would blow. You just can't put that
fuse out. And that cap is might' nigh as bad as the dynamite. Tear your
head off! I've see'd a fellow here at town—him and another boy got out
some dynamite caps and was hitting them, and every one of his fingers is off

============================================================

and his thumb too. That's one thing, boys, you've got to be careful with.
You can't light them with a match, either. You got to get a stick of fire and
just take the coal and stick that coal to the fuse and she's gone!
Or if you were using powder, you'd pour some powder in a bucket and
take it down in the well. You'd pack it in the holes. That's a dangerous
thing, ain't it? If the powder don't go off, it's dangerous to go in there. You
can't get it out 'cause it's packed.
And after you blasted, you'd have to stay out a couple of hours. That dy-
namite smoke will hurt you. Can't get your breath. Then when you go back
in, you have to get the rocks out. If there's a rock down in there too big to
lift out in the bucket, you have to bust it with a hammer.
Now how deep you go depends on when you hit water. You could go
down anywhere from thirty feet on. I've been in them so deep that if you
look up toward the top, it looks like an auger hole—about the size of a sil-
ver dollar. The best thing, boys, is to never look up. Look down. If you look
up, it looks smothersome. You be down seventy-five or a hundred feet down
in the ground in that small of a hole and it'll smother you if you ain't care-
ful. You'll get scared. The best way to do is don't never look up no
difference what comes in.
When you first hit water, go right on down. Some people want you to
have at least six feet of water in there, but you could get out with four. If
the water is boiling right straight up, you've got it. If it's running out of
rock, it's pretty doubtful that it might go dry during a dry spell. Then when
it's dug, you want to wall it. You start at the bottom and go around and
around. It's best not to put a flooring on the bottom because you need to let
the water come in. You stick the rocks in the mud all the way up and the
wall will hold up itself. At the last round, you want to lean the rock back to-
wards the dirt and that'll hold it. If you wall a well right, it won't ever give
you trouble. You don't have to wall it all the way to the top, but I have
done it that way. There's a well up here in town where me and my daddy
walled it to the top and put a rock curbing on it. We took a big rock and put
it there on the side where she could set her bucket.
And then you have to keep it clean. I've cleaned out a lot of wells before.
You get a lot of cans and bottles in them. When you go to clean a well out,
you draw the water out of it to where you can see wh?.t's in the bottom.
You'll find dippers and bottles and no telling what in there.
It's dangerous work, but you only made forty cents a day on top, and
you could make fifty cents a foot through dirt and p dollar through rock
digging wells. But you were always taking chances. Rope break while you
were being lowered into the well, and you'd go to the bottom and I don't
mean maybe. I used to just go down the rope—just swing down it, slide

down it to the bottom. That's pretty dangerous. Or that bad air down at
the bottom. It's dangerous work.
LAWTON BROOKS: I've dug four wells myself. I've cleaned out several
of them, but I've dug four from the start to the finish. Usually it don't take
but three men—two to rope and one to do the digging. Can't but one work
down in there anyway. Ain't got room for two down in there.
To start, I always just lay out about a four-and-a-half-foot round circle.
Then I commence in the middle and dig out to the edge plumb around
there. Then I get it started and keep it down straight all the way. After you
get down head deep or a little better, then you can tell by looking at your
walls if it's off and if everything is going straight. You dig down about two
or three foot with the maddock; then take your spade and get all that out
and straighten your walls. Send up four or five bucketfuls of dirt and then
set down again and dig. The fellow up on top is a'resting while you're a'dig-
ging. The man who's digging is the man with all the work because he has to
dig and he has to load, and all they have to do is roll up the dirt. While
you're a'digging, they're talking or smoking or even eating.
The reason I start with a four or four-and-a-half-foot circle is because
you've got to have room so you can use your short-handled tools in there to
dig with. You're down on your knees doing the digging and the shoveling.
The only time you stand up is when you're smoothing your banks [walls]
down. It's pretty hard swinging that maddock because you have to dig sit-
ting on your knees. You can't come back like you would if you had a long-
handle. You could dig as fast again then, but you can't do it. It's a lot like
driving a nail with a hammer—you do just a little at a time.
Then when I get ready to come out for lunch, or to quit, why they just
send the bucket down and I just put one foot in the bucket and the other on
the side of it and reach up there and get ahold of the rope and ride right up
to the top.
I hen when you're getting to the water, your dirt will go to getting damp;
and if you keep on, it will go to getting a little bit wetter. After a while,
you'll see the water heaving in over on one side and maybe on the other
side, and you just keep on going down until after a while you will hit a good
vein of water. Dig down about three feet below it. Then you will never have
no trouble about water coming in.
One trouble is that most of the time when you dig a well, you hit rock.
Now me and a Hopper boy dug one in solid rock. Me and him dug one for
a fellow, and we just barely got under the top of the ground and hit solid
rock. He told me to go right on and dig. He wanted that well right there, so
I did what he said. We just put in a little piece of dynamite and blowed out
two or three little chunks. Then we drilled another hole and blowed out an-

============================================================
PAGE 371
============================================================

374 
FOXFIRE 4
other chunk or two. Kept on going around and around. Blow out a chunk
or two and throw them out; then drill another little hole and take a piece of
a stick of dynamite and blow out another chunk or two. We done that till
we got on down there and hit water. Now it had a rough bank. It didn't
have no smooth bank. 'Course when it would stic k out too far, we'd take a
hammer and beat some of that off the best we could. But it was a job get-
ting that one done. But we didn't have to wall it since it was all rock to start
with.
Sometimes when you're getting pretty close to water you might hit a
streak of sand, and it might just cave out. When you dig down and it goes
to doing that, you might have to wall it with rock. Just take you some rock
and come in right down here at the bottom and lay your rock around and
just go on around with it—wall it up just as high as it's caving and a little
above that. That rock will keep it from caving anymore. And the water
won't let your rocks fall out of place if you place them right. Make them fit
just as best as you can, but don't put anything like cement between them.
Your water has to come through there.
And you dig it to where you have anywhere from six to eight foot of
water in your well. You ought to have that much water in your well for a
good well. Then your water don't get muddy when you go to drawing, you
know. These ladies used to have to draw the water to wash with, and it took
a lot of bucketfuls to do a good washing, you know. If your well wasn't
pretty deep, then you going up and down with that old bucket so many
times would get it muddy. But if you got plenty of water, you ain't bothered
with that mud or nothing.
When you finish the well, it just takes a day or so for the mud to settle to
the bottom. The next day you can go out and draw the water out. Then let
it fill back up. Then it will settle down again and the water will be just as
clean as it could be because after that your bucket never goes down to the
bottom. You'll have anywhere from six to eight feet of water, and you never

let your bucket go down and hit the bottom until it has to be cleaned out.
Stuff will fall off the banks and get in there and that's what causes you to
have to go back and take out all that old mud and stuff out back to the bot-
tom. Then you'll have your clean water again right off.
HARLEY ROGERS: Whenever I dug a well, I always charged by the
foot. If I was to take a contract to dig it, I might make a little on it, or lose
a little on it, see? So I always dug it so much a foot.
And the only tools I use is a shovel and a maddock. I cut the handles off
them. And I dig them three, maybe three-and-a-half foot in diameter—just
as little as I can and still work in them. How long it takes depends on how
deep you have to go. You might dig one here and go down maybe twenty-
five or thirty feet; and then another one might go fifty-five or sixty. Then it
starts getting a little bit slower. You can't work near as fast.
But I very seldom had to go over thirty feet till I struck water. The last
well I dug, I believe it was twenty-nine feet, and it was high up on the
mountain. I reckon we just hit a vein or something down in there.
You can go pretty fast in dirt. The first day, two hands can go down
twelve or fifteen foot, and then from there on you gradually go off a foot or
two a day. Some days you don't get maybe three foot because the dirt gets
harder down in there, you know, and you got all that that has to be loaded

and hauled out, and that takes a little time. You have to do that with a
windlass and a big rope and a bucket. You ride down in the bucket, and stay
down until you change shifts or get tired, and another one goes down and
you come up and roll the dirt out for him. I generally stayed down there
most of the time myself. It's easier down in there than it is to load and
unload on top. And you really need two men on top—like you need two sur-
geons when they're operating on you. One man could pull me up himself,
but something could hit him on the arm, or it cramp or something, and it
would just jerk right out of his hand. So you got the other man on this side
who carries you on out where it could have dropped back down and killed
you. That's the only reason why you got two men to help you.
And then after you go down, say, twenty foot or so, I've always found
that you've got to take it steady. You can't hit that lick or two real fast. If
you do, well, your breath is all gone. And don't never smoke a cigarette
down in a well because that seems like it takes the oxygen out or some-
thing. It just fogs it up.
Then if you hit rock, you have to drill. I always just used a hammer and
a piece of steel. I always had somebody to chuck my steel for me. I never
could get nobody to drive for me. I always had to drive myself. Afraid they
would hit me. I didn't care if I hit them!
Then when it goes to getting damp, you've got it. If the dirt is soft, they
tile the walls nowadays; but used to you just dig it plumb on down and
then rock it up—wall it up. That ought to be six feet below where you first
hit water. Ought to have six foot of storage on account of you use more
water now than you used to. You used to just draw it out in a bucket, and if
you could make it with one bucket, you made it. But now you don't care
how much you use. And if the walls are good, hard clay, you're okay. Just
rock it up, say, two or three feet above the water level. Then it'll never cave.
You don't use cement. You just lay the rocks in there. Go right to the bot-
tom, and then lay some rock in there—down into the bottom, you know—
for the sand trap.
Then once in a while you have to clean it out. You draw all the water
out just as fast as you can, and then you go down in there and clean it out.
Get the- dippers and everything. It used to be we might get ten or twelve
dippers out of the well when I was a boy. You'd keep dropping one and
leaving it—just go get another one. You'd have those to get out.
Problems
Well digging was just about as hazardous a job as could be found in the
mountains. One man we talked to told us about a friend of his who almost

wot killed one day: "He was cleaning out his daddy's well. They were
bringing him up and he got to the top, and just as he got to the top the rope
broke and he went back down—him, the bucket, and all. It broke his leg
twice, but he finally got all right. He limped all the rest of his days though.
I don't know how many feet it was he fell, but just as he started to climb
out he put one hand on the bank and the rope broke and back he went
bucket and all. That's what got me studying about that, too. I was kind of
scared after that. But it was a job, and jobs was kind of hard to get and I
had to do something to live, so I worked at it."
Perhaps the most terrifying possibility was that of a cave-in. In fact, a
near miss of that sort is what ended Kenny's career as a well digger. As
Kenny tells it: "I dug a well over in town that was fifty foot deep, and it
was pipe clay—white looking dirt. You could slap the bank with a shovel
and it would shake up ten feet. I got it done and I told the woman, 'You'd
better have it walled now. I'm a'feared it'll cave with you.' But I got it done,
built her a curbing and everything; plenty of water. And a few days later I
went back to see how it was doing, and you could reach the bottom with
your hand! It filled slap-dab up! I was crazy for working in there. When I
see'd that bank shake, I ought to have got out of there. Of course I was dig-
ging on a contract and I wouldn't have got no pay.
"You couldn't dig it out again because it would just keep caving. I
wouldn't have took a job putting that well back for a thousand dollars. I
could have dug a new one easier than I done that. Now boys, you can't run
in a well! They ain't a thing you can do only just take it. Anything comes in
from the top, you just set right there with it. And if it caves, if they've got
time they'll pull you up. If they don't, they just kill you up. Now it comes in
quick, boys. Ain't no fooling. When it starts, it starts pushing out the bot-
tom and just comes in like that [clapping his hands together once]. They
might as well leave you. You're done dead anyhow, and you're sure enough
down in the ground—done buried. I don't know whether you could get a
man out of a well or not.
"That well digging and topping trees is two things that I've quit. I'd eat
bread and water before I'd do her again. I never aim to dig another well.
When that one done what it done in town, I said, 'Farewell, I'll never dig
another one.' And I ain't."
Harley Rogers agreed about the danger: "If you hit sort of a slick place
that's easy cut, you better be watching that. Maybe you get down in there
about twenty-five feet and the whole side of that just drop off. If it's any bit
slick, you better tile it from there. And I'd take caution if the wall had a
crack in it while you were digging it 'cause that crack could lead to a slide-
off, you know. A load of dirt falling in on you—it'll kill you. Smother you
to death."

============================================================

Another common problem associated with the job was that of gas and
bad air. Lawton ran into that sort of thing several times: "We had an old
home place, and we had a well there that my daddy and I dug right on top
of a mountain. I dug eighty-two feet and I hit bad air in there and that liked
to killed me. I didn't finish it up. It wasn't but about three more feet to dig
till the water was there, but he went and got this old colored man that dug
wells to come on over there and help. But I liked to passed out. I hollered
and they sent the bucket down. I got to the top and couldn't get out of the
bucket. They had to drag me out—laid me on the porc*h till I finally come
to. It's a funny feeling. It felt like me and the well and everything was just a
rising up. My head felt as big as the top of that table. It's some kind of dead
air, and it just makes you feel plumb old funny. My head felt as big as that
bucket that I was riding up and down in. It felt like everything was just
moving—wheels—like you were rolling on earth.
"My daddy wouldn't let me go back down in it no more after that, but
this old colored guy came and he said, 'Well, you're getting pretty close to
water.' Then he asked if we had any newspaper or anything, and they said,
'Yeah.' So he went and got himself a big old bunch of newspaper and lit it
and threw it down in the well and let it burn. Then he got in the bucket
and said, 'I'm ready to go down.' And he went on down there and dug on
down, and sure enough, he hit water. It was still a good old well when I left
home. Never had no more trouble with it.
"But all the old well diggers I have talked to said that if you're going to
hit that air, you will hit it within two to three feet of the water. It could kill
you if you don't get out and get you some air. They have been people killed
with it. I had a lot of well jobs offered me after that, but my daddy said,
'You ain't going to dig any more wells.'
"And I listened to him."
Kenny also ran into gas sometimes. "One thing I dreaded was that gas.
If you had a moustache, a heap of times you'd come out of there and it
would be black as a crow. You'd have gas on your beard. Yeah, that gas'll
kill you, man.
"And don't talk none when you're digging a well—only when you have
to. Don't talk. You're sucking that gas in your lungs. You can hear that gas
spew out of the banks every once in a while. When you get to where you
throw a newspaper around and it won't burn, you better get out. You've hit
her then. Wait till that gas gets out and then you can go back. And if the
gas gets to where you can't stand up, don't come up. Just stand there till
that gas gets weaker because when you come to the top and hit this pure
air, back you'll go, by the way. You're dead. You got to watch that stuff,
man.
"That there gas generally comes out between two crevices of rocks. You

can hear her a'spewing. If you burn newspapers in there, that'll help you
some if you can get a match to strike. A blamed match just won't hardly
strike down there.
"That's one place you won't smoke. If you're a smoker, you'll not smoke
in there. You'll choke.
"See, no air can't hit you. Just what you suck in from the top. I believe a
man digging a well needs air pumped into him."
In addition, there was also the danger that a prankster—or someone who
simply wasn't being careful enough—could knock something into the well
while a man was down below. As Lawton said, "No, that's one thing I told
them to do is that every time I go down to keep everybody away from there.
Better be nobody fooling around on top of that well while I was down
there. I got people I could depend on standing right there on top so nobody
could come in and look in—sightseers, you know. They could kick off some-
thing in on you. You take a real small rock and drop it and it could kill you
dead as a hammer down there at eighty feet. The people working with me
would always draw out a few buckets and as they did it, always keep that
stuff clean back away from the well. I've had dirt to fall back on me, and
I've had my head cracked a time or two with little bitty rocks. They weren't
big, but it doesn't take much to crack your head when you're way down in
there. Feels like someone's hit you with a baseball.
"I cleaned one well that was ninety-two feet deep, and that's when I was
scared because there was a big old rock there that went out in the well
about a foot out from the side. It was so big, you couldn't get it out. You
had to bypass it. After I got down below it in under this rock here and
looked up and just seen the bottom of that thing there with nothing under-
neath to hold it up, I just thought, 'There ain't a thing to keep you from
coming on down here with me.' I tell you, you feel funny looking up at a
big old rock like that. But I told him I would clean it out, and I did."
Harley remembered getting hit a few times: "Even a little rock as big as
a marble down there about twenty feet—it'll flatten you. You have to wear
a hard hat down in there, and then it goes like dynamite when it hits you in
the head!"
Kenny had some even wilder things happen to him while he was dig-
ging: "I've had halves of buckets of rock and mud poured back on me. No
protection at all. Just the hair on your head is all you've got.
"I was working down in a well one morning and some old boys were
standing around on top. Had an old pistol they was up there trying to sell
it—and the cylinder fell out. Just as it happened, I was standing up against
the bank and it mired up in that dirt, believe it or not! If I'd been over
thataway at work, it would have killed me as sure as you're setting there.

"And one time a boy caught an old cat and put that thing in a sack and
shook it down on me. That thing tore me up! The first time, he didn't lack
over ten feet getting out, but after a while, he was just down there with me.
And catch that thing—you couldn't. I said, 'It's going out or me.' I hated
to kill it. My sister—I guess she was on top crying about it—but I finally
sent him out in the bucket. If I hadn't had on a new coat, it'd'a'tore me to
pieces! I had on a jacket, and it hit me on the back with its four feet. A
cat's eyes sparkle in the dark. I was down in the dark, and you couldn't see
a man digging down in there. That thing tried its best to tear me all to
pieces. I was scared, and I couldn't run. I had to kill it with a shovel.
"I don't reckon I got out till about dinnertime that day. I'd a'whipped
that boy or he would me. I was wild. I'd'a'tore him up, and he knowed it,
too. He left. They wouldn't let me out of there till he left. I hated they
didn t throw a dog in on me. I could have caught a dog and held him.
I hem blame cats arc tough. If I'd been outside, they'd a'been somebody
hurt.
" Then I went one time to finish up a well. Had two old boys there, and it
was deep. They said, 'Get in and we'll let you down.' Have you ever seen a
well windlass? Well, when I got in the bucket, they turned me loose. You
talk about hitting the bank and bottom, I hit it! The bottom was rock, by
the way.
"That's a bad way for a man to get water. There's too much water on
top for a man to risk his life in a well."

BERRY BUCKETS
B
erry buckets are traditional con-
tainers made of bark. Jason
Townsend's parents used them
for picking berries on Grandfather Mountain. Jason has continued to make
them, as there is a big tourist demand for them. While they can be made
from the bark of tulip poplar, chestnut, white walnut, hickory, or box elder,
the most popular, and the bark Jason uses exclusively, is that of the tulip
poplar. Jason gathers the bark when the sap is up (about the first of June
PLATE 355

============================================================
PAGE 380
============================================================

BERRY BUCKETS

through the new moon in August), and at the same time gets hickory strips
for lashing the buckets together at the top and sides.
To peel the bark off the tree, Jason uses either a "spud," a chisel-like
tool, or a sharp stick. After he has peeled the bark as high as he can reach,
he will cut the tree down, take the remainder of the bark off the tree, and
use the wood for stovewood. He has to make the buckets within a week. If
he doesn't, the bark dries out too much. To prevent the bark from drying
out while waiting to work it up, he puts it in a creek or damp place, which
keeps it pliable longer.
Fold up the sides of
the bark and lace to-
gether from the bottom
with hickory strips.
The slit for the bottom of the bucket may be circular or oval.

============================================================
PAGE 381
============================================================

In order for him to make the buckets, Jason also needs hickory bark for
the laces. When he gathers it, he makes a slit around the tree and yanks up-
ward. If the bark becomes too hard to peel, he waits till the new moon
when the bark again loosens. He "rosses" or takes off the top layer of bark,
and uses the second or sap layer for the lacing, the hoop, and the bail (han-
dle) of the buckets. He stores the extra hickory strips in rolls and wets them
as he needs them.
Here is how he does it:
He cuts the bark to twice the length and the same width as he wants the
bucket to be. He shapes the bucket bottom by carving a deep oval or circu-
lar slit around the outside center (see Plate 356), into but not through the
bark. Jason then folds up the sides, creasing the bark at the slit. They
should be even if the oval or circle was cut in the correct place. He trims off
the rough edges on the bottom of the bucket with his pocketknife, and
punches five holes on each side and a row of holes about an inch apart all
the way around the top (see Plate 356). Using a strip of hickory bark, he
starts at the bottom of the bucket and laces it up like a shoe. When both
sides are laced, he has enough hickory bark left to lace around the top rim
inside the bucket. To make the rim, he takes a hickory split about an inch
wide and a little longer than the circumference of the top of the bucket, and
overlaps the ends into a hoop that will just fit inside the bucket top. He
places the rim inside the bucket and laces the hickory bark all the way
around in one direction and then comes back the other so the laces cross.
For the bail, he uses hickory because the tourists like it. Mountain people
used to use cloth so it wouldn't cut into their shoulders: overall galousies
(straps) were ideal.

CHEESE MAKING
O
n our most recent trip into the
area 
around 
Vilas, 
North
Carolina, 
we 
were 
visiting
Charlie Ross Hartley and his wife (see chapter in this book) when his
neighbor, Milton Hodges, came over to see us. She's been enthusiastic about
Foxfire for some time, and, knowing that we were interested in meeting
people who could show us how to make cheese, offered to help us meet them.
It was through her that we met Mrs. Monroe Reese and Mrs. Thelma Earp
—she actually set up the interviews for us and showed us the way to their
homes. She's that kind of person.
We were also able to pick up some additional information from Tedra
Harmon (see sled-making chapter in this book); and, from our own area,
Harriet Echols and Aunt Nora Garland (see Foxfire 9, page 465) told us
how they make cottage cheese.
The first person we talked with was Mrs. Reese (Plate 357). Her hus-

band was out working around their farm when we arrived, so we went
straight up to their house where she showed us into her spotless, sunlit
kitchen. As we took pictures, she showed us the process she follows for mak-
ing the blocks of cheese that she and her husband like best. She has occa-
sionally sold some to bring in a little extra money.
Mrs. Reese begins with two and a half gallons of refrigerated, whole milk
from their cow. She pours this all into a large pan and heats it on her wood
stove (Plate 358) until it is a little past lukewarm. She prefers a wood stove
as it gives a slower, steadier heat.
When the milk is warm, she takes the pan off the stove and adds one-
fourth of a Hansen's Cheese Rennet Tablet dissolved in one teacup of
water, and one-eighth of a Hansen's Cheese Color Tablet dissolved in one
teacup of water. Both these tablets are available in drug stores, and di-
rections for their use are listed on the containers.
She lets the milk sit for from fifteen to thirty minutes until it stiffens and
gets jellylike. Then she cuts it with a knife or spatula into tiny squares, also
running the spatula under the surface as if cutting it into layers.
Letting it sit briefly, she then works the mixture until it is all broken up
into pieces that are about the size of grains of corn. She works it gently

============================================================

PLATE 361
(Plate 359), squeezing the custardlike substance until it is completely bro-
ken apart. Then she puts the pan back on the stove and heats the mixture
slowly until it is almost as hot as the touch can stand—but not boiling.
While it is reheating, she stirs it constantly so that the curds will stay sepa-
rated and not melt back together. She then removes the pan from the stove
and lets it sit for from fifteen to thirty minutes to cool, and then strains the
contents through cheesecloth in the colander she has ready on her sink
(Plate 360). She does not squeeze the mixture dry—she lets it drip natu-
rally and then returns the mixture to the pan, adds a heaping teaspoonful
of salt, and massages it in well (Plate 361).
Finally she puts the contents of the pan into a homemade press which she
has lined with cheesecloth (Plate 362). Adding weight in stages (Plate
363), she leaves it in the press overnight, or twelve hours, to press the cheese
down into a firm block. She then removes it from the press (Plate 364),
and dries it for a week in the open air with a cloth underneath the cheese to
absorb any additional moisture. She turns it two times a day during this
drying process, during which the cake of cheese forms a dry crust on the
outside. It should keep fine without spoiling for a month or more,
Before rennet tablets were available, cheese of this sort was still possible

to make. Tedra Harmon remembers that when they killed a cow for
butchering, they would get the stomach out, cut it open, and clean it well.
Then they would stretch it out in one piece to dry like a banjo hide. After it
was thoroughly dry, they rolled it up and hung it in a bag from a conven-
ient rafter. Whenever his mother made cheese of the sort just described, she
would use a tiny piece of the stomach lining (about the size of a thumb-
nail) to curdle the milk, just as the rennet tablets are used now. He also
remembers his mother using a small piece of the stomach lining when mak-
ing light bread. He remembers it giving the bread a sour taste.
The cheese his mother made was pressed into wooden hoops that were
from twelve to fourteen inches in diameter. The cheese would be set up in
the attic to dry for six to eight weeks before being cut, and he remembers
that the older the cheese got, the better it tasted.
Mrs. Thelma Earp, also introduced to us by Milton Hodges, makes a
different kind of cheese. It can be eaten right away. In fact, it was so good
that we wound up taking half a cake along with us in the car and nibbling
on it all the way home.

PLATE 364
Before we got to her house, she had clabbered the milk and had it wait-
ing in the refrigerator. To do this, she took whole milk, allowed the cream
to rise, skimmed it off and made butter (Plates 365 and 366). Then she
added two-three tablespoons of buttermilk per gallon of skimmed milk and
let it sit out for two days and sour. She put this in the refrigerator to await
use.
When we arrived, she went right to work, pouring two gallons of the
clabbered milk into a pan and heating it on the stove until it was a little
hotter than lukewarm. She said it should be pretty hot, but not boiling, and
not so hot that it would burn your hands.
Once the clabbered milk is thoroughly heated, she pours it into a strainer
made with a cotton cloth pinned over a bucket with clothespins (Plate
367). She then gathers up the corners of the cloth "and squeezes the whey
through the cloth, leaving the curds. "The best thing to do with the whey,

now, is feed it to the hogs," she laughed. Going outside, she poured the
whey into the slop bucket.
She then puts the curds in a bowl and adds one and one-half teaspoons of
salt and a raw egg. She prefers barnyard eggs to store-bought ones as they
make the cheese yellower. She mixes it all in with her hands (Plate 368),
readying it for cooking.
Now she puts a lump of butter about the size of a large hen egg into a big
iron frying pan and melts it. She prefers a wood cookstove because it heats
more evenly and slowly. The electric stove used here belongs to her daugh-
ter, and it heated the cheese too fast and got some burned flakes of butter
mixed in with it.
When the butter is melted, she adds the curds and keeps turning them in
the pan over medium heat (Plate 369). When all the curds are melted
enough to run together into a cake, she puts them out into a dish to cool
Plate 370). As they cool, they automatically form a cake,
She recommends that you, "Go to eating on it" (Plate 371), but you can
wait several days. It should not be refrigerated as it should dry out some-
what. After a short while, it gets hard enough to cut into slices. It should
keep about a week.

COTTAGE CHEESE
We asked Mrs. Harriet Echols to tell us how she makes cottage cheese for
her family and below are her directions with some additional comments
from Mrs. Nora Garland. Mrs. Echols was unable to get raw milk to actu-
ally show us the steps at the time of the interview, so we do not have pic-
tures of her method, but felt that her instructions would be quite dear to
you.
To begin the process of making cottage cheese, pour about a gallon of
raw (unpasteurized) whole milk into an enamel or other metal pan. Any
amount of milk may be used. The amount used here is what is preferred by
Harriet Echols for her family. Mrs. Echols lets her pan of milk sit on the
back of the wood stove in the winter or just out on a kitchen table during
warm weather, so that it can sour slowly. This process may only take one
day, or perhaps two, according to the temperature. Mrs. Echols does not
heat the milk at all before it clabbers. When on the stove, it is not over di-
rect heat—only in a warm place.
After the milk clabbers, the cream is lifted off and refrigerated. The
cream may be used later as sour cream in any recipe, or it may be mixed in
with the cottage cheese after it is made to make the cheese creamier.
The skimmed, clabbered milk is then heated over a low fire until it cur-
dles. It is removed from the heat and poured into a colander or cheesecloth
to drain all the water. This usually takes a couple of hours. It may also be
hung in a cloth overnight. Mrs. Nora Garland remembers that she put the
curdled milk into a clean flour sack and let it drain overnight outside.
Both Mrs. Garland and Mrs. Echols told us that they would then work
the cheese by putting it back into a pan or bowl and squeezing it with their
hands or a spoon or spatula, getting out any remaining water. Mrs. Echols
warned us not to work the cheese too vigorously or get the curds too fine.
Ihen a little salt may be sprinkled in to taste, and to make the cheese
creamier some of the sour cream may be mixed in with it. The cottage
cheese is then packaged in small containers and refrigerated. It will keep
several weeks in the refrigerator.
Mrs. Monroe Reese also makes cottage cheese, but her method is slightly
different. She removes the cream first, lets the milk clabber, warms it on the
stove, strains it through cheesecloth, adds salt and pepper to taste, and then
adds some of the (ream back to keep it from getting dry and hard. She eats
it either warm or (hilled, and tries to finish it within two days.

REV. A. RUFUS MORGAN
R
ufus Morgan, semiretired Epis-
copal minister and native of
Macon 
County, 
North 
Caro-
lina, is now eighty-nine years old, somewhat hard of hearing, and with such
poor eyesight that he subscribes to the Library of Congress's talking books
for the blind. He recognizes his friends and acquaintances only when they
step close to him. In spite of these apparent handicaps, he still hikes the
Nantahala Mountains within sight of his home, and the Smoky Mountains,
with his hiking friends. He still ministers to the small St. John's Episcopal
Church of Cartoogechaye.
He has such a wonderful memory and such a way of telling about events
in his life that we asked him to start at the beginning of his life, October 15,
7885, and tell us all about himself. Since his great-grandparents were
some of the first settlers of this area, we were able to tie in Indian history
and other early stories that he had been told by his parents and grand-
parents. He told us so much in such an interesting way that we want to
share it all with you so that you might feel what we do about him.
Dr. Morgan is a tall, fine-looking man who speaks in a deliberate, kind
manner. He has a son and a daughter and several grandchildren and great-
grandchildren. He has many cousins, nieces, nephews, and young friends
whom he mentions often in conversation.
Lucy Morgan, one of Dr. Morgan's sisters, helped to establish the
Penland School of Handicrafts in Penland, North Carolina, and has led a
most interesting and productive life, also. She has now retired and lives in
Webster, North Carolina. Their brother, Ralph, was educated as a pharma-
cist, and two of their other sisters went on to college, too.
We asked Dr. Morgan what he felt had influenced so many of the chil-
dren in his family to leave home, and work as hard as they had to, to get &
higher education than they could get in their local area, when this was
definitely not a tradition here in the early 1900s:

PLATE 372 Reverend Morgan.
Our family was always very conscious of education. My mother had at-
tended the St. Mary's School in Raleigh, probably under the influence of
her father, who had studied law at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. My great-grandmother Siler was a sister of the then Governor
°f North Carolina, who had also served as President of the University of
North Carolina during the War Between the States.
My oldest two sisters went to a school that our aunt conducted, a girls'
school down in Hickory, North Carolina. It wasn't college, but it covered
some of the territory that now is college work. My sister Lucy went to a
church school in New York when I was in the seminary up there, and then
she went to the University of Chicago. It's an interesting thing—she never
received an A.B., but she has two honorary doctors' degrees, one from
Chapel Hill and one from a school out in the Middle West. My brother,
Ralph, finished high school and then went on to pharmacy school and be-
came a registered pharmacist. That leaves my youngest sister. I don't think
she graduated, but she went to a teachers' college up in Virginia, where my

oldest sister was living at the time. She lived with her and went to this
school. So most of us had some college work.
My mother was always interested in my going into the ministry. She died
young and when I decided that I wanted to go on and get training, I talked
with my father about getting more education [than I could get at the local
school].
I knew that I'd have to go somewhere else to get even a high school edu-
cation, so my father said, "Why, son, you know that I don't have any
money to send you to school."
I said, "I'm not asking you that. I'm just asking permission to go."
And he said, "Why, of course, I'd be glad for you to."
I went one winter to school at Andrews, North Carolina, and then to a
mission school, Micadale. Then I went to Waynesville to public high school
and graduated there in 1906. In each case, I had worked my way doing
chores. In Waynesville, I stayed in the rectory and did the chores around
the church, Grace Church, mowing the lawn, building the fires, ringing the
bell, sweeping out, all that, and then although I was just a high school stu-
dent, I was made a lay reader. I conducted the simple services, both there
in Grace Church and in a little Negro mission on the edge of town. I went
from there to Chapel Hill and worked my way there.
We first met Dr. Morgan when writing the chapter on "Old-time Bur-
ials" for Foxfire 2. He gave us a beautiful account of his thoughts on bur-
ials, years ago and now, and how he'd like his own final service. Much of
the personality of this remarkable man comes through in the comments he
made on those two or three pages.
Then, during the summer of 1973 we were invited to attend the Siler re-
union in Macon County and behold, there was Dr. Morgan—wearing a
name tag with "William" and his own name on it. We talked to him awhile
at that time. He explained that his great-grandfather William Siler had mi-
grated into the Macon County area with his three brothers, John, Jacob,
and Jesse, in the early 1880s, and all had settled there and reared their
families. So for many years, the descendants of the four Siler brothers have
come from many areas in the United States, and occasionally from Eng-
land, Australia, and other countries, to the annual family reunion in Macon
County, North Carolina:
The four Siler brothers had originally come from Germany or from Swit-
zerland, I'm not sure which. They sailed from Holland with their father
and came first to Pennsylvania. An interesting fact was that they discovered
sweet potatoes and liked them. They were told that sweet potatoes came
from South Carolina, so they came down to what was then the Pendleton
District of South Carolina. Then they came on to the mountains. They

came up to Buncombe County in the region where Asheville is. Then they
drifted over here—all four of them settled in here. William Siler was the
oldest and he had this valley in here—the Cartoogechaye valley. Jackob set-
tled just beyond in the next part of the valley. Then on farther down, John
settled. And Jesse settled in what is now Franklin. He was the most prosper-
ous of the four. He started with an Indian cabin in Franklin and built on to
it. Now it's a three-story house, quite large, and I guess it's the oldest house
in rranklin. Descendants of the Siler family still own and live in the house.
Then Jesse Siler and his family built the old Dixie Hall which stood where
the new courthouse now stands. He also built some other buildings on Main
Street there. And he owned nearly a thousand acres over in what is now the
Smoky Mountain National Park.
In early October of 1973 some of Dr. Morgan's family called and asked
if we had any Foxfire students interested in attending an unusual birthday
celebration—and he came into our lives again. None of us here could go at
the time ana we've always regretted missing a most unique experi-
ence-that 
of climbing Mount LeConte, elevation 6,^gj feet, with a man
celebrating his eighty-eighth birthday to stay overnight at LeConte Lodge
overlooking Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The Lodge is accessible only on foot by
climbing any of several trails a minimum of five to six miles.
Since then, he's celebrated another birthday on Mount LeConte, his

============================================================
PAGE 395

FOXFIRE 4
eighty-ninth. He's been up LeConte nine times this year and 152 times alto-
gether. And he performed a wedding ceremony there a few weeks before his
birthday this year:
I had this telephone call from up in Pennsylvania, and the man wanted
me to perform his wedding ceremony for them up on Mount LeConte.
These two medical students at the University of Pennsylvania had fallen in
love, and had been up to LeConte and had fallen in love with it.
So I told them that we would arrange it, after asking various questions to
see if they were people that I could marry—not divorced and so forth. We
arranged the date, and they got their reservations and we got ours. Mean-
time, of course, there'd been a lot of correspondence—they had to know
about the marriage laws of Tennessee, and I had to know whether I would
be allowed to perform a ceremony in Tennessee.
A couple from Highlands went with me and a great-niece of mine, and
we picked up an Episcopal minister in Gatlinburg to go with us also. There
were five of us and five in the bridal party—the couple and her mother,
sister, and brother.
Our group went up the Trillium Gap trail; they went up the Alum Cave
trail, and we arrived at the lodge about the same time. I had wondered how
they had known there was such a person as I. It turned out that when they
had been up at LeConte sometime before, they saw a picture that a cousin
of mine had taken up there on one of my birthday trips and asked about it.
Then they decided that I'd be a good person to ask to marry them. That
was the reason they got in touch with me. The bride belonged to the
Roman Catholic Church, and the groom belonged to another church—I
can't remember which one.
I had time to talk with them, to counsel with them. Then we had quite a
wedding dinner in the LeConte Lodge—Salisbury steaks, string beans, ap-
plesauce, baked potatoes—the usual LeConte fare. Afterwards, we walked
out to Cliff Top where we go to see the sunset. They had brought a shawl
or something to spread down in front of the couple. I had brought only my
surplice and stole. I got the minister from Gatlinburg, Bruce Green, to hold
the book in case I should stumble, but I didn't; so I performed the cere-
mony right there—a beautiful sunset evening. The bride had picked along
the way some of the simple wild flowers—mountain aster and some of the
others. Then we went back to the lodge and in the new building which
they've almost finished, we had cake and refreshments. The proprietor of
LeConte Lodge, Mr. Brown, and his staff had prepared the wedding cake.
When Dr. Morgan goes on hikes these days, he doesn't go alone due to
his eyesight, and rarely sleeps out overnight now because he can't see to
cook. He usually goes with friends living nearby, or with others who contact

hint that want to go—as long as it's not Saturday or Sunday and might in-
terfere with his conducting church services. Sometimes they have hair-
raising experiences:
There are a good many people whom I suspect of using pain as an excuse
for not hiking. I never know how seriously to take injuries of people. Occa-
sionally I have a few pains here and there, but I don't let them bother me
very much and I don't let my blindness bother me too much, although I
ought to. But I must tell you of one of my most recent experiences.
There's quite an interest now for establishing a William Bartram system
of trails. William Bartram was a naturalist who came down through this
section and went on through Georgia and Florida.
Well, there are some trails taking off from the Appalachian Trail up here
in the Nantahalas, and we have been trying to find out, as near as we could,
where he went because he went through Franklin [read the Travels of
William Bartram, published by Dover Publications, New York, 1955, a re-
publication of the work published by Macy-Masius in 1928 and edited by
Mark Van Doren] back in the Revolutionary days—two hundred years ago.
We've been scouting out some of those trails. I've been over some of them in
years past, and recently [in October] one member of our hiking club, Sally
Kesler, who is the most knowledgeable of our hikers, was assigned the task
of scouting out this trail over Wine Spring Bald down to the Nantahala
Lake. Well, one day she wanted to scout out one section of it over which I
hadn't been for years and years, and she asked me if I'd go with the group
and I said, "Yes."
I like to start out early in the morning, but it is hard to get these folks
with city backgrounds started early. It was almost noon when Sally asked
me about going. So she said, "I'll have to round up a few others to go with
us."
She rounded them up; there were five of us, two men and three women.
By the time we got started, it was about two o'clock that afternoon. There's
a new road that we call locally the Dirty John Road. It turns off at what
used to be called the Dirty John Johnson place. We left Sally's car on that
r°ad, and drove down to the lake and parked the other car where Wine
Spring Creek [so-called because the water from it is so invigorating] runs
into the lake.
So we started. Well, we ought to have had sense enough not to start that
time of day. The old trail was obliterated, grown up in rhododendrons and
laurels and all sorts of things. We had to walk almost in the creek and had
to walk over rocks or logs to get across. I couldn't see very much, of course.
I had one fall and fell backwards. My head sounded like an empty gourd hit-
ting the rocks -I was so glad it didn't burst. Then after a while I fell into a

pool in the creek and got wet all over—just sat down. I still have a wound
that I have to favor somewhat.
As we started up a steep ridge which was slippery, the sun got low and
we made it very slowly. I couldn't see the trail because there wasn't any trail
there, but I knew where we were headed. It got later and later, and finally
it got so dark, nobody could see the way to go. So they said, "Well, we'll
just have to stop."
I said, "We can't spend the night here."
They said, "The rescue squad will find us."
I asked, "How will they find us here?"
After a while, they suggested that we start a fire. It was pretty cool. It
went down below freezing that night. I said that we couldn't—the woods
were too dry, it was too dangerous.
Well, they insisted that we had to have a fire, so they built one. By that
time I was just shivering, I was so cold and wet almost all over. So the fire
was welcome. We didn't have any food; we hadn't brought even a sand-
wich. I had three or four apples, but they refused to eat them. I had a little
jar of water. They refused to drink that. We stood around the fire, turning
one side and then the other, trying to keep from freezing. Occasionally, one
or another of us would lie down beside the fire and try to get a little cat
nap. Fortunately it was a beautiful night, stars all over the heavens, clear as
could be. At two o'clock in the morning, the moon rose and then after four
o'clock, we began to see an outline of the mountains. Finally, it got light
enough so that the others could see the way, so we poured my water on the
fire and dug up some dirt and put on it and got it out. We went on, and
about nine o'clock in the morning, we reached the road where Sally's car
was parked. It just happened that the husband of one of the women of the
party got anxious and started out at midnight, waked up one of his neigh-
bors and they'd been driving around ever since, trying to get some inkling of
where we were. They had discovered the car down by the lake, and when
we got to the road, there they were with a pickup truck. So they took us on
out a little way to Sally's car and they went on down to get the other car
while Sally and I came on home. We hadn't had anything to eat since
lunch the day before. When we got down this side of the mountain, we met
my daughter and son-in law in their pickup. They had started off to hunt
us. So they turned around, followed us in, and came here and cooked
breakfast for us at ten o'clock. It was a foolish sort of thing, but I loved it
very much. Everyone was in good spirits.
This gift he has of welcoming experiences that would make others
shudder and of welcoming people is immediately felt by those who have
never met him before. Marie Auten, for example, picked up on the inter-

views with Dr. Morgan where Linda Warfield had left off with her gradua-
tion in 1974. She felt that warmth immediately upon meeting him, just as
Linda had the first time she went into his home. It was Linda, when inter-
viewing Dr. Morgan on wild plant foods, who had said that she'd love to do
an extended article on him. The obvious answer, "Why not?"
Here is Marie's impression of her first visit to Cartoogechaye and Dr.
Morgan's home:
As we all know, first impressions stand out in our minds—the meeting of
a new person or visiting a new place. The feelings we collect on our first go-
round of a new experience are what dominate our mind and also what we
tell others.
My first experience with meeting Reverend Morgan left a very warm,
loving feeling in me. It wasn't as though he thought of me as a "stranger"
or an "intruder." The love he has for people surrounded me and filled me
as we shook hands. That greeting was more than an introduction to him; it
was a real welcome to his home, the invitation to stay awhile and to come
back whenever I wanted to. This really made me feel good inside, because I
knew he was meeting me as a person, not a school child or because it was
the proper way to greet someone.
Dr. Morgan's two-story frame house is a large house for one person. His

porch stretches all the way across the front of the house with rocking chairs
spaced out so one can relax facing the mountains in any direction he wishes,
and ponder his thoughts.
The front door is always unlocked and open for anyone to come on in.
This really impressed me as I am very accustomed to "being sure the door is
locked when you leave." And yet this man always leaves his door open.
The house is spacious on the inside with a long staircase right in the front
hall going to the upstairs rooms. There is a room to the right of the entrance
which reminds me of a "guest room." On the left of the entrance hall is the
door to his living room, the real heart of the house, where we enjoyed our
visits in front of a large stone fireplace with a crackling fire, with shelves of
books on subjects ranging from birds and trees, plants and mountains, to
fiction, to religion and philosophy on two walls. The fireplace mantel has a
number of statuettes of St. Francis of Assisi with hands outstretched, wel-
coming us into that warm, hospitable room. I later learned why Reverend
Morgan would choose St. Francis as a favorite of his.
At the back of the entrance hall, under the staircase, is an area for his
backpacking equipment. His pack looks all ready as though if he at any
time wanted to go out hiking, he'd pick up and go. He has several sturdy
hiking sticks near the front door, which I suppose he uses for different hikes.
Reverend Morgan has shared with us some of his life's experiences, his

accomplishments, and his disappointments. He has helped me to realize
that everything in life has something to offer—experiences good and bad,
people, nature, everything!
He has lived his life as he felt he should. People have not always agreed
with him, but he has few regrets for the way he had chosen to do things.
Through his words, we have visited many places and witnessed the
beauty of mountaintops through his eyes, things and places we may never
see otherwise. He is a very special person to many people, and we hope you
will enjoy knowing him as we do.

Well, I don't know where to start except where I started. My great-
grandfather William Siler settled over across the valley about 1818. The
story goes that his house was the first house in Macon County that had win-
dows. I remember the house quite well—a long two-story log house with a
porch both upstairs and down the whole length of that house. I've used
some of the logs that I bought from the man that tore the house down. The
owner wanted to build a neat little compact cottage in place of the lovely
old log house. The mantel over the fireplace here is made from one of those
logs and the legs from that rustic table are from the same log.
The top of the table itself is connected with the Cherokee Indian Reser-
vation over at Cherokee, North Carolina. It's a part of the boundary tree
which was the beginning corner of the land that was bought for the Chero-
kees for their Reservation. I like that connection between the boundary tree
of the Cherokees and this log because, if you remember your history, 1818
was just twenty years before the removal of the Cherokees from their moun-
tains here to what was then Indian territory, when the government armed
forces rounded them up at the point of a bayonet. They put as many In-
dians as they could capture on the "Trail of Tears." The local chief here in
the valley, Chief Chuttahsotee, and his wife, Cunstagih, were taken along
with the rest. But when they got over into Tennessee, they escaped and
came back to their mountains and, as the story goes—which I love very
much—they came directly to my great-grandfather's house for protection.
He took them in and then, in order that the government might not remove
them again, he deeded them a tract of land on which they lived out the re-
mainder of their lives. The government couldn't move them if they owned
real estate. So naturally, I connect my great-grandfather Siler's home with
the Cherokee Indians.
I was born up there between where my great-grandfather lived and the
Property that he deeded to Chief Chuttahsotee—born there in a log house
in 1885. I can't remember the log house, but I do remember moving from it

to another little log cabin that I own at the present time. I remember the
moving. Of course, we got around by walking in those days, and I've kept it
up ever since. I was three years old then and the log cabin we moved into
had been built about five years before I was born. I walked across the dam
of the fish pond that my grandfather Albert Siler had built. He loved fishing
and he had two ponds with fish and bullfrogs—one down near the cabin
where we were going and one up on the mountain above here. He raised
carp and liked to have them to eat.
I remember quite vividly coming into that log house over there and the
other people were busy carrying things in and out. I went in the cabin and
got into a seat that was behind a table. It was a little bit hard for me to get
out and I had a desperate feeling wondering whether I would ever get out,
but the others came along soon.
Two or three things I especially remember about life when we lived over
there. We carried water from a spring down the hill a few hundred yards
and my sister was with me. My father had given me a little axe just the
right size for a five-year-old boy. My sister Anna and I stopped at an old log
that was lying beside the trail and began playing there. We picked some bark
off of it, and all of a sudden we came upon a big, long beetle. Her instinct
was to reach out and catch the beetle; my instinct was to use my axe and
chop it in two; and unfortunately, we met about the same time and I al-
most cut off her little finger. She recovered, however.
Another thing that I remember is crossing what we called a buck fence.
Some people call them galloping fences. I was crossing that fence and I dis-
covered, much to my delight, a twenty-five-cent piece. Well, of course I
picked it up and came home rejoicing and showed my mother what I had

============================================================

found. She inquired around and couldn't find whose it was, so she decided,
since we seldom had any money to amount to anything, to let me buy mate-
rial to make kilts because boys at that age wore kilts until they were five or
six years old. We bought the material and my mother made me the dress.
Another thing that I remember about life there at the cabin—we had
been playing there in the yard and a man came to the yard with a load of
tobacco leaves, and of course I wanted one. I wanted to know what to do
with it since my father didn't use tobacco and he said, "You chew it." So he
tore off a piece and suggested that I try it. So I tried it. It made me sick,
and I haven't used tobacco since, so I guess it was a pretty good thing.
I was about five years old when we older children were sent up to the
home of a man we called Uncle Elam Slagle—no kin of ours although the
families have intermarried since. We stayed up there for two or three days.
When we got back home, we found that twins had been born while we were
gone, a boy and a girl.
Most of the farm of my great-grandfather has gone out of the family be-
cause we made a mistake back in those days. My great-grandparents had
nine children, and of course the property which was all of this part of the
valley had to be divided among them. Then my grandparents had nine chil-
dren and it had to be further divided. My parents had nine children, but we
moved over to the next county of Cherokee when I was six years old.
The people traveling then went across Wayah Gap. That was the road
people used in hauling potatoes and apples, and driving turkeys, sheep,
hogs, cattle from way back in the mountains down to Charleston, South
Carolina. They'd camp along the way with a covered wagon and sometimes
stop at stopping places like the Slagles' up on Wayah Creek.
We moved across to Cherokee County in a four-horse covered wagon,
and of course it was slow going. It's only about sixty miles, but it took us
three days. On the way, climbing up the Nantahala mountains by what we
called then the "W's" (because the road went back and forth and formed a
"W" on the side of the mountain), on one of the turns of a "W" I fell out
of the back of the wagon, and of course I let it be known. I had been sitting
on top of what we called a chest—a big wooden box nearly as long as a
sofa. I still have it in my bedroom. Of course, they stopped the wagon and
picked me up. My uncle put me up on the front seat by him and let me
hold the lines and pretend that I was driving.
The first night we stopped at the Monday House and spent the night. I
remember still a swing attached to the limb of a white pine, and the other
children and I amused ourselves by swinging there. The next morning we
started out and crossed the Nantahala River on a covered bridge. They
used to cover them to protect the fabric of the bridge from the weather to
keep them from rotting out. That bridge stayed there until the local power

company built a dam across the river below that and formed a lake and
covered up the Aquone area where we had gone across before.
So Aquone had to move, and the present post office is right down below
the dam. We stop in there occasionally coming from our hikes.
Then the next day we went as far as Andrews and spent the night there.
A tragedy in my young life occurred there—a friendly neighbor over here
had given me a white bantam chicken, so we took it along with us, and to
rest it there at Andrews we put it in the chickenyard. When we went on the
next day to Murphy, we forgot the chicken and I've never seen it since.
Of course there was plenty of work to do. When we boys got a little bit
older, I naturally drifted to the work on the farm, looking after the sheep,
milking cows, chopping wood; and my brother worked in my father's print-
ing office. He was quicker than I. He could set type faster than I, so he got
into that and I did the farming.
During the summer, a lot of times the sheep and the cattle went back in
the mountains to eke out a living feeding on the grass and shrubbery. I
remember one trip especially that my father and I took to look up some of
the wandering sheep. We lived on the point of what was locally called Fort
Butler. It was near where a fort had been during the War Between the
States. It continued around until it became Wildcat Mountain. We went on
around on the side of Wildcat, and this old ex-slave lived back there. Well,
we had gone out before breakfast and stayed out longer than we'd expected
to, and old Aunt Clairsy, as we called her, discovered that we hadn't had
breakfast. She was troubled and certainly we had to have some breakfast,
but she was also racially conscious. So she thought and decided, "Now I'll
put your table out here in the yard and you folks can eat out there."
Well, we were very happy to take advantage of it, so she went in the house
and made some biscuits, fried some eggs and fatback, and I've never tasted
a better breakfast than that. That was the first time that I can remember
that I was impressed by the dew on the grass. At certain angles, there was
just the small sparkle of the dew with the sun coming up, and it was as
beautiful a thing as a diamond bracelet or any other gem. That impressed
me then, and I still love it—that and the spider webs covered with the dew.
After I was up, oh, thirteen or fourteen years old, I would sometimes
work for a relative who lived between our house and town, plowing and
chopping wood and gathering apples and various farm labors. I received a
dollar a day at that sort of work.
In going back and forth to town, we would usually walk, and in those
days there were paths because so many people walked. Quite often, espe-
cially in the wintertime, you couldn't walk in the road because it was too
muddy and there'd be the paths either down the Hiwassee River or along
the road bank.

Our groceries and whatever else would be carried, and I quite often
carried twenty-four-pound sacks of flour out home—a couple of miles.
When we had anything more than that, we had an old mare and we'd hitch
her to the buckboard and drive into town when the roads were passable and
get what we needed and bring it back out.
When we moved over there to Murphy, we lived about two miles out
from town, Cherokee County, and about two miles on farther out was a
country log schoolhouse that we, being country people, instinctively went to
rather than going in the other direction into Murphy. I don't remember
how long we went to that school, but I remember it quite distinctly. It was
built of logs completely; the floor was what we called a puncheon floor—
that is, it was made out of split logs flat-side up. The seats were not like
modern desks, but were made out of split logs without any backs. There was
one shutter to let the light in when it wasn't too cold, but as well as I
remember it, there was no glass and the fireplace chimney was at the end of
the room. The teacher—it was a one-teacher school—was a Mrs. Sherrill
and we enjoyed her very much. Certain smells carry me back to that school-
house, because we took our lunches with us. I remember especially the smell
of sweet corn—roastin' ears.
The school in Murphy was made of bricks and part of the fabric of that
is still standing. It is a part of the hospital that the Roman Catholics built
over there years later.
I got along fairly well with school, I guess, in view of the interruptions.
Of course, like any boy, I would get into fights with the other boys. I
remember one event where some of the boys had disobeyed the rules and
they were in for a thrashing. So the principal of the school [this was in
Murphy], Mr. Monty, sent me out to get some switches for his use. I don't
know whether it was because I was sorry for the boy or afraid of him or
what, but when I brought those switches in, Mr. Monty looked at them and
said, "Those won't do." So he got one of the older boys to go out and get
his switches.
In those days, they had all sorts of traditions, at that school, at least; and
when vacation was approaching, they had a habit of what they called "bar-
nng the teacher out"—getting there before any of the faculty, closing the
doors, fastening them, putting desks and tables up against them so the
teachers couldn't get in. Sometimes they would keep the teachers out and
the teachers would go home, if it was near enough vacation, but sometimes
the teachers would work various tricks. They might send somebody up on
the roof and force some inflammable substance down the chimney and
smoke the boys out. It didn't always come out so well. We had fights among
the older boys. I can remember a couple of the boys of rather prominent
families of the location getting into a fight, and one of them had a knife and

FOXFIRE 4
he went for the other boy intending to cut him down the front. The other
boy bent over, and he ripped him up the back. He lived to tell the tale,
though.
Of course the schools weren't up to the present standards, and then I had
to stay out to work on the farm when I was needed, so I was just a little bit
slow. I attended to the cattle, did various things, and a bit later I was a
butcher on the farm. In raising sheep, we had some to be killed and dressed
and I was the man to do it. If we had a lamb roast, I would go into town
and peddle what we didn't need from house to house.
Back then, we received from ten to twelve cents a pound for lamb, quite
a contrast to present prices. I got so I enjoyed doing that sort of work—
there was an art to it and good, clean work. I didn't like the goats so well.
We had some angora goats in those days. The billy goats among the an-
goras can be quite militant. My brother was younger than I and the old
billy seemed to take a dislike to him, and when Ralph would come into the
lot, the old goat would knock him down and I'd be afraid he was going to
kill him and I'd get a stick and knock the old billy off. Somehow he didn't
seem to hold anything against me, but I had to protect my brother.
I did work in the printing office sometimes, because part of the time
when I was at home, my father was editor of the Cherokee Scout, the
weekly paper, and I would have the job of running the old press—the old
Washington press, I think they called it. A variation of it was the old
Franklin press, and printers then and now were not always on time. So I
would have to work late at night and run the paper off. You've probably
never seen one of them, but the type is set and put on a platform and then a
roller is rolled over the type that has been run in printer's ink to make the
surface for printing the paper and you put a sheet of paper on that and you
run it under a press. Then there's a lever that you have to pull which you
put all your weight against to pull it to press the paper down onto the type.
Then you roll it back out and take the paper off and repeat the process. Of
course, a man would never get a modern paper printed that way. And then
my father did various other printing—books and programs of various kinds.
During my childhood in Cherokee County on the farm, my father, being
a printer, was in Murphy two miles away a good part of the time. His
health wasn't too good; besides, he was not a good business man, so he tried
all sorts of things like canning, raising fruits and vegetables. We had grapes,
gooseberries, raspberries, and asparagus beds. He got equipment for can-
ning vegetables in tin cans. We all helped with that. He had a motto, both
in his printing and his canning, because we sold some of the canned goods
like beans and corn. His motto was "Morgan's Best." Some people thought
he was bragging, but he said, "No, I don't claim it's better than anybody
else's. It's just the best I can do."

He always had dreams. I remember that our place there, on what is now
called Morgan Hill, was named Montevista Farm. He loved the out-of-
doors. He hated to see forest fires. I've known him to fight the forest fires on
his property and on adjoining property practically all night at a time. He
also called our place "The Great Appalachian Park and Forest Reserve,"
before we had thought about our national parks. He liked to keep things
beautiful.
My mother was always busy helping with the canning, drying fruit, and
cooking of course. And in those days we had the privilege of churning, mak-
ing butter in the old-fashioned churn with a dasher. She would sit there
churning, and she wouldn't waste her time—she would read to us while
she was churning. My first acquaintance with Dickens and Shakespeare
and Scott were her readings to us.
Then she would make us stockings—knit them. She would knit away and
read at the same time. In our living room, up overhead, there were four
hooks in the ceiling for quilting frames. She'd cut the pieces for the quilts
and do the quilting, and all sorts of things to help make things go.
They would have preaching at the school on Sundays. The Baptist
preacher would come and preach. My brother, Ralph, was quite a mimic
and after we would get home, he would gather the rest of us children up at
the edge of the woods and preach us a sermon going through the motions
that the old man with his bandana handkerchief would go through at the
service.
My parents both belonged to the Episcopal Church. They wouldn't stay
away from the church of their inheritance, and it wasn't long before we
started services there in Murphy. My father was what they call a lay reader.
He started the services in a room above a furniture store with a piano box
serving as an altar. My mother was the organist and Sunday school teacher.
My father conducted the services except one Sunday a month when a man
would come out from Asheville and hold services for us. So we shifted from
the country log school to the school in town and from services in the log
schoolhouse to the room above the furniture store in town.
We had some neighbors in our community—colored people—who had
no religious instruction at all. Sometimes they'd be working for my mother
and begin asking questions and she would teach them. Very often she would
gather them on Sundays onto our back porch and she'd have a Sunday
school for them. Later, somebody enabled her to buy a little log cabin near
our house which she used for a Sunday school for the colored people.
My grandmother Siler had been a Chipman before her marriage, and she
was born in New York State of Canadian stock. She was brought up as a
member of the Church of England in Canada—that's the same as the Epis-
copal Church in the United States. She had a half sister who had married

============================================================

and had come down to Murphy, North Carolina. My grandmother came
down to visit her, and she met my grandfather. He lived over here in "this
valley. He was born just across the valley over here. She stuck to her Epis-
copal Church, although there wasn't one here. The nearest one was over in
Waynesville, forty miles away. When there were children to be baptized,
she would take them over there. Then she let the Bishop know that she was
here and a member of the Church, and that she wanted to keep her contact
with the Church. So the Bishop would call that to the attention of any
ministers passing through, and they would come by to see her and give her
the service.
In 1877, a minister finally came, Reverend John Archibald Deal. There
wasn't any parsonage, so Reverend and Mrs. Deal lived with my grand-
parents, and I'm pretty sure that it was in this house in which we sit. My
grandparents had gone to housekeeping in a log house just a few hundred
yards from here—one of the old-fashioned log houses with two rooms under
one roof with what was called then a dog-trot, an open space in between
the rooms. But I'm pretty sure it was in this house that the minister and his
wife lived with my grandparents.
So after Reverend Deal came, he began immediately to make plans for
building a church, and it was the first St. John's Church here that he built.
The land was given by my grandparents, and with the help of money that
he was able to get, as he said, from the North (I think he came originally
from Connecticut) and from what gifts he could get here, contributions of
materials and labor, they built the church. According to his record, my
mother was one of the chief contributors to the building of the church. She
was just out of prep school but at that age and at that time, she gave one
hundred dollars toward the building of the church, which was quite a sum
for a school girl, and she fed the carpenters while they were building the
church.
While the church was being built, there was an incident that is brought
to my attention every time I think of St. John's Church. There is a marker
up there at a double grave for Chief Chuttahsotee and his wife Cunstagih—
I told you earlier about their escaping from the Trail of Tears and coming
back to my great-grandparents' home. My grandfather visited them, read
the Scriptures to them, offered prayers and sang hymns to the old man.
While the new church was being built, the old chief died. He had requested
to my grandfather that he be buried with the white man's burial. So, since
my grandfather was giving the land to the church, he had him buried there.
And the chief's wife, Cunstagih, died the next day. She wasn't sick, just
passed. So she was buried there with her husband. I am always proud of my
family's participation in that episode. Their graves are the most prominent
in the St. John's Cemetery. They have a large stone for a grave marker. We

were friends of the Indians. Occasionally, not as often as I'd like, I come
in contact with their great-granddaughter and great-great-grandchildren
over there at Cherokee.
After St. John's was built, the Episcopal church just nine miles over in
Franklin was started, then one in Highlands, one in Cullowhee, all over the
place, because Reverend Deal was a very missionary-minded man. Another
thing that he did during the expansion of his work was to establish a small
church between here and Franklin for the colored people. There weren't
very many of them here, but he was a very practical man, and he built the
church for worship, but also developed work for crafts, cabinetmaking and
so forth. I used to minister to that congregation, and last Sunday I had
some visitors. After our service at St. John's, we were out there on the porch
and a pickup truck turned into the drive. This man came up with a bundle
in his hand. He was a member of that colored congregation. While I had

charge of the church down there, he loved rabbit hunting, and would very
often give me a rabbit he had killed, so that was what he had. He had a
rabbit that he wanted me to have that he had had in the deep-freeze, and
then his mother-in-law had made some jelly and pickles, and she had sent
that to me. I keep that contact. When their minister happens to be away, I
go down still and hold service for them. The man who came up from Co-
lumbia, South Carolina, to teach cahinetmaking built various things for the
church, including a baptismal font for St. John's. He got inspired to go into
the ministry and he told me—he was a very young man when he came here
—that he studied under Reverend Deal for twenty-three years before he
could get far enough along to be ordained for the ministry in the church,
and he worked in and for the church until his death just a few years ago.
The time came when I wanted to go off to school, because at a very early
age I determined I wanted to be a minister, I guess largely under the
influence of my mother. She probably influenced me more than anyone else.
We shared appreciation of flowers, beauties of nature, that sort of thing, a
very great deal. I admired her for her devotion to the church in so many
ways. She played the organ; she taught Sunday school. She let me know
very early in my life that she would like very much for me to go into the
ministry. She told me about a prayer when I was sick with typhoid fever
and the doctors didn't expect me to live. She gave herself to prayer in addi-
tion to her ministry to me physically, and she said that if God would spare
me, she would do what she could to give me to God's service, and that had
a real influence on me.
We didn't have any high school over there then, so I tried to find some
high school that I could attend by working my way. There was probably a
year in between. For a few months I went up to Andrews, the next town in
the county. I did the chores—building fires, chopping wood, whatever came
handy, milking cows—for my board. I still remember the whistle of the
local tannery before daylight. That was a sign to get up and do the chores
before school. And then I also went to a school at Micadale, a church
school outside of Waynesville, and lived in the home of the local minister
who had several scattered churches, and I did the chores there for my
board. My oldest sister was teaching in this school. She wasn't so much
older than I but she had gone to a preparatory school operated by our Aunt
Lucy down at Hickory, so she was ahead of me more than her years would
indicate. And then those schools didn't prepare me to go very far. I went to
the Waynesville High School, a public school. One year I boarded with the
local Episcopal minister and looked after the church, sweeping it, building
the fires, mowing the lawn, whatever came up. And another year, I
boarded with the same sort of arrangement, with a Mr. Thomas, and did

the milking, and the fire building and other chores around the place. Dur-
ing the summer I would get whatever job I could—driving a team some-
times to haul material for paving the main street in Waynesville.
Some things follow you in life. James Thomas, the man with whose fam-
ily I was staying that winter, was a descendant of Bill Thomas, who was a
white man but adopted by a Cherokee Indian chief, so he was always inter-
ested in the Indians' plight. When the government hunted out all the Cher-
okees they could catch from these mountains, they finally gave up and just
had to let the rest of them go. Later, Bill Thomas asked permission to get
from the Indians the little bit of money the government had allowed them
for taking over their property, to buy a tract of land to settle these Indians
on. The government gave him permission and so we have what is called the
Indian Reservation of the Eastern Band of the Cherokees, which authorities
say isn't technically a reservation because it is owned outright by the tribe of
the eastern band.
Anyway, I stayed with this family and a baby was born to the Thomas
family. The mother was a staunch Episcopalian, and she asked me to stand
as sponsor, godfather, of this baby, Sarah. I still keep in touch with Sarah
who lives in Waynesville. She is Sarah Thomas Campbell, Mrs. Roy Camp-
bell. She has a niece who lives with her, Sarah Jo Thomas. They're both
very dear people, both very devoted to the church and active, and Sarah Jo
is interested in our summer conference ground at Kanuga Lake. She's espe-
cially interested in an open-air chapel there that I had a hand in building
down by a stream with a stone altar. Some of my hiking friends gave the
money to construct that chapel. We call it the Chapel of St. Francis of
Assisi. My daughter was married there. I performed the ceremony in that
little woodland chapel. That friendship with the Thomases has continued to
be very dear to me.
I enjoyed those years and did better than I expected to in school. When it
came to the year of graduation, which I think was through the tenth year,
rather to my surprise I had an average for the two years I was there of
ninety-nine. It was the only creditable grade I ever made. And, of course,
being the highest grade in the class, I was valedictorian. I remember one
event that rather embarrassed me at the time. I prepared my valedictory
speech and then I had to practice it. I wanted to hear what it sounded like,
and I couldn't very well practice in the home where I was staying, so over
across the creek that runs through the town there's a ridge, and I went over
there to practice saying my speech. One evening I was over there on the
side of the ridge and I heard voices down below. I wondered who was there
and what they were coming up there for, so I waited. They called and I an-
swered, and they came on up. I found it was some folks who had a feeble-
minded son who would get out and yell and call, and they thought I was

he. I think they were somewhat dismayed that I was out there in the twi-
light saying my speech.
While I was there, I had a little practice in church work and Sunday
school teaching, and then I became what we call in our church a lay reader.
The folks in the church there at WaynesviUe thought that I could help out,
so although I was just a high-school boy, I got a license as a lay reader.
Most of my work, besides Sunday school, was holding service in the Negro
church over on the other side of town. I enjoyed that very much. I always
had a liking for people of other races, whether Negroes or Indians or
whomever.
I remember once the minister got me to go over from there to Cullowhee
to hold service in the St. David's Church. The principal member in the
church was old Colonel Davies, who was a Welshman. I went over and
held service and the old colonel was also a lay reader, and he wrote to the
minister in WaynesviUe telling him that he didn't think it was necessary for
the minister to send that high-school boy to hold services—that he could
hold services just as well and save the trouble.
Well, I graduated there in 1906, and that summer I got a job with a
lumber mill, Soco Flume Company over on Soco Creek on the Indian reser-
vation.
Then I went, contrary to the expectation of some of my friends, to
Chapel Hill. They thought I would go to Sewanee, University of the
South, which is a church college. But I thought since I was planning to be a
minister, I ought to have experience with people who are not church-con-
nected and who are not planning to go into the ministry, so I went into the
University of North Carolina.
I found it very difficult there for two reasons: The sort of high school
that WaynesviUe had didn't prepare a man for college and so I had to make
up almost a year during my freshman year, and then I had to earn my way.
I found that more difficult than it had been in high school, but with what
work I could get, sweeping up buildings and tending fires and acting as sex-
ton to the church, I managed to get through with the help of summer work.
One summer while I was there, 1909, the Bishop asked me to go to Can-
ton, a paper-mill town, and start a Sunday school there. Because we had no
church there and no church building, we rented a tent and called it the St.
Andrews Tent Sunday School. Later on the church was built there and they
took that same name.
In that and various other ways, I got jobs that just barely made me
enough to eat, but I enjoyed that. Lately I've been interested in all these
talks about the comet [Kahoutek]. It was during my senior year, spring of
that year, that Halley's Comet appeared. It was very much more easily vlsi-

ble than the one that was supposed to have come across this past winter. I
can remember watching it.
Part of my work there at Chapel Hill was looking after the church. I
would build the fires and sweep out and ring the bell. One morning I was
feeling down in spirits and I needed the communion service—at least I felt
I did and I still think I did—which was to be at 7:30 in the morning. I
rang the first bell thirty minutes before the service was supposed to start;
then I rang the second bell just five minutes before and the minister wasn't
there yet. In a few minutes he came rushing in, saying he had slept late.
Nobody else came to the service. He said, "Well, since there's nobody else
here, we just won't have a service this time."
That was a terrible disappointment to me, and I've thought of that a
great many times when there were just perhaps one or two or three for an
early communion. I've been very much pleased to go ahead with the service
if there was just one.
Well, I graduated from there in spite of the hardships. That was the
hardest period of my education. Then I considered the matter of seminary
and university work, and again I wanted to go somewhere beside my own
local habitat. I decided to go the seminary in New York City, General The-
ological Seminary. I don't approve of what the arrangement was there en-
tirely, but it helped me very much. In the churches there in New York City,
they get so hard up for qualified Sunday school teachers, they'll pay semi-
nary students for teaching or acting as secretary or doing social work in the
church, and so besides the scholarship I got at the seminary, I got paid for
that sort of thing—at Trinity Chapel up on 25th Street, the Chapel of the
Incarnation down on 14th Street, sometimes over in New Jersey across the
river, and various places.
I got along very well, not making any outstanding marks but I enjoyed it.
I played handball at the gym we had there. I played basketball, but I didn't
get along very well there because I didn't know much about it and I was
too rough, I guess, for the authorities. I got penalized quite often at it, but I
did enjoy it.
While I was there, there was a mutual arrangement (and still is) be-
tween Columbia University and the seminary. Seminary is way downtown,
20th Street and Ninth Avenue; Columbia is up on Morningside Heights. I
had to go by elevated train back and forth. I studied there as much as I did
at the seminary. The course at the seminary is three years, but at the end of
that time, I managed to get a fellowship at the seminary and I was or-
dained deacon that spring, 1913, and I got a job during that fellowship
year at a small church right near the seminary as assistant rector at St.
Peter's Church. I had a very pleasant year there. I enjoyed the contacts. I

lived at the seminary—one of my classmates also got a fellowship and we
roomed together. The building was four stories high and no elevators. The
rooms were in groups—two bedrooms and a living room. The heat was
from a grate and the coal was in the basement and we had to carry it up
four flights of stairs. But we did have maids who looked after our rooms. I
had some complaints by the maid to the seminary authorities that she just
couldn't look after my room, because I just froze her out. I'd leave my win-
dows open. She didn't like that especially. The shower baths were in the
basement, too. I'd go down there and take a shower the first thing in the
morning and by the time I got out and back up to my room, there were ici-
cles on my hair.
The minister with whom I lived one year when I was at Waynesvillc had
gone back to his native state of Vermont. He had a church up there in
Swanton, Vermont. He invited me to come up and help him for the sum-
mer, 1912, while I was still at seminary. I went up and helped with the
Sunday school, painted the church roof, various other things. Then I dis-
covered that it was just out of the kindness of his heart that he had invited
me to come up. He didn't have enough work for me. So I got a job in the
marble mill down by the Missisquoi River, and I worked there in the draft-
ing room practically all summer. I enjoyed getting down to the river, and
then sometimes out on to Lake Champlain in a canoe after work was over.
I'd take a sandwich along and share it with the mosquitoes, of which there
were plenty.
So I worked there until nearly time to go back to the seminary. When I
told the mill authorities, they offered me a permanent job in the mill at a
salary of more than I received for the first several years in the ministry.
The winter before, I had met a young lady in New York. Her family had
a summer home up above Gloversville, New York, and we thought we were
pretty much in love. Her family invited me to come by on my way back to
New York City and make them a visit in their summer home. I went, going
down through Lake Champlain, Lake George—a beautiful trip. We got to
talking things over and her mother didn't like the idea of her daughter mar-
rying a minister. Her mother was something of a climber, and so she talked
with me and with her daughter. She said, "I won't allow it, unless Rufus
will promise to do all that he can to get the best position that he can in the
ministry." Well, that's not my idea of the ministry. She would like to have
had me a bishop or something of the sort, and I wasn't about to do it. So
the young lady said, "Well, whatever Mother says, I have tc do."
I said, "Well, if that's the way you feel about it, it's all over as far as I m
concerned."
So I went next morning down to Gloversville which is above Albany,
bought a frying pan and a blanket, almost nothing else, and started out

walking it off. I walked from there to Boston, two hundred and seventeen
miles, sleeping out at night, averaging more than forty miles a day. I got to
the outskirts of Boston and found a restaurant and got supper. I had walked
forty-three miles that day. Then, when I had satisfied my hunger, I went
out and looked for a policeman to inquire the way to the nearest "Y." He
gave me directions and then as I started off, he noticed that I was a little bit
stiff, and he said, "Look here, fella." I stopped. He said, "Have you got
money enough to get out of here on?"
I told him I thought I had. I still tease some of my Boston friends about
their trying to run me out of town the only time I was ever there. So I
toured Boston that day on a sightseeing bus and that night I took the boat,
the Fall River Line down to New York, back to the seminary.
I was studying at Columbia University aiming for a Ph.D. in Political
Science. I met most of the requirements, but I had never studied German. I
had taken a lot of French and Latin and Greek and Hebrew—never good
at any of them—but I had never had any German. My sister Lucy had
been at the Deaconess School on the Cathedral grounds there near Columbia
University and I was in and out there, and she or somebody told me there
was one of the students there who had studied German, lived in Germany
for several years, and she heard that I needed German and she volunteered
to help me. That broke up my doctorate, and I married her instead of
learning any German to amount to anything. I never did get my Ph.D.
Later, the seminary there awarded me an honorary STD [Doctor of Sacred
Theology], which is the only one that I ever received.
The school at Penland was my interest when I started out in the ministry.
While I was still in the seminary studying for the ministry, the man who
was bishop over this section of North Carolina talked over what I wanted to
do, and I told him I wanted to come back to the mountains to do what I
could here. He gave me a choice. The Episcopal Church had a school
founded in 1842, Valle Crucis, in what is now Watauga County. It was first
started as a training school for ministers who wanted to go to work in the
rural sections, especially in the mountains. Later, it was changed into a
hoarding school for mountain girls that would train them as they would like
to be trained, but who didn't have money enough to go off to school. The
church owned quite a large tract of land there, several hundred acres, and
the school was started and the Bishop was interested in it. He got people to
come in to teach them, not only the academic subjects, but various indus-
tries. He established at one time, a dairy, including a cheese factory. He
used part of it for some time as a poultry farm. He planted apple trees and
raised apples commercially. Before industries came in and before electricity
was brought in, he had erected a power plant for the immediate community.

============================================================

His sister there was in charge of the school locally, but he wanted a minister
there.
He offered me the choice of that position in this old established school or
a farm at Penland where a man had tried to establish a school for mountain
youth and had failed to make a go of it. He had just planted some apple
trees on it because the one at Valle Crucis had done so well.
I chose Penland because it was virgin territory so far as the Episcopal
Church was concerned, and I could determine the policy of it. I had been
at Valle Crucis one summer studying, intending to write my Ph.D. thesis
on that community, and one phase of the work there really distressed me.
That was the "old clothes room" where people from the cities would send
their old garments to be given or sold to the people—the so-called poor
mountain whites. I didn't like that approach. I preferred the idea of train-
ing the mountain people in things that they could make a living at them-
selves and give them a sense of dignity.
There have always been those who have laughed at the idea of helping
mountain people become economically self-sufficient. You probably know
that President Theodore Roosevelt appointed a commission to study the
Southern Appalachians, and they made a report on the conditions and some
of the things that ought to be done, like preserving the forests. Most of those
things were good, I thought. There was one man on the commission that
disagreed with the findings of the majority and resigned. He wrote a book
entitled Child That Toileth Not. Fm quite sure that that book is out of ex-
istence at the present time. I don't remember the man's name. I was in the
seminary at the time and a friend of mine who was studying art was com-
missioned to paint a picture for the cover of the book. The author's point
was that he thought this was no place for people to live, and he urged that
the population of the southern mountains be moved down to the cotton
mills where they could find labor and enough to eat. Well, I thought of
course that it ought to be gone about in a different way.
People said, "Well, they have the mills down south. The mills can make
the cloth and other products much faster than people can make them by
hand, so it would never pay to develop the old crafts and teach the people."
Even some of our church authorities were perfectly willing to ask the people
in the cities to send old clothes and that sort of thing to help these "poor
mountain whites." Help them out in that way and give them charity, so-
called, but not help them become less dependent. They took that stand
when my sister Lucy and I conceived the idea of developing the crafts at
Penland.
I was always more in favor of the approval of men like John C. Camp-
bell, who was a Presbyterian minister. The leaders in education, public
health, crafts, recreation got together beginning back in 1913 under the

============================================================

419
leadership then of Dr. Campbell and explored through this mountain sec-
tion to see what the needs really were. And Dr. Campbell envisioned the
John C. Campbell Folk School at Brasstown. Unfortunately he died before
it was actually put on the map, but his wife, Olive Dame Campbell, went
ahead and with others who worked with her, established the school [still in
existence today]. Meanwhile, Dr. Campbell organized what was called then
the Mountain Workers' Conference. It met in 1913 in Atlanta. I was still in
seminary. But the next year it met in Knoxville, and I met with them then
and was a member and often a member of the board—one time chairman
of the board—until after the Second World War, and that organization put
out several reports on health, education, and religion.
Another significant thing that came out of that council was and is the
Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild. They laid stress on quality work of
handicrafts throughout the mountains. And they've established shops for
handling the crafts. They have certain requirements for members. Sally
Kesler is a member and John Bulgin down in Franklin is one in wrought
iron. There are quite a number. The Guild has prospered. You'll find shops
throughout the mountains that handle the products of these members of the
Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild. [Their annual fairs in the summer
in Asheville and the fall in Knoxville are the most popular, well-attended
crafts fairs in the mountains.]
From that angle, the mountains are coming into their own, that is reviv-
ing the things that are their heritage here in the mountains.
So, as I said, I chose Penland and called it the Appalachian Industrial
School. I spent the summer of 1913 there, although I was going back for
further study at the seminary and Columbia University; then I came back
spring of 1914. I fixed up an old log house there quite comfortably—it was
just a plain cabin. Then there was an old farmhouse on the place, and I
made it over into a school building with space for a couple of teachers to
live and the classrooms. During that first year or two, we did what we could
to put in plumbing. There wasn't any electricity then. We bought a site
down on the Toe River, intending to put in a power plant for ourselves and
the community.
We started in giving the first students, who were boys, a chance to work
there on the farm—working in the orchard, helping with the plumbing,
Putting in a pumping station for the water, pumping it up to the buildings.
We put up a building we called Ridgeway Hall, and then put up a simple,
but more suitable, building for a family than the log cabin. Later on, it was
used as a dormitory, and the people who followed me named it Morgan
Hall. Instead of continuing, as I had planned it, a school for boarding pu-
pils, learning farming, orchardry, so forth, they discovered there was a
greater need for smaller children from broken homes, and so it was run by

FOXFIRE 4
Mr. Peter Lambert for a number of years. Then the church felt that the
public schools and orphanages were adequate to take care of that type of
work, so this was discontinued.
All the time I was planning with my sister Lucy to put in crafts, reviving
the old hand weaving, spinning, basketmaking—teaching the women of the
community these arts so they could earn money for things they needed in
their homes—to give them a greater feeling of worth. But after I had been
there for four years, I felt that I would have to leave Penland. The Bishop
wanted me to travel, raising funds and begging money, going to Phila-
delphia and New York and other cities in the North. There were others
doing the same kind of thing, and I was having to follow them. I didn't ap-
preciate the methods some people used, and I felt that I couldn't do this.
Penland continued with Lucy heading it up. She had already taken some
training in Chicago in weaving from a Mr. Worst. Later he came down to
Penland to help her set up additional weaving classes. Then she got a lady,

============================================================
PAGE 418
============================================================

REV. A. RUFUS MORGAN 
421
one of the few original people who is still there, to do the spinning and
weaving, and she trained the local women in some of the crafts. They were
then able to do things that they couldn't do otherwise—improve their
houses, make curtains for their homes, give their children dental work, and
do all sorts of things that made life somewhat better. One of the first things
that she did was to have a log raising where the men came in and brought
logs to make this log house for the weaving and spinning, and basketmaking
and other crafts. Then she worked valiantly replacing one building that was
on the property that had burned down, and erected a stone building that
they called "The Pines." Then the men helped build a larger log building
that is still used, and the women helped by feeding them.
They have a number of buildings now. Instead of remaining as a com-
munity project which she intended it to be, people began coming to take
training from outside. They'd learned about the school because Lucy had to
market things that were made there in order to purchase the materials and
run the school. She attended the general church convention, which meets
once every three years, in New Orleans in 1925, and took some of the ma-
terials, articles that had been woven. I was a delegate to that convention so
I went down and helped her all I could in the marketing. After that, she
went to various other conventions and people got acquainted with what
Penland was doing until, before she retired, people were coming from forty-
eight different countries besides all over the United States, some to learn the
crafts and some to teach. From the Scandinavian countries, she got several
teachers. [The Penland School is still operating today in Penland, North
Carolina.]
I went down to South Carolina and ministered to three small churches in
neighboring towns for a couple of years. During that time, there was the flu
epidemic of the First World War.
1 hat was 1918 and I was thirty-three years old. I lived in the little town
of Barnwell, a characteristic lower South Carolina town. Sherman had
come through during the War Between the States. He used the Episcopal
church to stable his horses. I also had churches in a little town south of that,
much newer, Allendale, and another town about the same distance, fifteen
miles maybe. Each one had its points of interest. They were the old South
Carolina type of communities. There in Barnwell, soon after I came, I was
to have an evening service. I went down to the church and rang the first
bell half an hour before service, turned on the lights, got ready, and five
minnutes before the service rang another bell, and nobody came. Well, I am
rather a crank, I guess, about promptness, so I waited about fifteen minutes
after the time for the service—no congregation. So I just turned off the
lights, closed the door, and went on up the street. I met a group of the con-

FOXFIRE 4
gregation. "Why, Mr. Morgan, what's the matter? Not going to have any
service?"'
I said, "I intended to, but there wasn't anybody there at service time."
"Well, we were going to church, and thought we had plenty of time."
So I went back and held the service. After that, they were prompt.
One thing that interested me there, because that's low country with
sandy soil. They don't have clay the way we do here. Instead of just digging
a grave for a funeral, they dig it and then a brick mason builds up the walls
of the grave for fear it will cave in. Then after the casket is in place and the
service over, he builds an arch above it, so that it is encased in brick. That
was quite new to me, of course.
The school authorities where I was living in Barnwell were without a
principal for the high school. They asked me to pinch hit for them. I said,
"Well, provided you get a man just as soon as possible." For the whole year,
they didn't find anybody else. Workers were scarce. So I did church work
and the school work together, and during the flu epidemic I ministered
through the Red Cross and saw more people die, I think, that year than I
have in all the rest of my life. I ministered to the people out in the country
and in the town, and then to the chain-gang Negroes, who lived in metal
vans. I couldn't see why they didn't freeze to death.
I went from there to Chester, South Carolina, a mill town, and was there
for six years. Then I went to Columbia [South Carolina], and there I was
executive secretary and general missionary for the diocese of upper South
Carolina. I visited churches that had been closed or without a minister and
did various things—reorganizing congregations, etc. After five years of that,
I became rector of St. John's Church there in Columbia. I enjoyed ten
years there. They had a comparatively new stone church and were still in
debt, and the vestry wanted me to jump right in to raising money to pay the
debt on the church and on the pipe organ. I said, "Are they pressing us for
the debt?"
"Well, not exactly. There it is and we're paying interest on it."
I said, "As I understood it, you called me here as your spiritual leader,
and that's what I propose to try to be. If we take care of the spiritual life,
the money part will take care of itself."
So we went ahead and built up the work in the Sunday school and the
congregation. I spent ten very pleasant years there.
One thing that I remember with a great deal of pleasure was that I did
some planting around the churchyard. There were some great stones that
had been left over from building the church and I managed, with some
help, to get them arranged in a circle serving as seats, and very often we'd
have our young people's meetings there in that circle. I planted some roses
back of the seats and later, after I had left, they put up a parish house right

============================================================

423
where that circle was. Some of my friends who were interested in flowers
and gardening rescued one of the roses, took it home, and when they had an
opportunity, they gave it to me, and it's growing out here in front of my
porch. I planted another rose there next to the church, and I have started
cuttings from it and have them growing here. Another thing that I did—
those of us who were interested in flowers and trees formed a dogwood gar-
den club and we planted dogwood trees along many of the streets and there
at the church.
During the time that I was there, I served also as business manager for
our summer conference grounds, Kanuga Lake outside of Hendersonville. I
had had no experience in that sort of thing, but somehow we worked it out.
I had had young people's camps for the Church in various other places be-
fore we took over Kanuga Lake on an option. We tried it in 1928, and liked
it well enough and were able to raise enough money to purchase the build-
ings and a twenty-five-acre lake and four hundred acres of land. Fortunately
we had a good dietician and other help. That first summer there were heavy
rains and they washed out the dam to the lake. We had to have that rebuilt.
I've kept in contact with many of the boys and girls. Some of the men
have gone into the ministry; one or two have become bishops. It renovated
the life of the youth of the Church in the Carolinas, especially. Some came
from other states.
We would spend summers there at Kanuga, except I would go back
down to hold services at St. John's Church. All that time I was homesick
for the mountains, and the work in this section here had gone down terribly.
I heard the minister at St. Agnes Church in Franklin was leaving, so I got in
touch with the Bishop and I came up to take charge of the work.
The first day of November 1940, a very significant day in our church cal-
endar, All-Saints Day, was the day I returned to Franklin and Macon
County, North Carolina.
The work in this section had gone down, mostly through neglect in our
church and in some of the others. We treat the country work as a stepchild,
do not support it, do not send good men, so some of the churches that our
first ministry here in this area had established had been abandoned, some of
them torn down. I wanted to begin to get them on their feet so I could re-
establish them or establish new ones. Bishop Gribbin told me, when he
asked me to come, to take charge of the church in Franklin, St. Agnes, and
the Church of the Transfiguration in Highlands, and temporarily hold serv-
ices over at Murphy. Well, that's a stretch—from Highlands to Murphy—
of about eighty miles. So I started in with that and then I saw other needs.
The man who was conducting service at the colored church, St. Cyp-
rians, lived in Asheville and came over to Franklin once a month. I asked
them if they wouldn't like to have service every Sunday, and I gave them

services. The church in Sylva was being neglected, so I called it to the atten-
tion of the Bishop. The next year, 1941, the minister who had been serving
it from Waynesville resigned and went to Florida. So the Bishop said, "You
see what you can do with it."
So I took charge of it. They had no minister and the church had been
closed at Cullowhee, so I went over there and for the time being, as the
church wasn't suitable to have service, I held services when I could at the
Student Union. Then I had some funds that people had given me when I
left Columbia, and I spent about four hundred dollars just patching things
up so that the building wouldn't deteriorate. Later I got the women of the
national church to give me ten thousand dollars to renovate the church and
add a wing for students' activities and meetings.
Then I discovered that the Episcopal Church never had a service over at
Cherokee, and since my people had always been friendly with the Indians, I
started going over there and finally built the church from other gifts from
the women of the church amounting to twenty thousand dollars.
I built another church over at Murphy, a colored church, and started a
little congregation which has been abandoned since over at Andrews. I
knew that I couldn't do an adequate job, but I wanted to start things going,
and there are six of us working now in that same territory—eleven churches
that I had charge of when I had to retire.
I think I started to tell you about my present love which has been my
love ever since I was born—St. John's at Cartoogechaye.
The first Episcopal minister came to Cartoogechaye in 1877. At the urg-
ing of my grandmother, the Bishop sent him. He came without anything
tangible to work with or to work on. He and his wife lived with my grand-
parents until he could get a log house built about a mile from here. That's
right across from where St. John's Church stands. The stipend, or salary, in
those days was very, very small. He would teach in the subscription schools
—that is, people would send small sums to send their children. He would
teach during the week, then minister on Sundays. The first church that he
undertook to build was right across from where he lived in his log house.
My grandparents gave the land, two acres, and according to his records, my
mother was a contributor. That was the beginning of Reverend Deal's
work. He says in the preface of the book, Parish Register, that he went
North to get money to help build the original St. John's. He came in 1877
and he built the church about 1879. The first wedding that was performed
in the church was that of my father, Alfred Morgan and my mother, Fanny
Siler, according to the records. My parents were married in 1881 and my
oldest sister was born in my grandparents' house in 1882, and then I was
born there, in 1885. I was baptized in the church.
It was only about six years later that my family moved over the mountain

to Cherokee County. I remember that quite well. As far as St. John's was
concerned, it went along fairly smoothly until that first minister, Deal, re-
tired about 1909. There is no further record of services there, but the con-
gregation went down through neglect, mostly. I can't find out just how
long the church stood. After the building was torn down, the place was
neglected, and the people who had loved ones buried there—most of
them—moved the graves. There were a few left, those of Chuttahsotee and
his wife, Cunstagih, and my mother's grave and two infants', and Mr. and
Mrs. Gillespie, Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, and just one or two others. People
supposed that the church grounds would go back into wilderness and that
would be that.
While I was living in South Carolina, I heard that the church authorities
were planning to sell the land where the church had been. I wrote to them
and asked them to please not sell it, but if they did, to give me the chance of
buying it because, when the. graves were moved, some of our relatives
wanted to move my mother's grave and the two infants, and I protested, so
they didn't. I started whenever I could on vacations, before I moved up
here, clearing out the underbrush and dreaming of building a church back.
Just by raking and scraping, getting up what materials I could, I started the
building and we held our first services there in 1945. I had moved back in
1940. We have continued since with just a handful. Last Sunday, for in-
stance, we had seven in the congregation. Sometime in the summertime,
there will be twenty-five or thirty. The church, with crowding in, will hold
about forty-five people.
I had to retire from the other churches officially when I was seventy-two,
because that's our age limit in the Episcopal Church. So that's been my
only charge since that time—from seventy-two to eighty-nine. I say my only
charge because there is another little chapel that we've finally built, nine
miles beyond St. John's, in Rainbow Springs. I'd been holding services in
the remnant of an old schoolhouse, one room, and then the people over
there, the few of them, wanted a church. We had no money for it until
1962. We got together enough stone and started building just a very small
chapel, which is an open air chapel—no walls to it—just a stone floor and
stone altar, with locust posts to hold up the roof. The wall around the floor
is high enough to sit on. During the summertime, we hold services up there,
from May to October. That cost only a little over a thousand dollars to
build, but I took that out of the offerings that St. John's had given.
In regard to money, St. John's is unique in the way of a church. We do
not take up collections as they do in most churches, except when the Bishop
is here. We always give to the Bishop, for his discretionary fund, the offer-
ings when he is here; so in order to have it, we pass the plate. Otherwise, we
just put a handmade pewter plate on the organ and those who know our

custom and want to put in something put it in after the service. So there's
enough to take care of our expenses and to make a missionary donation to
the Church. I do not and never have had a stipend or a salary [from St.
John's].
As I grew older, I realized that I couldn't be on hand there many more
years, and I began to think about what would happen to St. John's after I
died, or became disabled. So 1 got a lawyer, relative of mine, to incorporate
the St. John's Nonah Foundation, in order to start a fund and make it grow
as fast as possible for a background fund to help look after somebody who
would volunteer to do the same thing I've done—just to serve in a volun-
tary capacity to hold services up there after I'm gone. Well, the principal of
that fund, like the cemetery fund, is not to be spent. Only the interest. And
since it is for the continuance of the work after I die, even the interest is not
to be spent until I have to give up.
Not long ago, a member of the church died who had been very faithful.
She and her husband had volunteered to clean the church every little while,
to repair the cushions, do various jobs that they saw needed to be done, and
then after a while, she brought her tape recorder to the church and
recorded the services. After her death, we received several gifts from five to
twenty-five dollars in her memory for this fund. I have a friend down in
South Carolina who, when she has a friend who dies, instead of sending
flowers, sends a small check in memory of the friend for that fund. So it's
slowly growing. If we get a gift not designated for anything special, we just
add it to the fund.
The present church has been used about the same length of time that the
old church was used. In the record for the old church, there were eight wed-
dings recorded. Recently, I performed the forty-first wedding in the present
church.
There are various things that are of interest to me. One is that a few
years ago, I realized that people in my family would wonder what kind of
marker to put at my grave, so I decided to make that decision for them. I
got a lovely stone back in the mountains, got the monument man to put the
lettering on it and to erect the stone where I want to be buried.
There are some boxwoods on the church grounds, some of them were
given by a couple for whom I performed a wedding ceremony—one of the
oldest couples that I've served in that way. The man was seventy-five when
he got married to his second wife. Others were given by a family for whom
I performed the marriage ceremony for their daughter. They do not belong
to the Episcopal Church—one is Presbyterian, the other Roman Catholic—
but they were doing some work around their place and they had some Eng-
lish boxwoods, and they asked me if we could use them at the church and I
did. Besides that, I had done various plantings- bulbs, amaryllis, pink dog-

woods that somebody gave me, hydrangeas, and then where I needed a
break by a hedge, I planted one little hedge of white pines and another of
Canadian hemlocks. Then I planted some rhododendrons and various other
plants. We left quite a number of trees around the church, because I don't
like the barren look of a bulldozed lawn. That's one thing that has attracted
people to decide that they want to be buried there.
We try to minister to people no matter what church they belong to. We
have people buried here who arc Baptists, Roman Catholics, Presbyterians,
Christian Scientists, whatever, but before they die, we try to minister to
them, too. Sometimes we have groups who come in there who are on a re-
treat asking my permission for meditatioas, and sometimes they request that
I give them a holy communion service, and I do. I don't question to what
church they belong. I am just happy that I can minister to them in any
spiritual way. That has been my interest so far as the church is concerned
here in these latter years.
I am quite handicapped. I've got to the point where I can hardly read at
all unless I use a very strong lens, so I read the portions of Scripture over
and over again through the week to memorize the passage, and then I'm
ready on Sunday to conduct the service. Sometimes I get what we call a lay
reader, and he will help to read the lessons or the songs in a service. I can't
memorize all the songs, so when I lead them, I choose some of the shorter
ones that I have memorized in times past. I hold services there twice most
Sundays—Communion at 8:00 Sunday morning and Morning Prayer, or
Litany, at 11:00, and then in the summertime a third service at 4:00 in the
afternoon in the Chapel of the Ascension up on the mountain. Naturally, I
can't tell how long I can continue, but I am on the lookout for somebody
who, after he retires from the active ministry, will take over on the same
basis that I've been carrying on these last few years.
I haven't mentioned a couple of things that gratified me. One is that sev-
eral years ago, maybe twenty-five years ago, I was chosen as the rural pastor
of the year for the state of North Carolina. This was not denominational
but out of the whole bunch, and that pleased me.
And after I'd been out of the seminary for thirty years, the General The-
ological Seminary, from which I graduated, awarded me the honorary de-
gree of Doctor of Sacred Theology, and that's the reason that a good many
people call me "Doctor."
But many of those who knew me before I received the doctor's degree
just call me Mr. Morgan. Some of them have the habit of calling me Uncle
Rufus, or if they are approaching my age, of course they call me Rufus, so I
come to any of the calls. Some people call me other things that I do not like
so well. Some call me Preacher Morgan, and that seems to indicate that a
minister doesn't do anything but get up and preach once a week. I think a

============================================================

minister's duty is much more than that. Some people call me Father Mor-
gan and I don't like that because Christ somewhere said, "Let no man call
thee Father. You have one Father, Who is in Heaven." But in certain areas
of our church, the ministers encourage people to call them "Father," Father
Smith, Father Jones, etc., because they like the formality of it, the distinc-
tion of it—the old idea of the Middle Ages of "father confessor," but I
don't like it. Christ's reason, as I gather it from the Scripture, gave instruc-
tions to keep His followers from being proud. Most of us like the distinction
of being noticed by people, and if they call you "Father," you sit up a little
straighter and no matter how high you go, even the Pope of Rome—that's
what "pope" means, "papa, father"—I don't think it ministers to the spir-
itual humility. Christ always taught humility. When James and John, the
two brothers, wanted special places at Christ's side when His kingdom was
established, He rebuked them. He said it was not His to give. It was for
those who earn it.
We knew that Dr. Morgan had done much work with the Boy Scouts
and Girl Scouts. In fact, he was awarded the Silver Beaver award, the
highest honor of a volunteer working with the Boy Scouts. He didn't really
tell us a lot about his work. To him, there was not too much extraordinary
about it. To be with young people and help them out is just an everyday
thing for him.
For most of my life since 1920, I have been connected in one way or an-
other with the Boy Scouts—scoutmaster, district chairman, member of the
council board. I'm still an honorary member of the Daniel Boone Council
which is this western end of North Carolina.
My first contact was down in South Carolina, back in 1920. I didn't
know much about scouting, but I knew that the boys needed some activity,
and so I had the bunch of boys down there at Chester get a troop together.
I had a rather amusing experience when I got to working with them. We
had a ministerial group and they called me to task for starting the scout
work without consulting them. I thought it was none of their business. If I
saw a need, then I tried to meet it.
While I was working with the scouts there, some of the younger boys,
under twelve, wanted activity, so I got them together and then I discovered
that in England and in Canada, they had what was called the "Wolf
Cubs" (the Cub Scouts, now) ; so, I sent for literature for the younger boys,
and we tried to follow that.
Then when I left Chester and went to Columbia, we had a troop under
the sponsorship of the St. John's Church of Columbia. And then when I
came up here, we had a troop connected with St. Agnes in Franklin, be-

cause I lived down there for a few years after I came back. I went out with
them a lot camping and studying wild life and so forth.
I was elected district chairman for the Boy Scouts in this district, and
then became a member of the Daniel Boone Council, and later I was also
on the board of the Nantahala Council of the Girl Scouts. They later
merged with the Pisgah Council, which now includes this territory.
We hiked the mountains—the Boy Scouts and I. I used to get them to
help me with the Appalachian Trail maintenance that goes the length of
the Nantahalas.
Dr. Morgan has also been an active member of the Appalachian Trail
Conference for many years. He has hiked parts of the Appalachian Trail in
New Hampshire, Vermont, Virginia, and Tennessee. He's hiked practically
all of it in North Carolina and down to the end of the Trail in Georgia. He
is still an avid hiker, in spite of very poor vision.
The first meeting that I attended of the Appalachian Trail Conference
was at Fontana Dam, North Carolina. At that meeting, a change was de-
cided upon which displeased me then and has ever since. I've been over the
section of the Trail through the Smoky Mountains National Park and loved
it very much. At that time, the Trail extended from the northeastern end of
the park to the southern end, going over Gregory Bald and Parsons Bald
down to the highway leading to Maryville, Tennessee. Fontana Village, a
resort village, was off the Trail. Probably under the influence of the place of
our meeting, a motion was made that the southern end of the Trail through
the park be changed, and come down a side ridge of the Smokies which is
called Shuckstack, on across the Fontana Dam, and then come into the Trail
as it then was, on Yellow Creek. Well, to me, Gregory Bald and Parsons
Bald are two of the most beautiful sections of the Trail. I'd been over them
and remember especially one trip when a group of us camped at a spring on
the side of Gregory Bald, having no tent but just sleeping out. We built up
a fire near the spring, and about ten o'clock rain came. Well, we got up and
chunked up the fire and tried to keep as warm as possible until morning. By
the time we started out in the morning, the rain had ceased and we climbed
up Gregory Bald. And there greeted us one of the loveliest scenes that I've
ever witnessed. We were above the clouds which had settled down in the
valleys, and we looked over the expanse of clouds, seeing only an occasional
island where a mountain peak came above the clouds. Then the sun rose.
There we were on the top of the world.
Well, that is what the Appalachian Trail, I thought and still think, ought
to be . . . a wilderness trail, foot trail. And to change it from a scene like
that to a recreational area of commercial interests seemed to me incon-
gruous. I objected to the change, but as I remember it, I was the only one

============================================================

REV. A. RUFUS MORGAN 
433
to object. I guess I was the only native mountaineer in the group. Anyway,
that's the only section of Trail, that new route, in the southeast down into
Georgia, that I've never been over, and I doubt if I ever will.
Going along the Appalachian Trail, you get all of the beauties that you
could ask for in the way of majestic trees, wild flowers of various kinds at
different times of the year. Going north from the southern end between
Siler Bald and Clingmans Dome, the highest peak in the Smokies, you come
across wood lilies, purple-fringed orchids, and all sorts of other wild flowers.
Going on from Clingmans Dome to Newfound Gap, I remember one
memorable trip under the leadership of Arthur Stupka, who was formerly
the naturalist in the park. All along the way from Indian Gap to Newfound
Gap, during that late April day, we came across carpets of spring beauty—
trout lily, trillium, and other wild flowers. Then going on north from there,
you strike other areas just as beautiful—witches hobble barely coming out
at that time of year coming into full bloom later, then changing later still to
the foliage that turns sometimes a yellow, sometimes bronze, like others of
the viburnum family. Then, of course, at different times of the year you run
across trees in bloom—sarvis trees, as we call them, or service as they are
otherwise called; silverbell; and later mountain ash. Then, in their turn, the
shrubs, like the red elderberry with its beautiful white blooms in the spring
and then later on their brilliant red berries. Then the various members of
the heath family, like the azaleas and rhododendron, sand myrtle, and such
a great variety of the wild flowers.
If you go north on the Appalachian Trail for two and a half miles, there
is a trail called the Boulevard Trail, that turns left and follows a spur ridge
into Tennessee, which leads out to Mt. LeGonte which is the third highest
mountain in the Smokies. That is one of my favorite mountain climbs. It is
6,593 feet- It has many advantages—wonderful lookout to the west to
watch the sunset, and then in the morning the beautiful coloring before sun-
rise, and then the sunrise itself at Myrtle Point, so-called because the sand
myrtle grows beautifully up there. And then there is a lodge on top of
LeConte and a shelter for hikers. There used to be a campground, but the
campers left so much litter that finally the Park Service forbid camping, but
if you get ahead of the other fellow, you can make reservations and get a
permit to camp in the shelter.
Another advantage of Mt. LeConte is that it Is accessible only by trails—
no road up there. I like that because an automobile road destroys the spirit
of the mountains. One of the trails, Rainbow Falls Trail, is the one that the
pack horses come up to bring provisions for the lodge. You have comfort-
able accommodations up there and you can get your supper and breakfast,
quite hearty meals, and you need them up there. Then the next day you can
come down. Quite often you run across bear up there. They're not apt to

harm you, although sometimes they rather resent interference, but as a rule
they're just looking for something to eat. That's not a very serious thing un-
less they get at your supply that you're depending on for the next day or
two.
As you look out toward the sunrise, you're looking toward the main ridge
of the Smokies, and the sun rises sometimes to the right, sometimes to the
left of a mountain which is the second highest in the Smokies, Mount
Guyot. It's a pyramid sort of peak and you always look for it. The Appala-
chian Trail doesn't actually go up to the top of Mt. Guyot, but circles
around to the left as you go north. You can break through the fallen timber
and seedling firs or balsam and get up there to the top, but you don't get a
very good view because of the seedling balsams, but it's nice to get up on
top.
There are sections of the Trail that are very lovely. You go farther north
out of the park and find Roan Mountain. Many years ago, there was a

============================================================

hotel right up on top, but it burned down or was torn down. I've been up
there when that was the only sign of having been trodden upon that was
there. There had been a furnace room under the old hotel, and I've slept
in that depression where the furnace room was, and let the wind blow over
me. On one trip I came across a man who lived not too far away, and he
told me about his father telling him that he had been up there many times
when the mountain grass was luxuriant, and he could see the deer, espe-
cially with their antlers, going through the grass, and you could just see the
movement of their bodies. I was interested in the southern approach to
Roan Mountain one time, and saw quite a lot of wild larkspur. I believe
that's the only place in North Carolina that I have seen it. Years before, I
had seen it up in the mountains of Virginia around Dante. It was in abun-
dance up there. Likewise, up there I had seen a great many beechnuts. I
find beechnuts in North Carolina, but they very seldom mature. They don't
have any nut inside, but up there in Virginia, they were very abundant.
I spoke of the meeting of the Appalachian Trail Conference. We meet
every three years. It is a wonderful fellowship and the group is made up of
representatives of the hiking clubs that maintain the Appalachian Trail
from Maine to Georgia—two thousand miles. They meet at various points
from north to south. The last meeting, 1972, was up in New Hampshire. I
went up to that, did a little hiking on the Trail up there. A few years before,
there was one up in Vermont and I attended that and got onto the Trail.
And then there was one up in Pennsylvania and before that in the Virginia
mountains and then one in Cashiers in our adjoining county. The next
meeting is to be in 1975 in Boone, North Carolina, in the Watauga section.
I hope to get to that. [He, in fact, did make the meeting.] At several of
these meetings, they allow me to conduct the sunrise service which is a priv-
ilege I appreciate very much.
Boone, where this next meeting is to be held, is near the crest of the Blue
Ridge Mountains and there are some wonderful hikes along there, espe-
cially Grandfather Mountain, which contains, so geologists tell us, the oldest
mountain mass in the world. The mountains through there, I have been
told, were at one time higher than the Himalayas are now . . . perhaps
39,000 feet, which is quite impressive. Grandfather Mountain was my pet
mountain to climb before I learned about LeConte. On the Monday after
the meeting of the A. T. Conference, I have a date with one person to go
up Grandfather Mountain, and since they "civilized" that one end of the
mountain, I go up the other end. In a way, I like that even better. There's
the beginning of an old trail, the Galloway Trail, not used much now, near
Linville Falls, and this is where we'll go in. It goes up to the Galloway Peak,
which is considerably higher than the one they've messed up. The balsams
and the mountain ash grow up there. The balsams, by the way, grow as far

south as the Smoky Mountains. If you're going south from Clingmans
Dome over Siler Bald, all of a sudden they give out, and you have hard-
wood trees from there south. Farther south than that, you never see balsams
or fir, except where they've been planted. I have some in my yard, which I
cherish very much.
It's been a pleasure to work with the A. T. Conference. I was on the
board for about thirty years, but six years ago they thought they needed
younger blood, and so they accepted my resignation. However, I shall al-
ways be just as interested in the Conference and the Trail.
It's difficult to keep the Appalachian Trail as a wilderness foot trail be-
cause the Wildlife Commission tries to protect the game and doesn't allow
shooting of deer along the way, and they plant pastureland in open spaces
along the Trail. To get in with their machinery, they make jeep roads, which
interfere with the Trail. And then there are always people who want to bring
in horses for horseback riding or bring in motorcycles for riding along the
Trail, but the organization as it was originally intended and is so designated
now by the U. S. Government is for foot travel only. There have been some
objections to the Trail going over private land, but the objection stems from
the misuse of the Trail by motor vehicles and horses, and not from the foot
travelers.
The headquarters of the A. T. Conference were in Washington for a
number of years, but recently they have moved to Harpers Ferry, West Vir-
ginia, which is right on the Trail, and which is much more satisfactory than
a big city like Washington. They get more visits from hikers, and it's a bet-
ter atmosphere for the meetings.
The Appalachian Trail was conceived of back about 1920, but I used to
hike over the mountains here nearly twenty years before that. I can
remember hiking from the adjoining county to which we moved, over here
to my grandparents' home when I was twelve or fifteen years old, some-
times the whole distance—sixty miles. Sometimes I'd take the train to
Andrews, cutting it down to forty miles. Sometimes we'd come by covered
wagon, but usually just hiking, and we always rejoiced when we got to the
border of Macon County, because that was coming home.
The Siler Bald here in the Nantahalas was named for my great-grand-
father, William Siler. He ranged cattle back in there and was one of the
prominent citizens of the area. That was probably the reason it was named
for him. I've hiked up it many times, slept on the side of it. There is a shel-
ter on the Appalachian Trail, right on the slope of it. Then there is the
other Siler Bald in the Smokies named for Uncle Jesse Siler, who used to
range cattle back in there. And there's another mountain nearby named for
my grandfather, Albert Siler, Albert Mountain. You can see that between

Rabun Gap and Franklin. There's a fire tower on it, on the Appalachian
Trail.
The only botany that I had in school was just one course one year when I
was in high school. I didn't learn very much. My mother loved the wild
flowers, and my father liked everything in nature. If you look there on the
bookshelves sometime, you'll see that I have several wild-flower books and
some on trees. There are so many things that you can pick up if you just
keep your eyes open. I've also had the good fortune to know people who
were botanists, or knew quite a lot about it. I knew Mr. Arthur Stupka for
years, a naturalist for the Smoky Mountain National Park, and I shared
with him some programs at the Penland School. Then I used to attend
what they called the Wild Flower Pilgrimage over in the Smokies at Gatlin-
burg the last week in April. Members of the botany faculty at the Univer-
sity of Tennessee in Knoxville used to lead some of those hikes, and so I
knew them, got a little information from them. And if you once become bit-
ten with the interest in wild flowers, you find leads. Like the orchids—you
get accustomed to noticing the characteristics of the blooms and the kinds
of places that they grow, and you follow these signs.
I have one book on our wild orchids. Then there are the ferns, which are
not wild flowers, because they have no blooms, but they are plants. When
you once find out that the way to identify ferns is to examine the sori or
spore pods, they'll tell you just where they belong, and what the name is.
You must just observe well enough. And then, of course, you have to have a
fern book, and fortunately there are some very good ones. One that I used
for years was by Dr. Blumquist, who is head of the botany department at
Duke University. It is Ferns of North Carolina. You will discover that there
is one native American fern which is a climbing fern, the Hartford fern. I
understand that that is the only climbing fern in this country. There is a
Japanese climbing fern; I got some roots of that last year from a friend in
Columbia. The native climbing fern is quite interesting.
After telling us quite a lot about ferns and wild flowers, Dr. Morgan
turned to recent highway development that has taken place right at his
property line. A super-highway has been built in his front yard.
The building of this new four-lane highway has distressed me. And all
that goes with it. I've sometime said that I wish a bulldozer had never been
invented. I can say that with a good deal of conviction. There is much in
our present world that distresses me, because it seems to me that the empha-
sis on the part of modern man is exactly contrary to the standards of Christ.
The emphasis on commercialism, including our government's emphasis
on cutting the timber, clear-cutting, which is devastation in my language,

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
and people coming in with the modern ideas of standards, not valuing our
traditional values here in the mountains, not valuing what you can do with
your hands, and handing out money to purchase a lot to build on, and in
that way reducing the possibility of the mountain people making a living on
their lands—all that bothers me. Having a government that doesn't know
its financial limits and is dominated by commercial groups, it's hard to hold
on to anything. For instance, you have your lobbyists in Washington for
modern machinery. They are pressing our legislators all the time for roads,
bigger roads, straighter roads. They're not thinking about the people along
the way. They're thinking about getting work for their machines, and sales
for their machines. They're backed up by commercial interests that want to
come in, by the tourist trade that wants the most direct route to get in, the
fastest way to get in. And the Forest Service is tainted by the same paint.
They want to sell timber. And one of their principal pleas is, "If we don't
cut the timber, then your schools will be without the income that comes
from a certain percentage of the returns from timber from your national
forests." So you have pressures on every side. We worship money.
The Forest Service is threatening to build a road up the Nantahala River
and across Deep Gap down the other side into Georgia to connect up with a
highway down there. This is just cutting through national forests. And then
another group is threatening to establish a recreational area in the corner of
the three states, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It includes
much of Macon County, and you know what that would mean, of course.
Commercial interests would come in to cater to the tourists, and just spoil
the whole area.
I've never been enamoured very much by the tourist idea. For instance,
when I was connected with our church camp and conferences over near
Hendersonville, every little while somebody would want to organize a group
to go to the Vanderbilt estates (in Asheville). I'm sure they're very beauti-
ful, but they're manmade, and I'd much prefer going back into Pisgah For-
est, which Vanderbilt also owned and turned over to the government, so
I've never been to the Vanderbilt estates.
I've been on the radio recently for morning devotions—the local station.
I took the very simplest thing that I could think of for my subject—the
Lord's Prayer. One morning I spoke on the petition for material things:
"Give us this day our daily bread." Not overflowing bins, not millions of
tons for our own profit, but give us—the people who need everywhere, and
let us realize that it's given to us to supply our needs. I quoted St. Paul,
"Let him that stole, steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with
his hands that he may have to give to him that needeth." And then Christ,
"Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, or
yet for your body, what ye shall put on."

============================================================
PAGE 436
============================================================

REV. A. RUFUS MORGAN 
439
And that, to my way of thinking, is exactly contrary to what we are actu-
ally engaged in now. We are beginning to discover that that can't satisfy
our needs. The fact that so many people are held for ransom is an indica-
tion that the people who are trying to get it from the millionaires, realize
that the millionaires shouldn't have it. And the hijackings are in the
same category, as is the scandal in our government. It's all the result of
man's being completely occupied in the thing that Christ told us not to do.
Of course, it leads to the downgrading in our estimation of God's creation.
In building our roads, we are influenced by politicians, by big business, by
people who make the modern machinery to grade the roads. They grade the
roads in order that man might have higher speed. We come up against the
situation that we have, for we've just been overreaching ourselves, cheating
ourselves, by going too fast, too far. That sort of thing is distressing.
Sometime back I went in to see a lawyer to get a deed made, giving to
my daughter and her husband their part of my property. I have very, very
little. I bought some of it for around twenty-five dollars an acre. A man
from Florida sometime ago wanted to know what I would take for it. I said,
"It isn't for sale."
"Well, if I offered you twenty thousand dollars for this little tract, would
you take it?"
I said, "No, it's not for sale, anymore than my children are for sale."
"Well, I think I could get twenty-five thousand for it for you."
I said, "No, it's not for sale."
Well, of course, it's for sharing. My daughter and her husband—he's re-
tiring—are moving back here and I'm giving that part of it to them. I love
my place, and I've planted most of the trees and the shrubs and other
plants on it. I've loved each one of them, and that's what it means to me—
it's God creation. We go roughshod over the whole thing. The business peo-
ple and those who live on business are against the idea of saving those things
or establishing wilderness areas. The Franklin Press, our local newspaper,
fights against the idea of wilderness areas, which might be kept for our de-
scendants in all their primitive beauty and grandeur, because it will take a
few dollars of our tax money which comes back to the county when we cut
down the trees in the national forests. It's that sort of thing, you see—we're
just in it for the dollar, for the accumulation to ourselves, regardless of the
destruction that we're bringing on our world.
But I hope we'll wake up in time. In the meantime, I walk along the
trails in the Smoky Mountain National Park and my companion stops and
he says, "Listen to the silence." We had left the bulldozers, speeding cars,
other machinery, down here. We go up there where there's peace.
What brought me back to these mountains was my heart. My mother
loved them intensely, as had my grandparents and great-grandparents. It

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
was just inbred. I've loved this place all my life. When we used to come
back and forth from Cherokee County, over here where the county line is
marked (between Macon and Cherokee counties), coming this way we'd
get down and kiss the earth, because we loved it so. When we'd go back, we
would get down and kiss Macon County good-by.
When I was fifteen years old, I came across the mountains for a wedding
in the family. When I went back home, I took back with me three seedlings
of the Canadian hemlock; and planted them out over there. One of them is
still living at the old homeplace.
The cabin that my daughter and her husband are fixing up is the first
home that I can remember. My people moved into it when I was three
years old, as I've told you. When I was a child, we used to play on the big
rocks that are still in the backyard. We'd rake up leaves and play various
games in them. A group of us would bury some of the rest of us under the
leaves and then when they were ready, we would say, "Rise, Jupiter, snuff
the moon." And those under the leaves would get up and scatter the leaves
everywhere. Oh, there are so many memories! Climbing the chinquapin
tree—there aren't any such now, but there was one back here on the knoll
then. There was another one over at the cabin that we used to climb and
shake the chinquapins down. It's just all in my blood. I've watched my
grandfather here in this room with his post office there in the corner, at-
tendifig to the mail, and I've loved those white oaks out jn the yard—three
lovely ones. And the hemlocks!
Well, to me it's just too beautiful for words. They have succeeded in
spoiling some of it, like building the roads, but they can't take away the
mountains as they stretch along here.
I can't express it, but somebody will have to prove to me that it isn't as
lovely as I think it is before I will be convinced.
These last years, since 1940 to 1975, have been particularly happy, both
within the church and in my relationships with other people in activities
that I've been able to carry on—climbing mountains, studying God's hand
in His creation, and the increasing number of friends—it's all been very
lovely.
A little question in our prayer book, in the section called "Offices of In-
struction" is: "What is your bounden duty as a member of the church?"
The answer is: "My bounden duty is to follow Christ, to worship God
every Sunday in His church, to work, to pray and to give for the spread of
His kingdom." And if you want it expressed in a prayer, I can think of
nothing finer than that which is called the Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:
"Oh, Lord, our Christ, may we have thy mind and thy spirit, make us
instruments of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let us sow love; where

============================================================
PAGE 438
============================================================

REV. A. RUFUS MORGAN 
441
there is injury, pardon; where there is discord, union; where there is doubt,
faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where
there is sadness, joy. Oh, divine Master, grant that we may not so much
seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be
loved, as to love; for it is in giving, that we receive. It is in pardoning that
we are pardoned, and it is in dying to self that we are born to eternal life."
I've been trying to live by that.

SASSAFRAS TEA
An unexpected visit paid to Pearl Martin might find her in the woods
behind her house digging roots for tea—most likely sassafras roots.
Sassafras is a wild plant that grows in the Appalachians. Left alone, this
plant grows into a medium-sized tree with an irregularly shaped trunk. The
spicy, distinct flavor of sassafras makes the tea a popular beverage, served
hot or cold. It is also used frequently in the Appalachians as a diaphoretic
and diuretic medicine.
Pearl makes sassafras tea, and she also uses the tea to make jelly. Mint
and spicewood teas, although not Pearl's specialties, are also made in her
home from mint leaves and spicewood stems she gathers in the woods.
Pearl has a field behind her house which she keeps bogged down (cleared of
brush) to allow her sassafras to grow freely. When the sassafras reaches
bush height, she digs it for tea.
Pearl told us that she could gather the roots any time of the year without
affecting the taste of the tea. However, the roots should be gathered young,
so they will be tender.

Next she scrapes
off the outer layer of bark and
discards it. Either the roots or the
bark can be used in making the
tea, but Pearl prefers the roots.
They can be used dried or green.

lon of tea, she boils four average-
sized roots in a gallon of water
for fifteen to twenty minutes. She
then strains it, and serves it either
hot or iced, sweetened with either
sugar or honey.
Pearl's recipe for sassafras jelly, which is made from the tea itself follows:
To make the jelly, mix one package of Sure-Jell with eight cups tea in a
large saucepan. Bring quickly to a hard boil, stirring occasionally. Now add
eight cups sugar and bring to a full rolling boil. Boil hard one minute, stir-
ring constantly. Skim off the foam with a metal spoon. Pour at once into
jelly jars and seal with paraffin.

PLANTING A GINSENG PATCH
Several weeks after. Buck Carver showed us how to build a still furnace
(see "Building a Still Furnace"), he came by and asked if we had noticed
the ginseng plant down by the still. We said we hadn't. So Buck said, "Let's
go take a look at it." We all went down to the still.
At first Buck wouldn't show the plant to us: he wanted us to spot it our-
selves. When we couldn't find it, he pointed toward it and smiled as we all
recognized it. He said he thought we ought to move it to another place, "To
keep it from being tramped down. People will always be in here looking this
still over, and ever so many of them won't know what sang is and will step

on it. And then a few of them will know what it is, and they might stick it
in their pocket and take it off."
Buck told us to pick the berries off the plant, and I stuck them in one of
my top shirt pockets; then he dug the plant up and took off the fat roots,
which I put in my other shirt pocket. Then he gave us each a few leaves
and sent us out into the woods to see if we could find any more plants. We
found four or five plants that day and dug them up. Buck told us to replant
them in dark ground shaded by poplars and hickories close to Wig's house.
Buck said, "If we don't put it here, someone will get it. Now Wig can sit on
his porch and watch his sang patch, by the way, and do his work too. You
got to keep an eye on that stuff. There's people that will steal that stuff that
wouldn't steal bread to eat. That's 'cause it's so expensive. And the big
reason it's so expensive is that it's so scarce."
He showed us how to plant both the roots and the berries, setting them
out just under the ground and raking leaves back over them. And while we
were planting them, he told us what the roots were good for:
"Now I'll tell you something that stuff will do. One morning about thirty
years ago we lived over here at Brian Kelly's, and I took a notion to go up
over in Joe Cove sang hunting. I said [to my wife], 'Have you got anything
left from breakfast that I could take for lunch?'
"She said, 'I got a few baked sweet potaotes and a few rashers of meat
and some biscuits.'
"I said, 'That's aplenty. Throw them together.'
"So she split some of the biscuits, and put some meat between them and
throwed in two or three baked sweet potatoes. And my ulcer was giving me
a fit at that time, and sweet potatoes would set it afire. Well, I never
thought, you know.
"Well, I went on over there in that cove and dug a pretty good bunch of
sang. Come dinnertime and I sat down and eat. Well, when I ate them
sweet potatoes, just in a few minutes I was a'burning. Oh brother, how sick
I was. I throwed up my socks I think. Down on my hands and knees a'gag-
ging and retching and trying to vomit and sometimes I could and some-
times I couldn't.
"Pappy Swanson was right down below me in a field cutting some tops,
and tell you the truth, a time or two I thought I would die. I was so sick I
come in a little of hollering for Pappy to come up there and help me get out
of them woods. I was afraid to start out of there by myself. I was so sick I
couldn't see nothing, and it was just as full of rattlesnakes and copperheads
as it could be in that country.
"I thought, 'Well, Lordamercy, Pappy's working and I don't want to
bother him.' I'd crawl out to the branch and drink water every few minutes

============================================================

and here it would come just as soon as it got warm. I'd just throw it up, and
the burning in that stomach, oh boy, was just like a ball of fire in there.
"After a while, I got to studying, 'Well, maybe if I wash a root of this
sang and chew it, it can't make it no worse and it might help me a little."
And I crawled out there to the branch and washed a root of that stuff good
and clean, took my knife and cut me off some little bites and put them in
my mouth and chewed it and swallowed that juice and spit the pummies
out. The pummies wouldn't have hurt me a bit to have swallowed them;
they probably would have helped me, but I didn't want to swallow them so
I just spit them. And you know it wasn't no time till I didn't have no pain
in my stomach or nothing.
"And I got up from there and I went on and sang hunted until durn
near night. And that's how good that was on that. It's the only thing I took,
and it's all I had to take. Boys, I was miserable, I'm telling you. I thought
my time had come there.
"And then you can chop it up right fine, or let it get good and dry and
put it on a food chopper or a sausage mill and grind it up and drop it into a
bottle of whiskey. And you don't take a bath in it! You just pour you out a
little of it if you take diarrhea or dysentery, and I mean you can have it
bad. Pour you out a little of it in a teacup and strike a match to it and set it
afire. It'll catch afire and burn. Burn it until that cup will be so dang hot
you can't hold it to your lips. You'll have to pour it over into another cup
that ain't had the fire in it. Drink it while it's good and hot. It's a bitter
dose—I don't mean maybe. And you don't have to drink much of it. Two
or three swallows. Turn it up and drink it, and if that don't stop that diar-
rhea you better get to a drugstore or to a doctor's office and don't lose no
time getting there.
"And another thing—old-timers used to go a'courting, and they were
nearly always ashamed to eat dinner with their girls and so forth, you know.
And their intestines would get to growling because they'd get empty. They'd
always carry a little piece of sang in their pocket and chew them a little
piece of that sang and they'd stop that. They called it guts growling. And
it'd stop them things from growling, too, I mean. It's embarrassing.
. 
said he guessed he'd eat a pound of it to keep them from growling
in front of his girl."
When we had them all planted, Buck told us to get some water in
buckets from Wig's house. When we brought it, he poured it gently over the
loose soil to help settle the dirt and give the roots a good start.

APPLE CIDER
In the early fall, the Foxfire class went to visit Mrs. Harry Brown of the
Betty's Creek Community who showed us how to make tasty, old-fashioned
cider. The entire class loaded into Wig's truck and headed out to the
Browns'. 
.
Upon arriving, we were greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Brown and Aunt Arie
Carpenter. Aunt Arie had come over from her home in North Carolina to
witness the cider making and to visit with some of her friends.
Mrs. Brown had the equipment and apples ready to start making the
cider. This consisted of the cider press itself, washed apples, pans to catch
the juice, or cider, in, and cheesecloth to strain the cider through. Of course
there were cups and a pitcher for us to sample the cider as soon as it was
poured.
Mrs. Brown explained to us that she and Mr. Brown prefer to use a pro-
portion of half sour and half sweet apples to make their cider. One can use
any type of apples available, and to make the cider sweeter or more tart,
you only have to add more sweet apples or more sour apples.
The cider is preserved by either canning or freezing. Mrs. Brown felt that

mill. The apples are placed whole
into the wooden hopper (1) as
the mill crank (2) is turned. The
apple pulp comes out the bottom
of the mill (arrow) and drops
into a slatted, bottomless tub.
When the tub is full, it is moved
to the left under the screw (3). A
wooden disc is fitted into the top
of the tub, and the screw (which
fits into a metal socket in the top
of the disc) is turned by means of
the crank (4), thus pressing the
disc down onto the apple pulp
and squeezing all the juice out.
While one person is squeezing the
juice, another places a second
slatted tub under the mill and be-
gins crushing another round of
apples.

the process of canning took away the "fresh apple" taste of the cider. She
prefers freezing her cider in plastic containers.
Aunt Arie told us how the old people used to make their cider without a
cider press. A wooden trough with holes drilled in the bottom, was filled
with apples. A maul was then used to mash or crush the apples. Then a
plank was pressed down on top of the apples to squeeze the juice out. The
cider was then stored in wooden barrels, some in the springhouse for drink-
ing, and some to be used for vinegar after aging.
Some of the class was curious about the difference between the taste of
apple cider—which we made—and apple juice. According to some of the
ladies in the community, apple juice is made by slicing the apples and boil-
ing them in a small amount of water. Then the liquid is poured off this and
either canned or frozen. Apple cider is the juice extracted from the crushed
apples, as we have explained above.

BLEACHING APPLES
We have mentioned bleaching apples as a means of preservation (The
Foxfire Book, pages 181-82), but had never had the process demonstrated
to us. Recently we heard that Mrs. Edith Parker was going to bleach some
apples for the winter, and we asked her if she would show us how.
Mrs. Parker has lived in Rabun Gap all of her life. Her children attended
our school. Since both Mr. and Mrs. Parker have regular jobs away from
home, they share the chores at home. Together they bleach about one and a
half bushels of apples a year. She prefers bleached apples over dried apples
because she feels they are easier to prepare. Both her grandmother and
mother have bleached apples in the past using the method they passed on to
her. One of her fondest memories is of her grandmother's churn full of
bleached apples. The kids would just pull out some and eat them. In the
middle of winter, they were like fresh apples to them. They have the taste
and consistency of apples cooked briefly without sugar or spices.
As well as bleaching apples, Mrs. Parker also cans corn, beans, and toma-
toes, and makes her own jellies. She makes pickled beans, pickled corn, and
sauerkraut.
Apples are usually bleached in late summer and will keep a year. A small
amount of water will be drawn out of the apples upon standing. This
doesn't affect them at all.
PLATE 399 
Aline Richards and Edith Parker begin by peeling, coring, and quar-
tering the apples. The Parkers prefer Ben Davis apples as they are drier, stay firmer,
and thus preserve better. They are unblemished apples that are not fully ripe, and they
do not wash the peeled apples before bleaching: this will make them soft, and they
won't last as long.

============================================================
PAGE 450
============================================================

PLATE 400 
While the apples are
being peeled, Mr. Parker has built a
small fire in the yard. When the first
batch of apples is ready to be bleached,
he and his wife put some hot coals from
the fire into a shallow dish.
PLATE 401 
The prepared apples are
put into a box and pushed up to the
sides, leaving a depression into which
the dish of coals is set. Then powdered
sulfur is sprinkled over the coals. There
is a short burst of blue flame when the
sulfur hits the coals, but the apples
don't scorch as it does not last long
enough. The lid of the box is then shut,
and the whole box is completely cov-
ered wiih i heavy towel to keep air

============================================================

FOXFIRE 4
PLATE 402 
The apples are smoked
until 
they 
become 
white 
(about
thirty—forty-five minutes). After about
twenty minutes, Edith lifts the lid to see
how things are going. If the smoke has
thinned out, she adds more sulfur. The
apples shrink 
somewhat 
during the
process.
When they are completely bleached,
the apples are removed from the box,
put into a crock churn, covered with a
clean cloth, and kept there until used.
The sulfur helps keep insects away
from them.
In cooking the bleached apples, use as little water as possible. Water
brings back the taste of sulfur, which is not noticeable at all when the
apples are eaten.
The Parkers enjoy apple pies made with bleached apples because they
taste so much like fresh apples. Mrs. Parker's recipe is to place several cups
of bleached apple pieces in an uncooked pie crust and add butter, sugar,
and cinnamon to taste. The pie can be covered with pastry strips or a sec-
ond crust if preferred. Bake in a preheated oven at 350° for 30-35 minutes
or until the crust is a golden brown.

FRIED-APPLE PIES
Six of us went to Blanche Harkins' house the other day to watch her
make fried-apple pies the way her mother did when Blanche was young.
To make the apple pies she uses either dried red or yellow apples. She re-
ally prefers yellow apples as she feels they make tastier pies.
To dry the apples, Mrs. Harkins first peels and cores them, then cuts
them into thin slices, soaks them in salt water, drains them, and lays them
out in a single layer on either a flat board or in a pan on a white cloth. She
puts them outside for several days in the sunshine to dry, and they shrink to

about half their original size. When completely dried, she stores them in
sacks in a dry place until she's ready to cook with them.
To prepare fried pies, she adds a small amount of water to the dried
apples, cooks them until they are tender, and then mashes them up with a
fork. She says, "Add enough sugar and cinnamon or allspice for your own
taste. For four small pies or tarts, use one quart of dried apples."
Mrs. Harkins' measurements for the pie crusts are approximately 4 cups
self-rising flour, l/2 cup Crisco, and 1 cup water. She makes the crust like a
regular pie crust. She divides the dough into balls about the size of her fist
for each pie, rolls the dough out into a very thin circle, then places the
cooked apples on one half of the circle. She then folds the crust over the
apples and presses the edges together wtih either her fingers or a fork. She
makes tiny holes or slits in the pies—either with a fork or knife—to let the
air out as the pies cook and to prevent the edges from turning up.
She puts enough Crisco into a large iron frying pan to almost cover the
pies as they cook. They can be baked instead, if preferred. To make the
crust crisp, she spreads melted butter on the pies before she puts them in the
oven.

HEWING
When I first started this article, I had no idea what I was documenting.
When I found out, I still could think of no purpose for a square beam as
opposed to a round log. I soon found out. Beams are used for everything
from mantels to flooring supports, benches to stairs. Besides these, there are
hundreds of other uses, most of which you wouldn't think of until the need
arose. The particular beam we documented was used with its duplicate
to form the sides for a staircase.
The man who showed us how to hew was Millard Buchanan. Millard
has lived most of his life in the Southern Appalachians, and worked on his
first cabin at the age of thirteen. He knows and can do everything for a tra-
ditional cabin from felling the first tree to fitting the last stone of the chim-
ney.
Millard used only two tools for the entire hewing operations (The
Foxfire Book, page 41): a double-bladed axe and an adze. It took Millard
about fifty minutes to hew this log, but it would take a novice anywhere
from two hours to two days, depending upon his skill. When the hewing
was finished, it was very smooth, except for occasional places where the
adze bit too deep.
PLATE 406 
Millard first splits the poplar
log in half and hews the inside smooth.
PLATE 407 
Then he turns the log flat side
down, and, straddling it, begins to smooth
the rounded side with powerful strokes. He
works forward, taking out large chunks in 4"
bites and leaving a trail of chips behind him.

============================================================

The adze was extremely sharp. Millard proved this to us by shaving about
an inch of hair off his arm. He said he had to sharpen it before each log or
it wouldn't work properly. Even with sharp tools, it is still hard work.
The easiest wood for hewing, he said, was white pine, and the hardest,
oak or hickory. This beam was made of poplar, which he said was about as
easy as pine.
The photographs show Millard at work on one of the beams.

Now, working back-
ward, sometimes standing beside
the log and sometimes straddling
it, he goes over the rough-hewn
side once 
again with smaller
strokes to take off another 2"
(thus getting the beam down to
the 
thickness 
he wants) 
and
smooth the side.

THE SADDLE LOCK NOTCH
There is a cabin on the Foxfire land that has the rafters hooked to .the
plates in a unique way. The notch used is called the "saddle lock notch" by
some of our contacts, not to be confused with the "saddle notch" used for
joining wall logs together at the corners of a building.
The cabin came from the Savannah Community near Webster, North
Carolina. We think it is from two hundred to two hundred and twenty-five
years old. This notch was not used very often for it was difficult to cut, and
there were not the accurate measuring tools we have today. Most rafters
were just notched to fit over the plate (see Plate 411), but the "saddle lock
notch" works differently. With it, the rafter sits down in a series of notches
cut into the plates. The dowel pins lock each rafter securely to the plate
(see Plate 411). Each rafter overhangs the outside edge of the plate by
about four inches.

and told us, "This notch is com-
mon in old buildings in my area.
It was used not only in log build-
ings but almost all types of struc-
tures built before 1860. . . . I be-
lieve this is a Pennsylvania Ger-
man innovation, and your exam-
ple could have been built by a
Pennsylvanian who moved down
there."
BOTTOMING CHAIRS WITH CORN SHUCKS
Chair bottoming by hand with natural materials is an art that has just
about disappeared due to mass production and the development of artificial
materials such as plastics, vinyls, acrylics, and various other cloth and
leather fabrics. Many people today don't care how well a piece of furniture
is made as long as it is pretty and will top or at least equal what someone
else has. Those people who do care about the quality of their possessions
often can do nothing about it because items of genuine quality, when they
can be found, are priced out of reach.
Mr. Harry Brown, Sr., still maintains an old craft tradition of high qual-
ity at reasonable price. On a warm sunny day in September, he came to the
campus for an interview with the journalism class. He was glad to share a
little of what he knows about the art of chair bottoming with corn shucks.
Mr. Brown said that when he was a boy, people made most of their furni-
ture. He also stated that he was not taught by anyone how to make a chair

bottom—he just picked it up as a hobby. Mr. Brown wove his first chair
bottom in 1910 out of white oak splits at the age of twelve (The Foxfire
Book, page 137). He has been making and caning chairs since that time.
Originally, he made his chair frames only from oak, but he now uses either
oak or cherry.
It takes about four to five hours to complete a chair bottom using corn
shucks. The completed chair has three layers of woven corn shucks and is
really a strong seat. Mr. Brown jokingly said that it would look like a pile of
corn shucks when it was finished. It doesn't though.
The weave that Mr. Brown used is called a raffia weave and is used quite
commonly.
The materials needed to make a corn-shuck chair bottom are: a bucket
for soaking the shucks, scissors, tape, clothspins, a clamp, corn shucks, and
plenty of patience. The corn shucks should have dried naturally, turned
brown and crisp. Do not use fresh green corn shucks. Mr. Brown said the
longer the corn shucks, the better.
Mr. Brown selected the longest corn shucks, put them into a bucket, and
poured warm water over them. He let the corn shucks soak for about fifteen
to twenty minutes.

pattern

the
weave. If the chair you are working on
is wider at the front than at the rear
(and most will be), measure and build
out on the front enough to make the
widths equal before starting on the pat-
tern shown.
Build out 
by 
tacking 
as 
shown—
following the directions across the front
—looping the corner as shown, then
cutting the material and tacking it.
Tacks should end up on opposite sides
of the frame.
Once you have built out enough to
equalize the widths, start the pattern in
the diagram.
Since 
most 
chair 
bottoms 
aren't
square but rectangular, the pattern will
need to change when you get to the cen-
ter. When you reach that point, the
original pattern no longer works. Sim-
ply loop around the frame in a figure
eight running between the longer ends
of the frame. When finished, tie the end
to one of the strands on the under side
of the chair bottom.

When they were ready, Mr. Brown took out a shuck and cut the shank
(the part of the shuck that is originally attached to the corncob at the base)
off so it would be even. He then tore the shuck into strips of about 3/4-to-1"
widths.
Next Mr. Brown took about three or four strips, placed them together
and twisted them in a clockwise motion, much as you would wringing out
some article of clothing, to form a "rope." He put a clothespin on the end
to keep the rope from unraveling. Mr. Brown continued adding strips to the
rope, staggering them every three or four inches to keep the rope as uniform
as possible. He placed clothespins on the rope whenever he needed to.
When Mr. Brown had twisted about two feet of rope, he taped the end of
the rope to the left side crosspiece about three inches from the front. Mr.
Brown then started the weaving process. He told us that in starting the
weave not to pull the rope very tight because, as the rope dried, the corn
shucks would constrict and pull apart. Also as you weave more and more
onto the chair, the weave would tighten naturally.
Mr. Brown continued adding corn shucks to the rope, and, as often as he
could, he wove the rope onto the chair. Every time that he wove the rope
on the chair and pulled it around a crosspiece, he took a clamp and
clamped the rope to the crosspiece so the weave would not loosen.
When the chair is finished and has had sufficient time to dry completely,
he puts a varnish on it to prolong the seat's life. Mr. Brown said that we
could probably find some chairs around that had been bottomed with corn
shucks that were fifty years old or older.

A TRADITIONAL LOOM
In Foxfire 2 (page 217), we ran a composite photograph of an old loom
owned by Gertrude Kenner. The photograph was not a good one, however,
because the conditions under which we were shooting made it almost im-
possible for us to get the photograph we wanted.
Recently, Harry Brown, Sr., was brought a similar loom for repairs. It
was constructed 216 years ago by Levi Swain out of yellow pine, and put
together with wooden pegs. Mr. Brown called us so that we could get pho-
tographs of it that would be better than what we had in stock. Then, over a
period of several months, he made a copy of it for us, and helped us move it
to our center where students now use it.

CASKETS
As late as the early 1940s, many people of the Appalachians were buried
in homemade caskets (see Foxfire 2, pages 304-23). Usually some of the
men in the community built the casket after a person had died; the ladies
would sew a lining for it while the men built it so that it was ready by eve-
ning. There were several men in the community who were regularly called
on to make caskets. They kept lumber cut and cured, ready to be used when
needed.
One such person in our community was Harley Thomas, a man who
makes spinning wheels, repairs and builds cabinets and gun racks, and can
do almost any other kind of woodwork, including making fiddles.
Some people liked to build their own casket or have it made to order long
before they needed it. It was usually kept in the hayloft of the barn. Various
people in our community told of having seen one stored in one of the
farmer's barns near here. We inquired about its history and found that it
had been made for this farmer's uncle, but he was staying with a daughter
in another state when he died, and the family had him buried there. The
kids remembered the casket being up in the barn for years after that, but it
has since disappeared.
We asked Mr. Thomas, since we couldn't find one already made, if he
would make us a child's casket, so that we could see how they were
made and how he decided on the measurements. It took him quite a while
to acquire some suitable white oak wood, and he never was able to procure
the brass hardware he wanted for the handles. So he improvised, as he
would have done fifty years ago, and made wooden handles.
Mr. Thomas told us that during the Depression, when the CCC camps
were located throughout this area, he had a contract with the government
to build caskets. His regular job was running a sawmill and building cabi-
nets and furniture, but he made caskets as needed.
When we lifted up the casket he made for us, we were startled at how
heavy it was for its size. He stained the white oak wood with a light brown
PLATE 424

PLATE 425
varnish and lined the inside with cotton batting and quilted white satin
tacked on over that.
Mr. Thomas shaped the bottom of the casket with the sides angled out
somewhat to make room for the shoulders of the body. He used to decide
how long the casket would be by adding a few inches to the length of the
person to be buried in it. The widest part of the casket is one-third the way
down the length of it. It then tapers back inward with the foot of the casket
being the same width as the head.
The pieces for the ends of this casket are 6'/2" wide and 8 3/4" high. He
nailed these onto the bottom first. He cut two white oak planks 8 3/4"X33"
long. To bend these pieces to fit the bottom, he cuts three grooves with a
hand saw or power saw from top edge to bottom edge about 1/2" apart and
about half way through the boards, as shown in Plate 424.
He then nailed on one side, starting at the head and forcing the side to
meet the bottom by placing the nails rather closely. By the time he reached
the foot, the board was securely attached to the bottom and bent at the de-
sired angle. He then nailed that side to the end. He did the other side the
same way, and when finished, the entire casket has the shape of the bottom.
He shaped a top to fit the casket, gluing on a smaller piece of wood
shaped like the top as a decorative touch. The top is attached to the casket
with three screws placed on either side. He used two wooden handles on
each side of the casket, although when he could get it, he used to use brass
hardware.

BUILDING A STILL FURNACE
For years we half-joked about getting someone to build us an actual-size
still so we could photograph the steps. Suddenly our wish came true, and
there was Buck Carver, one of our most faithful and most generous con-
tacts, down in a four-foot-by-four-foot hole, building a duplicate of his old
furnace for us and adding a whole new dimension to the work we had al-
ready done on moonshining (The Foxfire Book, pages 301-45). In the
process, a whole new set of tricks came to light. From Buck:
"Face the opening for the firebox downhill toward the stream as there's
usually a breeze coming up the branch to feed the fire.
"The hole in the throat needs to be about the same size as the opening of
the firebox to keep from choking the fire.
"Get as many rocks as you think you'll need; then lay in two or three
more loads, and if you're lucky you might not have to go back for more
than one or two loads more!"
And this: After we had made a trip to the site, Buck noted how people
scoffed when he told them it only took a couple of trips in to make a really
obvious path for law officers to follow. We smiled, then looked backwards
as he gestured with a grin toward the very obvious trail stretching out
behind us through the woods. . . .
DENNIS MAXWELL AND JAY HOLT
PLATE 426 The first step is to choose
a suitable hillside hidden in the woods.
Buck always sets his stills into a bank so
that he can stand on the ground behind
the still and get to it without using a
ladder. The site selected, he and Joey
Fountain, one of the Foxfire students,
dug out the hole for the furnace.

============================================================

smooth up the hole, the floor of which
will be the floor of the still's firebox.
PLATE 428 Next, Buck cemented into place the first two courses of flat rocks thus
outlining the firebox walls. Years ago, red clay would have been used instead of ce-
ment, and the site for the still would have been partly determined by the availability
of clay. In the left foreground, notice that the flat rock at the back of the firebox is set
on its edge and sloped backward slightly so that it will deflect the flames upward
around the still (see also Plate 431).

============================================================
PAGE 470
============================================================

PLATE 429 
When the walls of the firebox were high enough (see Plate 431 for
measurements), Buck set the large flat rock he had chosen for a bedstone into place so
that it spanned the firebox. As it wasn't quite long enough, he set a second, smaller
rock into place behind it and cemented the two together to make one flat platform for
the still to sit on.
PLATE 430 
The hole left at the back of the platform is for the flames, which will
come up from the firebox below and wrap around the still, heating the contents to a
boil.

============================================================
PAGE 471
============================================================

PLATE 431
PLATES 432-433 
The next step was to set the still itself, a thirty-five-gallon copper
outfit, in place on the bedstone and mark the spot where the slop arm would stick
through the furnace wall. Then he started putting the next layer of rocks into place
making sure to leave space for the flames between the still itself and the rock walls of
the furnace.

============================================================
PAGE 472
============================================================

PLATE 434 When the walls
were up about a foot above the
bedstone, Buck removed the cop-
per still and placed a 3"-thick
layer of red clay on top of the
bedstone to insure that no flames
ever hit the bottom of the still
and burned a hole in it. Then he
proceeded with the next round of
rocks, leaving an 11 1/2" hole in
front for the scuttle hole or smoke
vent.
PLATE 435

============================================================
PAGE 473
============================================================

PLATE 436 When the rock sides were high enough to reach the cape of the still,
Buck set it back into place.
PLATE 437 
Then he sealed the hole around the slop arm with red-clay mud while
one of the students helped by lining the sloped inside back wall of the furnace with ce-
ment and smoothing it up.

============================================================
PAGE 474
============================================================

PLATE 438 
Next Buck set flat rocks in place around the cape to form the top of the
furnace.
PLATE 439 
When the rocks were selected and in place, he cemented them in com-
pletely to seal up the furnace except for the firebox hole and scuttle hole in the front.
This forces any fire built in the firebox to expend its heat around the sides of the still
before venting out the front. The operation is now ready for the addition of the cap,
cap arms, and so on.
After the still was cemented into place, another reason for the use of red clay over
cement by many moonshiners became obvious: most wanted the mobility that comes
from being able to dismantle their operation quickly and move the copper still to
safety when in danger of being discovered. Walls cemented with red-clay mud are eas-
ily knocked down.

ASH HOPPERS
One of the best-designed ash hoppers (The Foxfire Book, page 156)
we've seen was shown to us during a visit to Lookout Mountain, Tennessee,
to talk with potter Charles Counts. We were staying at the Fairyland Motel,
and in the back yard sat the ash hopper pictured here. It was built by Mar-
tin Pilgrim, now deceased—an old mountain man who helped the owners
of Rock City lay out the stone paths through the rock cliffs of their tourist
operation.
The hopper, roofed with shingles, has a hinged roof for easy entry, and a
tin spout at the bottom from which the lye dripped whenever water was
poured onto the ashes.

He then takes the wood to a pipe he has mounted horizontally onto the
side of one of his outbuildings. He places one end of the bow into this pipe and the
other end into a second pipe which he uses to pull with. As he pulls the section of
hickory into an arc, it splits a little as is normal. At the point where it begins to split,
he attaches a "C" clamp to help keep it from splitting any fmther.
PLATE 444 Will inserts a piece of
board in the curve to keep the bow
from snapping, and bends it on around.
When it is bent far enough, he holds the
bow in place with his left leg while he
attaches a wire to keep it bent.

Then he slips the bow
out of the pipes. The clamp will be left
attached until the wood has dried. The
bow can either be placed in a yoke and
the wire removed, or it can be stored
for later use, leaving the wire on to hold

THE DISHRAG GOURD
In the past, some families in our area raised Luff a cylindrica, using the
young gourds for food, and the old, mature fruits for sponges. What hap-
pens is that as it ages, this unusual plant develops a tough, fibrous inside that
is spongy, durable, and ideal for use in scrubbing dishes and pans clean. To
get at the inside, one simply has to peel off the brittle outside crust (some
soak the gourds overnight before peeling, but it can be done dry also). The
seeds, which arc loose in the hollow center of the fruit, can be saved for
replanting in the spring as soon as the danger of frost is past.
Many families in our area buy the seed for this plant from the George W.
Park Seed Company, Greenwood, South Carolina 29646. Organic Garden-
ing has, from time to time, run articles about the luffa (June 1974, for ex-
ample ) for those who desire more information.

AFTERWORD
by Richard M. Dorson
I
n the past Eliot Wigginton and I have
had our differences. I have criticized
the Foxfire books for dealing with the
materials of folklore and folklife in an incomplete way. "Wig" retorted that
he had no intention of training folklore scholars but wanted to arouse his
bored students and get them interested and aware and alive to their sur-
roundings and their people. He was a journalism teacher, and had never
heard of folklore during his college years at Cornell. As a university pro-
fessor of folklore and director of Indiana University's Folklore Institute, I
felt that he had an obligation to his students and his large reading public
to acquaint himself with the methods, collections, and studies of the folk-
lorist and use them selectively for the enrichment of his materials. To which
Wig queried, why didn't the Ph.D. folklorists go outside in the mud to find
the people and get their diplomas dirty instead of sniping at little folks
from the safety of their certificate-lined walls? At the end of this exchange
in the pages of the North Carolina Folklore Journal Wig invited me to
Rabun Gap and I invited him to Indiana University to continue our dia-
logue.
In June 1976 Wig did come to Bloomington, and he and I held what
was billed "The Great Debate" before the graduate students and faculty
of the Folklore Institute. I attacked him for presenting a nostalgic, romanti-
cized picture of mountain folk and their ways. He asserted that the Foxfire
books portrayed with complete accuracy the people of Nacoochee—and he
convinced me. On the conclusion of this duel Eliot Wigginton's eloquence,
sincerity, and humanity had won us over and I said as much. He is indeed
a brilliant and inspired educator, who has appreciated, and taught his stu-
dents to appreciate, the values to be learned from a traditional culture in
the southern mountains. It is a tribute to his openmindedness that he will
give the scholars of traditional cultures a chance to make their point, and
has invited me to tender this statement in Foxfire 4.
There are two connected thoughts that I as a professional folklorist wish

to express about the Foxfire books. First, their contents are one hundred
percent folklore and folklife. Second, scholars have been collecting and
studying folklore and folklife for nearly two hundred years. Neither of these
facts has been recognized in the first three Foxfire volumes. Readers can en-
joy these warmly human books as they stand, but they should know that
folklorists have collected similar practices and customs and life experiences
for other parts of the country and also quite different traditional lifestyles
for other Americans. The Foxfire concept has led students out of the class-
room into their community, to speak with their grandparents and neighbors
and new friends, and learn their folk wisdom and folk history, and this is
admirable. But the logical extension of the Foxfire idea will then be to lead
the students into the library, to dig for and locate counterpart items to the
folklore they have uncovered, and to develop an interest in other peoples.
They will discover with an eerie thrill that a supposedly local incident, told
as a gospel true happening, has been reported in distant places and over
long stretches of time.
A Maine lobsterman once told me of a "cove about two mile below where
I live called Yoho Cove" named for a wild man who lived there years ago
and always hollered "Yoho, yoho." When a party of natives went raspberry-
ing by the cove one time, the Yoho ran out of the woods, grabbed a girl
from the group and made off with her. A couple of years later this party
returned to the cove, and the girl rushed toward them, carrying a year-old
baby and screaming for help. The berry pickers lifted the girl into the canoe
and pushed off from the shore, when the Yoho ran down to the water,
seized the baby, tore it in half, and with a hideous yell threw one part at the
retreating canoe. "So it's been called Yoho Cove ever since."
This account sounded real enough, but the folklorist senses that the same
gruesome episode may be reported elsewhere. His research discloses that the
tale of the Yoho is told in the Kentucky mountains, in French Canada, and
in several European and Middle Eastern countries. Foxfire student-inter-
viewers, like all folklore collectors, must learn how to distinguish factual
from fictional narratives. The line is not clear, for historical figures, like
Jesse James, become embellished by legends, and imaginary heroes, like
Paul Bunyan, are given historical roots.
As they read about folklore in the library, students will come to know
that traditions thrive in the cities as well as in the hills, among factory and
office workers as well as among mountain people. They will learn that
folklore reflects the concerns of the present far more than the remembrances
of the past, and that the automobile, for example, is a subject of many
legends. If they pursue the study of folklore in college and graduate school,
they will find themselves looking deeply into the cultural behavior of
humankind.

AFTERWORD
A strong word of caution. Too many writings about so-called folklore
may deceive and misinform rather than enlighten and instruct, for the pro-
fessional folklorists are few and the amateurs and popularizers numerous.
Beware of fakelore—a term I coined in 1950 to denote the spurious, syn-
thetic, and syrupy distortions of folklore. The Foxfire books contain exam-
ples of genuine traditional folklore and folklife, collected and recorded with
notebook, tape recorder, and camera, and not invented or "improved" by
writers who have never talked with the folk. Part of the educational ideal
represented by the Foxfire concept will be fulfilled if teacher, student, and
reader recognize the distinction between books of folklore and books of
fakelore. Their titles often sound the same. The following list is suggested
as an introduction to the subject matter of folklore and folklife.
Bibliography (* indicates volumes are available in paperback) :
Without too much apology I will begin with some of my own books. My
most recent one is Folklore and Fakelore (Harvard University Press,
1976); the first essay recapitulates some of my battles to establish folklore
studies on a sound basis, and other essays illustrate the theories and research
methods of the folklorist. Two similar volumes of my collected writings are
Folklore, Selected Essays (Indiana University Press, 1972) and American
Folklore and the Historian (University of Chicago Press, 1971). A general
survey of the discipline on an advanced level is Folklore and Folklife, an In-
troduction (University of Chicago Press, 1972) which I edited, and to
which eighteen professionals contributed chapters on their special fields;
each chapter contains an annotated select bibliography for further readings.
My American Folklore* (University of Chicago Press, 1959), and America
in Legend* (Pantheon, 1973) discuss the folk traditions of the American
people within a historical framework, and Buying the Wind, Regional Folk-
lore in the United States* (University of Chicago Press, 1964) provides ex-
amples with comparative notes of those traditions as collected in seven re-
gions. My field work from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is presented in
Bloodstoppers and Bearwalkers* (Harvard University Press, 1952, repr.
1972).
A widely used introductory textbook is The Study of American Folklore
by Jan Harold Brunvand (Norton, 1968), which presents the categories of
folklore in the United States. Brunvand has also brought out Folklore, a
Research Guide* (St. Martin's Press, 1976) to orient teachers and students
new to the subject. A more advanced work is The Study of Folklore, edited
by Alan Dundes (Prentice-Hall, 1965), who reprints scholarly essays by a
number of folklorists.1 American Folklife, edited by Don Yoder (University
1 A book which we've found extremely useful is A Manual for Field Workers by Ed-
ward D. Ives (Northeast Archives of Folklore and Oral History, Orono, Maine, 1971).

of Texas Press, 1976), contains articles especially written for that volume by
specialists on folk crafts and material culture. A symposium devoted to
American Folk Legend produced an excellent series of papers, published in
a book with that title, edited by Wayland Hand (University of California
Press, 1971). Dundes has also edited a selection of interpretative essays on
Afro-American folklore in Mother Wit from the Laughing Barrel* (Pren-
tice-Hall, 1973).
Turning to field-work collections and writings, I recommend first an
older title that is a model for the regional collector, Emelyn E. Gardner's
Folklore from the Schoharie Hills, New York (University of Michigan
Press, 1937). A notable collection of family saga from Kentucky is Leonard
Roberts' Sang Branch Settlers (University of Texas Press, 1974). The tra-
ditions of fishermen on Maryland's eastern shore are adeptly presented by
George Carey in A Faraway Time and Place (Luce, 1971). A pioneering
work of folk history combining oral and documentary sources to reconstruct
the history of a vanished Kentucky settlement is Lynwood Montell's The
Saga of Coe Ridge (University of Tennessee Press, 1970). How historical
events and personalities generate folk legends is demonstrated for the Mor-
mons by Austin and Alta Fife in Saints of Sage and Saddle (Indiana Uni-
versity Press, 1956). Immigrant and ethnic folklore has not yet been well
collected and studied, but Carla Bianco in The Two Rosetos (Indiana Uni-
versity Press, 1974) has made an authoritative contribution, in comparing
the folk traditions of Roseto, Italy, and its colony Roseto, Pennsylvania. A
fine study of a Mexican ballad and folk hero celebrated in the southwest is
by Americo Paredes, "With His Pistol In His Hand": A Border Ballad and
Its Hero (University of Texas Press, 1958), dealing with Gregorio Cortez.
The lore of occupations is also undercollected, but a skillful interpretation
of one is Mody C. Boatright's Folklore of the Oil Industry (Southern
Methodist University Press, 1963).
These titles and their bibliographies can lead readers into the charmed
garden of folklore.
