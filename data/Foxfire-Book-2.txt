ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Hundreds of people have helped us, and to those people—they all know who
they are—we literally owe our survival. A list of them would encompass every-
one from parents who have let us send their kids into the mountains alone, to
school administrators who have let us take kids away from their normal rou-
tines, to journalists who have given us an immense amount of support through
their publications, to people who have generously donated money, time, energy,
advice, and expertise.
But rather than detail those people, I'd like to dedicate this space to a man
who, perhaps more than any other, drastically affected the future of our ex-
periment. That man was the director of the National Endowment for the Hu-
manities' Education Division—Herb McArthur.
Foxfire was three years old, and I had spent the better part of a year seeking
additional financial support. As testimony to that struggle, I refer you to a
manila folder in my office packed with letters from foundations and organiza-
tions—most of which I had visited personally—saying, in essence, that they
liked the idea but could see no way to help us. Herb listened to me one day in
his Washington office, liked the Foxfire idea, and saw a way to help us out. The
end result of that collaboration was two grants totaling nearly twenty thousand
dollars that moved us about eight giant steps forward by allowing us, among
other things, to purchase videotape equipment, darkroom equipment, send kids
to New York on exchanges, and hire Suzy—our first paid employee.
Herb has agreed to resign at the request of Ronald Berman, the newly ap-
pointed NEH head who, according to the September 4, 1972 issue of Time has
vowed to return the NEH to a "strict constructionist" view of the humanities
(supporting such things as a television series on Shakespeare's plays) and away
from "Classic Comics—culture simplified and castrated." All well and good.
But it frightens me to think that this might also mean that other stumbling ex-
periments like ours will be passed over in favor of "professional studies profes-
sionally run."
Herb's genius was that he could recognize and encourage highly experimental,
often risky projects—but projects having the look of a winner about them—and
urge that they be assisted. In a day when most of us find only financial rejec-
tion at the state and local level, the only place we have left to turn is to larger
foundations with directors like Herb. I can only hope for all our sakes that
somewhere there are more of them around.

INTRODUCTION
ne evening a couple of
years ago, with some ci-
cadas making a decep-
tively comfortable racket outdoors, and the mountains easing from
green to blue to purple, I sat down alone at a desk full of papers and
photographs and notebooks and articles torn out of magazines and
loose paper clips and Bic pen tops and empty film cans and general
trash like that; and I shoved it all around and got enough flat space
to make an introduction to a book some high school kids and I had
put together. That was the first Foxfire Book.
It was no piece of cake—that introduction. Mostly it was hard be-
cause I was trying to tell a lot of people who had never heard of us
who we were and what we were doing. That's done now. This evening
I sit down alone at the same desk, having just made another flat
space and nodded to the mountains, prepared to do it all again; and
I feel some sease of relief at not having to tell over again the story of
Foxfire. Tonight I just feel like talking some on paper.
A lot has happened down here since that first introduction. But the
cicadas outside are at it again tonight just like they were before. They
haven't changed. The world goes on. There's something there to won-
der a t . . .
Meanwhile, there's this second book that on the surface is about the
same thing the first one was about—namely, one group of people and
how they dealt. Simple. But I suspect that if you really got into the
first volume, you know already it had to do with a lot more than that.
Perhaps you're the kind who once knew a grandfather who was ex-
traordinary, maybe for no other reason than that he didn't give a
flying damn that he was poor as Job's turkey as long as everyone he
cared about was dry and warm, and that there was hot food on the
table, and a couple good neighbors, and time to hike up into that cove

above the cabin to see if there were any four-prongers this year in the
'sang patch. Or maybe for the fact that he was one of those rascally
scoundrels who ran a liquor still in a basement right in the middle of
town and vented his smoke out the same chimney the courthouse
used. Like that.
Or maybe you know people like Suzy and Harry. Suzy works with
us. I don't remember just how it happened except that she was a
VISTA here, and when she was done with that, we got her. And she
married Harry from Virginia who learned how to make pots from Bob
Owens and drove a beat-up Chevy pickup on its fourth transmission
and grew a beard. And Suzy used to come in to work every day with
great plum-colored bruises on her legs where she had fallen down be-
tween the floor joists of the house they were building by themselves in
a pine thicket near Tiger. And she was always laughing, and the kids
would crowd around and want to help—and she and Harry let them.
Or you know and probably care deeply about some high school
kids, and maybe this kind of thing has happened to you. Then you'd
understand the day when I was in the office and Suzy was in the out-
side room and I heard her laughing—as usual—except she was really
cracked up this time, and so naturally I had to go out and see what
was happening, and she said just be quiet and listen. And Carlton,
one of the tenth grade kids, had been in the darkroom alone for an
hour and I had forgotten—and God he was missing his English class
—and this string of muffled swear words suddenly drifted through the
darkroom door. Yep. Carlton was still in there—oh, hell, that English
class—trying to make a double exposure print for Karen's and Betse's
burials article. And he was trying to figure out how to do it and burn-
ing up all this printing paper and coming closer and closer to getting it
just right and talking to himself explaining what was wrong like
there were seventy-eight people watching. And Suzy had been listen-
ing to the struggle, laughing, when—Bam—out he came with a drip-
ping wet print and a There how does that grab you—and it was beau-
tiful, and we used it on the cover of the magazine that had that article
in it (and in the book). And Suzy and I were both laughing, and then
Carlton cracked up too. And we slapped him on the back and he
punched us and we laughed some more. And then he went to English.
And when he got to English, he had to write five hundred times,
"I will not be late to class any more."
And the teacher read some poems aloud that nobody listened to, so
she spent the whole hour reading to herself while the kids hacked off
or slept. Sort of like us in church five minutes into the sermon. You
know

INTRODUCTION
All that's true. And I guess if you really understand what this book
is about, you've had some of that happen to you because this book is
really about those kids like Carlton and what they did in between
algebra problems. See, this isn't really a ''How to Survive in the
Woods" manual, although it does show how one specific group of peo-
ple in one specific time and place did survive. I just want to explain
that to some of you who may be irritated because we haven't told you
how to vent your outhouse yet. See, mostly this book is about school,
and about community, and about people, and about the great ad-
venture life can be when lived intensely. And about the fact that
instead of celebrating with our kids the infinite variety and ingenuity
of nature and man, we are still allowing them to be drowned in the
Franco-Prussian wars.
Sometimes, on cicada nights like this, I do a lot of thinking. Mostly
it's thinking about stuff that's happened since the first Foxfire Book
came out—about letters we've gotten, schools we've seen, groups we've
visited and talked with. We made some good friends through that book
—friends who intuitively understood what we were saying, knew they
were saying it too (though in different ways), and got in touch. And
sometimes I am overwhelmed by optimism when I watch them at
work with those fragile, humane experiments like the Opportunity II
school in San Francisco, The Young Film Makers and the Fourth
Street i and the Teachers' and Writers' Collaborative in New York
City, and Interlocken's Crossroads America Program. And I know
good things are happening to the kids involved. I know it's making
a difference.
But inevitably the optimism I feel when I dig in with those people
and share their adventures—inevitably that is tempered by the sounds
of human cicadas that endure and drone on and on endlessly into the
night.
"I will not be late to class any more."
And they never understand.
Sometimes I lie awake at night and think about all that. Strange
stuff to think about, I know; and I probably wouldn't except that it
constantly colors my life and the lives of kids I care about.
What do I say, for example, in answer to the stacks of letters I get
from teachers asking questions like, "My pupils are so listless, so unin-
terested. How can I motivate them?" Or, "I would like to start a proj-
ect like yours. Would you please tell me exactly how to go about doing
so from beginning to end?" How can I answer questions like that,
knowing that the only way it can work is for the teacher to push back

the desks and sit down on the floor with the kids and really listen to
them for the first time, and see what they can all come up with to-
gether that might work in the context of their own particular school
and community—and they try to find ways to make it work for as
long as it seems worth doing—and then find another. Knowing all
the while most teachers won't bother to do that. Knowing they want
texts and learning kits and packets that tell them how. Knowing
they're missing the greatest adventure of all. And so are their kids.
How do you get to those teachers?
And what do I say to kids who ask me for one good reason why
they should stay in school and stay straight when they've just been
humiliated in front of their classmates for answering a question wrong,
or just been punished for doing something that deserved no punishment
(or something they didn't do), or just flunked a course by one point
—a course they'll now have to repeat. Or a kid who's on the verge of
running away?
What do I say to those faces?
And what do I say to a state's education organization that's trying
to prevent the teaching of journalism by any teacher not properly cre-
dentialed in that area, knowing I never had a course in journalism or
folklore in my life? What do I say to them, knowing our magazine has
been written about in virtually every publication of any note in this
country—but has yet to be mentioned, after seven years of operation,
in our own state's education publications (and there are several). I
should think that at least half the time of such organizations would be
devoted to ferreting out projects of some potential worth, helping them
when they need it most (as we did often during those first three years),
and putting them in touch with others who can act as support, as valid
critics, and as invaluable resources. We operate in vacuums.
What do I say to them?
I lie awake and think about that stuff. I can't help it. And I am
filled with dread at the thought that that mentality will prevail, driv-
ing out the next Pat Conroys, Herb Kohls, Jim Herndons, and Jona-
than Kozols in the process—along with the fragile, humane experi-
ments. Because I know that if it's a lost struggle, everyone loses: the
kids, the society that gets them next, and the teachers who scurry back
to the safety of their texts and shelve their imaginations and their
enthusiasms and their dreams for better times.
Then I remember Myles Horton—constantly engaged in causes
bigger than himself—and what he says to people who lie awake at
night: "You must not worry about things you have no control over.
Make peace with yourself, choose your battle carefully, fight there

INTRODUCTION
and there alone to make things right, and leave the rest." And that
makes a certain amount of sense. If our battle is to go roaring into a
school, try to change it, and get fired in the process, then that's one
thing. But I am rapidly reaching the point where I believe my battle
is with a tiny group of kids who happen to be working on a magazine
called Foxfire, and with what happens to them in the process of that
involvement. And that is all I can afford to worry about. They are my
challenge now. Period.
Perhaps that's all any of us can do. Choose one small piece of turf,
be honest with ourselves, choose our approaches, stay in touch, re-
main constantly open to new ideas and new approaches, shut up, go
to work, and hope for the best.
That is what I find myself doing. For the record, then, and for those
who are still reading and curious, and for those who have written and
asked, these are the principles I operate by today. They will change
in time, but for now these are my touchstones.
First, I've found that the world of most of my kids is filled with so
much negative energy imposed from outside sources that they have no
choice but to withdraw into themselves and their circle of friends for
sanity, safety, and some sense of belonging. Examples come to mind
immediately: the shopkeeper who automatically suspects the kids are
going to steal; the waitress who automatically assumes the kids are
going to make a mess and be a pain in the neck; the dormitory, home,
or classroom where, whenever the kid hears an adult call his name, he
recoils, wondering, "What am I going to have to do now?" or, "What
have I done this time?" Or where a kid is met at the door with that
special gaze designed and perfected through years of practice that
says, "I'm here, see? Any trouble and you're going to wish there
hadn't been, and I'm not kidding." The air is charged with it.
How many times have I seen the effects of a great day evaporate
like mist before the door of a classroom or home? A fourteen-year-old
gives a talk before a group of 450, is mobbed afterwards by people
wanting to ask questions, thank him, or get his autograph on the
article he wrote in the last Foxfire; and that night, giddy with happi-
ness and accomplishment, he is met at home by a mother who chews
him out for forgetting to make his bed that morning. He says, "But,
Mom, let me tell you what just happened to me." And she says, "I
know already. You got caught smoking, right?"
And then those adults wonder why there's no communication;
wonder why the kids don't want to come home at night. What choice
have we given them?

INTRODUCTION

I've been building a six-sided log house on the side of a mountain
near here. Kids help me all the time, of course—nearly every day—
and some of the finest experiences of any of our lives have happened
there. We have no blueprints (read curriculum guides), so when
someone gets a brainstorm and suggests we move a window, or shove
a wall two feet farther out, or stick in a skylight, we often do it. A
couple of weeks ago six of us got the last wall log up, notched and
secured, and mounted the first floor joist for the second floor. It was
a moment we'd been working toward for months; and when we
finished, we charged down the mountainside to The Villager, a local
restaurant, for a celebration. Kate, who owns the place, let me cook
up some stuff for them, and we all laughed and ate and laughed—
really did it up right. But I made sure I got them back to the dorm that
night in plenty of time for study hall.
The next day I was treated to a display of real anger by the dormi-
tory houseparents. Mostly it centered around the fact that the kids
had come in noisy for study hall, and they just weren't going to have
any more of that. Instead of sharing that experience with those kids,
they had landed on them, saying that if it happened again, they'd
make a rule that the kids would either have to be in a full half hour
before study hall, or just not go outside before study hall at all. Here
we go again.
The obvious corollary is that not only do we too rarely share a kid's
ideas and joys and triumphs, and not only do we too rarely put them in
situations where they can triumph, but we also do not trust them. They
cannot be in such and such a place unsupervised. They cannot be left
with this decision. They cannot be expected to carry out that task.
And so we retreat behind rules that bind them up.
To say kids cannot be trusted is the most personally damning state-
ment any adult can make, for it simply reveals either that he can
neither create nor endure the kind of atmosphere in which a kid can
try and perhaps fail (read learn) and yet not be damned; or that he
is not an inspiring enough individual to make them want to participate
with him as responsible partners in a common goal.
I'm not just spouting idealistic jargon. I've seen it work the other
way. The Hill School, for example, where kids can work alone on inde-
pendent study projects in most of the campus buildings far into the
night; or another school I know of where the kids even have the re-
sponsibility of deciding at the end of the year which teachers get re-
hired; or our school where an inspired work supervisor has turned
over the supervision of the campus work crews to the kids.
Too many of us fall short of that love and patience and self-confi-

============================================================

INTRODUCTION
dence it takes to work with kids as equal partners. We must do better.
There is so little joy in the world of most kids. The recognition of
worth and accomplishment is so strained and so stingily parceled and
our condemnation so freely given that it completely overwhelms the
elation of any positive, shared experiences. I find it no mystery at all
that kids tune us out.
And if you think I'm exaggerating, you're probably part of the
problem.
Second, I believe that in most cases the most rewarding and signif-
icant things that happen to a kid happen outside the classroom: falling
in love, climbing a mountain, rapping for hours with an adult who is
loved or respected, building a house, seeing a part of the world never
seen before, coming to some deep personal empathy with a kid from
another background and culture, or genuinely understanding some
serious community or national problem.
These are all things that may later give him the motivation neces-
sary to want to be able to write correctly and forcefully, or want to
know history, or want to understand the complexities of nature and
man through biology, botany, psychology, anthropology, or physics.
But we too often ignore these events, seeing them as "irrelevant" or
"froth." Until they are acknowledged as important and relevant to the
student's existence, all he does inside those walls is doomed to seem
meaningless and without reason. What we must realize is that the
walls of those buildings we imprison kids in now must come crashing
down, and the world must be their classroom, the classroom a reflection
of their world. The two must work as one.
The purpose of our schools, then, must be to help our kids discover
who they are, their loves and hates, and the stance they are going to
take in the face of the world. It becomes our responsibility as teachers
to put them in situations where this testing can go on; to create for
them memorable experiences that they will carry with them like talis-
men and come back to touch a thousand times during the course of
their lives. I'm convinced, for example, that a student learns more
about himself and life generally in three days spent with an Aunt Arie
(who went no further than the fourth grade) than in four years of
high school English.
We've gotten everything mixed up. We saw a man in a factory say,
"I can guarantee that if you put piece A and piece B and piece C to-
gether according to this blueprint, you will get the following result, and
I can guarantee it will happen every time." We saw that, and it
seemed good.

============================================================
PAGE 11
============================================================

INTRODUCTION 
15
And so we took it to our schools. "Put text A and kit B and qualified
teacher C before the students of this land, and we can guarantee they
will all read at level D at the end of one year." We tried that, and it
was not good.
But now we cannot stop. We have substituted understanding Silas
Marner for understanding the communications (no matter what form
they may take) of others. We have substituted the dates of the Spanish
Armada's great battles for an understanding of history and how it
works and how the past affects the present. We have substituted the use
of clay molds of little figures and the copying of pretty pictures for
creativity in art. All in the style of technology. "These tools and these
ingredients and these instructions will yield these results. Follow them.
At the end, you will have a well-educated student, ready to think for
himself and take his place in society. This we can predict." And it does
not work. And we are reaping the harvest now.
We have ruled out the possibility of anything worth while, new, or
creative coming out of random behavior, play, or the testing out of a
kid's own ideas in any area from art through zoology. And so we have
eliminated those activities. And we expect our kids to learn from their
mistakes.
We have ruled out the possibility of a student's being able to make
competent decisions regarding his life, his environment, his conduct—
even his bed time—so we make those decisions for him. And we expect
him to be able to walk out of our schools self-confident, ready to make
competent decisions regarding his life, his environment, his con-
duct . . .
We have separated him from his world—have made it irrelevant
to our tidy curricula—and yet we count on him to know what to do
with that same world, and have creative solutions for its problems,
when our time with him is done. Amazing.
And third, I'm afraid we've become a nation of nomads with no
sense of that security or serenity that comes from being able to say,
"Here is where I belong. Here is my place, my time, my home, my
birthright, my community. Here I am loved and known, and here I
love in turn."
It happens all around us. Foxfire has had four different editors at
Doubleday. The first three have left, one by one. It happened to me
personally. My mother was from Poughkeepsie, New York; my father
from Marietta, Ohio; my stepmother from Washington, Pennsylvania.
I was born in Wheeling, West Virginia; raised in Athens, Georgia;
educated in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, Ithaca, New York, and Balti-

more, Maryland; and I now work in Rabun Gap, Georgia. I've
learned a lot from all of that, but still I have no more idea of where I
fit in space and time and community than if I had just landed inside
a meteor from Pluto. I make my home where I am.
And it happens to my students. Over half of them move away per-
manently. They are giving this county away. Our tax assessors are all
land developers from outside the area. Parents have no family left to
sell the farms to, so they sell them off and watch "second home" ex-
travaganzas take their places. Kentucky Fried Chicken is proud to an-
nounce its arrival . . .
The only way I can see to get our kids committed to our neighbor-
hoods and our communities is to get them so involved in their sur-
roundings that they become determined that the community's destiny
will be in their hands, not in the hands of commercial rapists. They
must feel that they are essential to the future of their homes. The
alternative is to watch them leave, creating a vacuum filled, in our
county's case, by ten thousand summer lots all priced so high that even
if those kids wanted to come back someday they couldn't afford to.
Until we put together the article on shuckings and house raisings
(in this volume), none of us realized the extent to which people used
to be dependent on and responsible for each other. We knew that
once there were shuckings, but these sounded somehow remote—curi-
osities of a long-gone day. Now that we've done some real work on the
subject, I realize how widespread and pervasive and varied and com-
mon these practices were. They were a part of everyone's existence
here—and they were a constant part—not a once-a-month rarity.
Somewhere along the way, we've lost something fine. Perhaps in
our search for personal satisfaction and pleasure, we've dug so deeply
into ourselves that we've forgotten each other. The extent to which
neighbors are strangers is frightening, and the extent to which we've
blocked out and structured and programmed most of our time for our-
selves may be tragic. It may mean that we truly have lost our sense of
community, and in the process killed our interdependence forever.
It's a mad cycle. We get jobs to support our families. They take our
time. Our time gone, we do less together. We see our neighbors less
and less frequently, and a gulf is formed. With the loss of contact
comes loss of friendship, and with the loss of friendship/dependence
comes hesitance at reopening the contact (you have to work at being
friends), and with the hesitance comes suspicion. We read about crime
and dope and . . . I wonder if . . . ?
Soon we are a community of isolated islands ("Who are those people
who iust moved in?" I don't know. We ought to go find out some-

day.") and the damage is done. We need only look at a friendship
quilt (The Foxfire Book, page 143) to see how great the loss.
Now I'm not suggesting that everyone should suddenly get together
and have a pea thrashing. A barn raising in the middle of suburbia is
likewise farfetched. But as our leisure time increases, and as we search
for new ways to fill it, surely we are inventive enough to be able to
find ways to work/play/create together as communities.
There are a few hopeful, tentative signs. Community-wide trash
cleanups, for example. Or neighborhood parks and recreation areas
built and designed for the community by the community. Or food
cooperatives. But they are often tentative, groping, short-lived.
Too often we fail to see any common bonds between ourselves. May-
be if we set about with our kids creating some fertile ground for those
bonds, we'll find how close our interests and our instincts and our needs
as human beings really are. And maybe we'll find again the rich wis-
dom in that sense of shared responsibility and love that once existed.
Until that time, we may have to resign ourselves to a world where
our kids flee home leaving their parents behind: lonely, embittered,
bewildered islands on a whole wide street full of people.
As I said, I'm far from having all the answers for myself or anyone
else. But those things I believe. They are the platforms from which I
work in Rabun Gap. I am convinced that we, as adults, must con-
stantly cling to, affirm, and celebrate with our kids those things we
love: sunsets, laughter, the taste of a good meal, the warmth of a
hickory fire shared by real friends, the joy of discovery and accomplish-
ment, empathy with the Aunt Aries and their triumphs and sorrows,
the constant surprises of life; and we must hope that, as teachers, in
the process of that celebration and that empathy, we will build in our
students' souls such a reservoir of warmth and hope and generosity and
energy and self-assurance that it would carry them through hell. That
is surely what those who do not have that reservoir will face.
Foxfire is one means I have stumbled upon to help with that build-
ing. It is not enough by itself. There are hundreds of other ways. But
with Myles Horton in mind, it is the way I have chosen, for me, for
now. It isn't going to work for all my kids, but I believe it's worked
for some; and I'm constantly revising to make it work for more.
And I have to believe that if a man is doing that, then, though
cicadas ring forever in his ears, he may not be praised, but he at least
will not be damned; for he is doing everything he can in his small
Part of the globe to help, in his small way, to set things right.

MAUDE SHOPE
aude Shope is one of our
newest contacts. She was
born in North Carolina
within seven miles of where she lives now, and she steps right out of
an age that is long gone. She's been to corn shuckings ("Oh, that
was a big thing, y'know; goin' to shuck out a man's corn"), log roll-
ings, has spun wool, sewed clothing, raised twelve children, done mid-
wife work, walked to church and school—and a thousand other things;
even at the age of seventy-six, she hasn't slowed down much. And
neither has her thirty-two-year-old mule, Frank. When she claimed
she still rode him, we looked at her in disbelief, I guess. So she
proved it, as the photographs show.
When she's not being visited by family, or visiting with her grand-
daughter (who attends Western Carolina University) and her son-in-
law who live just up the dirt road, she stays alone in a tiny frame
house.
The grass hasn't grown greener up at Maude's, and she has never
won any world titles or medals, but if there were ever one to be recog-
nized for just plain, simple, old-fashioned ways, Maude would surely
be a prime candidate. She lives rough, but she has pride, dignity,
warmth, a joy and enthusiasm for life that is boundless. And she has
our respect and affection.

th'things that children's got now, but we didn't have'em and we didn't
look fer'em. When we'uz children, we'd all get out'n'play, y'know. In-
stead of a horse, we used t'have a stick and ride that around. As fer
dolls, oh, had one doll apiece in our life. And we thought we'd got
somethin'. We saved eggs and bought our dolls—give a quarter
apiece fer'em. And Mama made'em dresses th'next mornin'. Well,
that'uz worth more than a ten dollar doll would be now.
We thought Santa Claus, up t'when we was great big young'uns,
brought us stuff. I know one Christmas, we couldn't wait, hardly.
And they wouldn't let us get into things, and we felt of th'stockin's
we'd hung up. Oh, we didn't know what was in'em, and we couldn't
get into'em till just before daylight.

And we used t'walk t'school. Now, y'know, grownups and children
don't have t'walk as fer as from here t'th'creek hardly. Now we used
t'go and stay all night with our neighbor's boys and girls when we'uz
children. Mama'd let us go, and we thought it was th'greatest thing
there was, y'know—git t'go t'somebody's house and stay all night. And
us and them children'd play—oh, we thought we had th'biggest time.
We'd git into this sandy place—old gray sand. If we could git into that
sandy place, we was havin' our fun!
And I did farmwork and housework. Went t'th'field and worked in
th'field all m'life since I was a child. I always fed th'cattle an'stock.
T'tell th'truth, I'd rather work in th'field than t'work in th'house. I
like t'see a purty, clean house, but I'm not too good a housekeeper.
[The subject of children led us naturally into a discussion of how
children should be raised now, and what advice she would give them,
if she had the chance, to help them deal with today's world.] Well,
I don't know. Th'first thing is t'be honest and truthful. That's about
th'best thing I could think of. Live their life; be honest and truthful
and not steal. That's honesty, y'know. If you're honest and truthful,
you're not a'gonna' steal.

call right now, 'So-o-o-o cow!' and they'd three or four of'em bawl at th'same

Now I've heard, and you have too, heard people say, "I'd starve be-
fore I'd steal." Well, I don't think I would. I think if I couldn't do no
other way, I'd slip me a bite a'somethin'. What I mean is, they's not
many people has t'steal anything. You can get somethin' t'eat without
stealin'. That's one thing, young'uns, you can take down. I'm not
a'gonna' steal if I can get by it. I won't steal a thing. I won't lie t'you,
and I won't steal. I say bad words sometimes—I don't deny it. I say
nasty words sometimes, and cuss sometimes. I've done that. But

stealin'r'lyin' to y', I'm not a'gonna' do it. I think that is a dirty thing
t'do. I believe in bein' honest—tellin' th'truth. That's th'way I feel.
I don't live like I should. I one time belonged to th'church and
prayed in public. I don't no more. I try t'live right, but still I don't
live like I should, not as good as I should live. At one time, I was
counted as good as anybody in th'church. But th'feelin' is just as im-
portant [as praying in public]. I don't git down on m'knees and pray,
but in my mind I pray, and I do believe that there's a higher power
than us. I do believe that. I can't say that there's not. [God shows
himself.] He's got control of—like this mornin'. It'uz as cloudy as it
could be, and we all said it'uz gonna' rain; and God done it, I sup-
pose. We didn't. And it cleared off, and now it's a purty day. He's got
His ways.
I don't read th'Bible a lot. I don't read it like I should. It's very im-
portant, though. I'd be afraid t'give th'Bible a lie or somethin'; I cer-
tainly would. I'll tell y'one thing I don't like—th'way they drag it
around. I like th'old Bible better than I do this new style they've got
now. I don't know if that's contradictin' th'Bible or not, but I don't
think so. They change and try t'tell different things, but I'd be afraid
t'try t'contradict some a'God's things in th'Bible.
I feel like I'm a Christian, and all that; but still, I'll break over and
say nasty words, and I think it's a habit more'n anything. Just shore as
somethin' goes wrong, I'll say, "Well, dammit." And I don't mean a
bit more than—it's just habit. Just like you'll say little oF—like, "dad-
burnit," or somethin'r'nother. I think it's just as dirty as savin'
th'other. So I don't think that a body's doin' th'wrong thing. Well, of
course they're doin' th'wrong thing in one way, but show me one that
don't do somethin' wrong. There's nobody but what does somethin'
wrong. They might think they was doin' it right, but I might see it
[another way]. It's just your way a'seein'. I might see that they was
doin' awful dirty, and they might think they was bein' honest with
ever'thin' they done.
[That's why] I feel like I can't tell you [young people what to do].
You're gonna' do as you please. But I could tell you what I thought
was best. I'll tell you one thing I don't believe in. All right: if you was
courtin' a boy, maybe I'd just hate him. Well, and I wouldn't have
that boy if it was me. But it's you talkin' to'im, and you've got your
feelin's, haven't you? You're gonna' do what you think is right, either
way- It might be somebody I just hated. You've seen people thataway.
But I don't believe in tellin' you what t'do. You do th'best you can,

============================================================

PLATE 5
and do what you think is right. People say, "Well, if I'uz her, I
wouldn't marry him." Well, they're not a'gonna have t'live with'im.
It's you that's a'marryin'im. I believe in tendin' to your own business
and leavin' other people alone. If you tend to your own business,
you've got plenty t'do without a'tendin' t'mine and hers. Not t'say I'm
perfect'r'anything.
My parents was good about lettin' us make up our own minds .They
was good t'us. They was strict about makin' us mind, but they was
good. Had a Christian mother and father all my life. We worked.
Didn't work like slaves—I don't mean that. But we had t'work for our
Iivin'. And they didn't 'strict us t'havin' t'belong t'th'church that they
b'longed to ner nothin'. We had our privilege. They was Methodist—
both of'em—and I'm a Methodist. But if we'd a'wanted t'been Bap-
tists, they wouldn't've objected. Same way with politics. They were all
Democrats, but if we'd a'wanted t'be somethin' else, they wouldn't've
fussed on us.
[But they were too restrictive in one way, she felt.] But grown
people wouldn't've talked about havin' babies'n'such as'at a bit more'n
you'd go out here and shoot somebody. My gosh, we'uz taught up till
we'uz great big kids [that] th'doctor brought th'little babies all th'time.
We didn't know. When I'uz a great big girl, I didn't know no more
about sex than a dog does. And little calves- we thought cows
scratched'em out from under a stump or log out there till we was great

big children. That's th'way I'uz brought up. Not you know [about
sex] from th'time you're born, nearly. I believe it's better t'let children
know. If y'know somethin', you're not as apt t'do somethin' wrong as
vou would if you didn't know it was th'wrong thing t'do. Years ago,
v'know, if somethin' happened then, it was awful. But now it ain't so
awful. Well, th'girls know how to behave theirselves. I think girls
ought t'know what t'do and what not t'do.
And like it is by dressin'. Years back, well, if a woman had her dress
up and somebody seen her knee, awfullest thing ever was. But now
they don't pay no more attention for their knee than they do for their
hands. And so I don't know. It's just human nature.
Now when I first come to this creek, we broke up our land with a
mule and a single-footed plow. We made plenty of corn t'do us all
year long—never bought no corn when I first come t'this creek. Take
what we called a single-footed plow, break up th'ground and then go
and lay it off, cover it with a single-foot plow, drop it by hand. Now
it's changed so that my grandchildren couldn't build a fire in that
wood stove 'cause they don't know how. Well, I don't know how
t'drive a car, so I guess their way of doin' is just as good as mine. But
I like my way of doin' th'best.
When I come t'this creek, didn't know what buyin' meat and lard
was. They made their own meat and killed their hogs in th'fall of
PLATE 6

============================================================

FOXFIRE 2
th'year. You can remember your parents killin' hogs, and maybe they
still do yet, but they don't like they used to. Kill three or four big hogs,
or whatever you had, and take care of your meat and render out
th'lard, and have it and have lard t'do y\ But nowadays, th'younger
generation—they don't know how t'go and make it, and so all they
know t'do is go and buy. Well, it's like fixin' a meal. I can put me on a
pot a'green beans or shelled beans or whatever I got, and cook'em
here on th'fire. Nine times out of ten, nearly, they [the younger people]
stop at th'store and get some canned stuff and then come in and fix
their supper in a few minutes where it takes me all day t'cook a half
a pot a'beans.
I don't know which is th'best. I guess a wood stove's better for me.
It's old-fashioned, and I like it. With a 'lectric stove, you can heat one
of them, y'know, and have your meal ready before y'get your first fire
t'burnin' in that'n. But just for th'old-fashioned of it, I like it. And
then, it heats th'house. I like it for that. It's best for me t'do it th'old-
fashioned way, but then, I've got my way and they've got theirs.
But I think they oughta know how t'do this too. A person don't
know what might happen. They might get t'where they needed t'do
it and didn't know how. Like milkin' cows. They's not none of
th'younger generation knows how. Wouldn't know which side of
th'cow t'go to t'milk. Lots of y'don't. Well, I do. And I think because
I know it, some of th'young'uns quarrel at me. I know how t'do some-
thin', and I just think it's better t'know how t'do that work; and they
think it's better, a'course, t'do other work.
I just think ever'body's got his way of feelin'. You've got your way,
and if you think you're right a'doin' somethin', well, you're just as
honest as I am because you're doin' what you think is right.
Maybe there's somethin' I like t'eat, and you don't like it fer a thing
in this world. I'd say, "Oh, eat this. This is good. Eat it. Eat it. Eat."
Well, now, if you don't like it, you don't want t'eat it. I think that's
right in lettin' th'other man have his privilege.
Some people have superstitions, and that's their business too. You've
heard these old tales where if you dream a dream and tell it before
breakfast, it'll come t'pass? Or th'old sayin' on New Year's mornin'
that if a man comes t'your house first, you'll have good luck. If a
woman comes t'your house first, throw th'broom in front a'her 'fore
she comes in th'door or you'll have bad luck. That's an old sayin',
y'know. And not t'take th'ashes out between Christmas and New Year.
If you do, you'll have bad luck. Or eat black-eyed peas for New Year's
day? I seen a piece in th'papcr where someone was eatin' cabbage for

New Year. If I had cabbage any time through th'year, I'uz proud of
it.
And some believe if th'smoke's a'goin' t'th'ground, it's a'gonna'
rain. Or if it's clear fogs [fog without clouds accompanying it]
through th'month of January, then there'll be frost in May. Lots
a'people believes them, and that's their privilege. But I never pay no
'tention to'em.
[Changing the subject somewhat, we asked Maude what she con-
sidered her most valuable possession to be.] Water. That's important.
But that comes by th'Almighty. But it's our place t'get it.
I guess cattle and stock is actually th'most important t'me. They're
company. You take stock and them blamed old dogs—well, they're
company to a body. A dog usually comes ahead of anything else, don't
it? You know yourself that you'll hold up for your dog. If somebody
was t'come in and kick that dog just t'get t'kick him, I'd fly all mad in
spite of myself, I guess.
[As the interview ended, we asked her if anything really worried
her.] I'll tell you what I'm afraid of. You may live t'see it. I guess I'll
not. And that's that th'government will come and cut up our land—
[take it from] all that's got more than a certain amount. There's
s'many more people bein' born into th'world, y'know. Ain't no tellin'
how many more people they is now than they was forty and fifty years
ago. Well, they've got t'have a place t'live. We've got land here. In a
few years they'll cut it up and they'll take off so much and sell it. That
worries me. There's so many new houses put up down th'road in just
th'last little while.
I don't want no city life. I like country life better. I've never lived in
a city, but I don't want to. For one thing, if you're in th'city, it's a
noise all th'time. Back in th'country, you got your free runnin' water
and all such as that.
Why, I wouldn't swap this little shack here for th'finest house in
New York. I wouldn't do it. That's just th'way I feel.

SOURWOOD HONEY

ees are outstanding bota-
nists. They know instinc-
tively which plants provide
the most nectar, and will visit one plant species almost exclusively as
long as it is in blossom. In the Blue Ridge Mountains, the bees are
busy from the time of the first red maple blossoms in the spring
through the last of the ironweeds and asters in the late fall. But many
mountain dwellers will tell you that the very best honey comes from
the sourwood.
The sourwood tree, Oxydendrum arboreum, has been called one of
the world's best bee trees. It is a member of the heath family, Ericacae.
It may be a tall and stately tree, often an understory tree with dog-
wood in groves of oak and hickory, or it may be short and shrubby on
ridges or rock outcrops. It is found from the red clay hills of the Pied-
mont to mountain elevations of three thousand feet.
The sourwood has long, narrow, very glossy leaves. These have a
tart, sour taste, and they can be chewed as a thirst quencher. Some
botanists describe them as being bitter. They turn brilliantly scarlet in
early autumn and paint the hills and lower mountains with color. Me-
dicinally they are a diuretic. Gathered when red, "filled with sun
power," a grasp of sourwood leaves plus anvil dust made dropsy medi-
cine. They also yield a black dye.
The sourwood often has a curved or crooked trunk once prized for
Marie Mellinger, a local botanist, works with the Georgia Conservancy and as
a naturalist for the Georgia Slate Parks Department,

sled runners. The wood has been used for tool handles and bed posts.
The dark, roughly squared bark was also used for dye and medicine.
But a few say it is very bad luck to burn sourwood for fuel. This can
supposedly bring on bad weather or family disasters. A sourwood
limb cut to the exact height of an asthmatic child could be put under
the doorstep. When the child outgrew the length of the stick, his
asthma would be cured.
The sourwood tree, in early July, is covered with drooping racemes
of waxy white bell-shaped blossoms that perfume the air and call all
the honeybees in the neighborhood. Flowers are called "angel-fingers,"
and the sourwood is also known as "sorrel-tree" or "lily-of-the-valley
tree." The long blossoming period of the sourwood makes it a favorite
honey-producing tree. One mountain man said, "I never seen bees go
crazy like they do on sourwood." Bees will work at sourwood flowers
even in the rain and through most of the daylight hours. Stand under

SOURWOOD HONEY

a sourwood and you can hear the melodious hum of the bees in the
blossoms.
The honey is described as "larrupin' good," and a "man ain't tasted
nothin' lessen he's put his tongue to sourwood honey." Many people
still like the sourwood honey as well as do the bees. Maurice Brooks
wrote that "sourwood honey is yellow and just a touch of the oxalic
acid which the host plant contains comes through to give the sweet a
certain piquancy." Sourwood is extolled as "mountain honey thick
and raw, exactly as the bees made it."
In the mountains, honey was the preferred, "long sweetening" while
"short sweetening" was sorghum. A drink for hot summer haymaking
days was "switchell," made by mixing a half cup of honey and a half
cup of cider vinegar. This was kept in a jar and four teaspoons of the
mixture were added to a dipper of water for a nourishing drink.
Sourwood honey is credited with more virtues than just tasting
good. It has been called a natural stimulant with a pleasant acidulous
taste, very good for rheumatism and arthritis. It is often a main ingre-
dient in homemade cough medicines combined with wild cherry or
white pine, or as a stomach medicine with yellow-root and moonshine
whiskey. Sourwood honey plus flaxseed was used for whooping cough,
and sage, honey, and vinegar were combined for coughs or sore
throats. Honey and alum relieved hoarseness. Honey could also induce
sleep, help relieve fevers, or be applied to burns.
The production of sourwood honey has become a beekeeping indus-
try that brings thousands of dollars to mountain economy and supplies
honey to roadside tourist stands and grocery stores all over the moun-
tains.

BEEKEEPING
his has been one of those
maddeningly elusive top-
ics that we run into once
in a while. Four years ago, for example, we were told that Terrell
Lamb's old beegums were still set up in his field. When we checked it
out, though, we found that they had all disappeared. That began a
search for an old beegum still in use that just ended this year in Farish
Kilby's back yard over on Persimmon.
The same thing was true with bee trees. We finally located one, and
we had Lon Reid's assurance that he'd cut it with us this spring so
we could see how it was done; but he got sick and never was able
to complete the job. Mrs. Mellinger's companion article, meanwhile,
sat in our office for over a year while we followed one false lead after
another—or made contact with men who could add pieces to the
story, but never quite enough to complete it.
Now, however, with the help of people like Esco Pitts, Lawton
Brooks, Elb McClure, Farish Kilby, Lon Reid, and many others, we
think we've about got it. We still don't have those pictures of a tree be-
ing cut, but we're going to have to wait until next spring before we
can try again. Meanwhile, here's what we have so far.
BEEGUMS
In the early days of beekeeping, the hives were nothing more than

============================================================
PAGE 29
============================================================

PLATE 10 A hollow tree trunk used as a beegum.
twenty-four to thirty-inch long sections of hollow black gum trees—a
fact that has caused even modern hives in the mountains today to be
called "gums," "beegums," or "plank gums." Some peculiarity special
to the black gum almost invariably caused it to be hollow and thus per-
fect for hives (and, incidentally, for dripping lye for lye soap).
Hollow sections of the tree would be brought home and the inside
rounded out smooth and uniform with a long chisel. "Middleways" of
fhe gum, four holes would be bored—one at each point of the compass
and two sticks run horizontally through the gum at right angles to
each other. These sticks acted as supports from which the bees would
suspend their brood combs. The bees would automatically save the top
alf of the gum for their honey and would hang those combs from the
Plank lid, or "head," that was set over the top of the gum. The head
was often held in place by a stick run through two wooden eyes (visi-
ble in several of the following plates). Then a slanted, easily remova-
ble lid was usually set above the head to keep rain from running into
the gum.

============================================================
PAGE 30
============================================================

PLATE 11 
Farish Kilby's bee-
gums are of the earliest type. The
two arrows in the middle show
the ends of the crossed sticks that
pass through the middle of the
hollow gum. The arrow at the
bottom points out a bee about to
enter the gum. Note the wooden
eye at the top of the gum. It holds
the stick that clamps the head on.
PLATE 12 
Ed Ramey nails the base
onto a new gum. Note how the base ex-
tends beyond the entrance holes to pro-
vide a landing platform for the bees.
Beekeepers always set the gums on flat platforms raised well above
ground level. Small rocks could be set under one edge of the gum tilt-
ing it slightly so the bees could enter; or "V"-shaped notches were cut
into the bottom on one side to serve the same purpose. The platform
extended several inches beyond the entrance to provide a landing area.
These gums were so satisfactory that even when the early beekeepers
began using plank gums, they used the same "crossed-stick" design.
The hives were childishly simple to build, and they could be easily
"robbed"; one simply removed the slanted roof, eased the head up a
crack, slid a long-bladed knife in the crack and sliced the comb from
the head, removed the head, and cut out the honey.
There were some disadvantages, however, that became obvious
when the modern "supers" were introduced. One disadvantage was

============================================================
PAGE 31
============================================================

PLATES 13—15 
Lon Reid's plank gums are the next step in the evolution from
hollow tree trunks to modern supers. Lon's gums also have the wooden eyes for
holding the heads on tightly (13), and the crossed stick design (14). To make
sure the lids stay on, Lon piles rocks on most of them (15).

============================================================
PAGE 32
============================================================

36 
FOXFIRE 2
that since no comb foundations were provided for the bees, as in mod-
ern hives, the bees simply hung the combs in random fashion from the
gum head. Removal was a sloppy, sticky job that fractured the combs
and often drowned masses of bees. The honey thus removed was also
often cluttered with debris such as dead bees, eggs and larvae from the
brood chambers below, splinters of wood, ashes from the wads of
burning rags used to smoke the bees, and so on.
Another disadvantage was that there was no control over what type
of honey the bees collected. With supers, when the sourwood began to
bloom, the beekeeper could simply add a new, empty super, and he
could pretty much count on getting it filled with the almost colorless
sourwood honey. The honey collected in gums, however, represented
nectar from everything that had bloomed from spring to the time the
gum was robbed. It was dark in color and not as delicate in flavor.
Yet another disadvantage was that since the comb stayed in the
gums "from one robbin' to another"—i.e., twelve months—it was
tougher and older than that of the supers which were changed regu-
larly.
The gums sufficed, however, and it is a tribute to their usefulness
that people like Farish Kilby and Lon Reid still use them today.
BEE TREES
When the new gums were ready, the next step was finding a bee
tree. Sometimes one was stumbled across by accident out in the woods.
More often, however, beekeepers either found a watering place or set
out bait and then followed the bees home. For bait, Esco Pitts's father
used corn cobs soaked in honey. He would choose a spot somewhere in
the woods, chop out undergrowth and low-lying limbs to create a small
clearing (or just find a natural one), place the bait on a piece of bark
in the center of the clearing, and then sit down nearby to wait. In
short order, if bees were anywhere in the vicinity, one would find the
bait, fly back to the tree to tell the others, and soon have a supply line
set up from the bait to their tree. The bees would light, fill up, rise and
circle once or twice to gain altitude, and then head in a "bee-line" for
home. All one had to do then was note the direction and head that
way. As Esco said, "He'd course'em from that."
Often the bait was carried along and reset somewhere along the line
to check direction and to see whether or not the tree had been passed
yet.
Variations in style and bait abound. Some used a drop or two of

============================================================

sweet-smelling anise. Elb McClure used sugar water (one part sugar to
one part water) or pure comb honey. Lon Reid's father used corn
cobs soaked in salty water for bait, and Lon still keeps salt water near
his gums: "You put the salt on th'cobs and then put water, and they
suck th'salt out of th'cobs. There's not many folks, I guess, that know
that but they'll search for salt. I never did know what they done with
it. Daddy said they fed it t'th'young bees. I never do put much salt.
Liable t'get it too salty. I don't know, but they'll suck at it. They will.
They'll just cover them cobs up if y'put salt in'em."
Joe Kilby claims that some old-timers used to put corn cobs and dirt
in a bucket, urinate in it, and then leave it for a few days. When they
got back, the bees would be there. And Elb agrees, saying the old-
timers used to call that "stinkbait." At times, he adds, they would even
feed it to their bees in early spring before the honey flow started. Soon
after it started, however, "th'bees wouldn't fool with it."
Lawton Brooks used a different bait: "Well, now, t'make your bait
up, y'take a little honey and some vinegar and warm water, and stir it
up together—not too much—and then y'just go and get a bunch
a'leaves, or find y'a stump'r'somethin' out in a kindly open place in
th'woods. I bet y'a dollar I can put some out where you live in your
yard and have a bunch a'bees on it in five minutes. They'll come to it.
And then y'watch'em, and when one gets loaded, he'll make a cir-
cle'r'two, and then when he starts, he'll go just as straight t'his tree as
you can shoot a rifle. Then y'just go th'way he went, and y'just look
at th'trees when y'get out t'th'distance you think he went.
"I'll tell y'what I do when I think of it. I fix me a little can a'bait. I
generally keep a can wi'me in th'summertime in my car. And when I
fish, I put some out and get t'watchin' it.
I h best place—if you can find'em a'waterin', you can find their
tree 'cause they water at th'closest place to their tree. I went down
there m th'pasture one day and found some a'waterin', and they went
nght up across th'road and right in by a poplar tree. I sat there and,
Know you ain't high on that hill, son, 'cause you went into th'woods
too low down.' So I got my little ol'hatchet and went right down
th'road. At th'little ol'tree I turned up in th'woods and I looked
around a little bit—up three'r'four trees—and they'uz a big ol'dead
tree a' standin' up there on th'mountain, and he went straight for it. I
said, 'Oh, he's in that'un.' He was in a big ol'black oak that had a
bulge on it—looked like a maul. And they'uz a split place about that
big in it, and buddy, they was just a'fillin' it full goin' in and out. I
found it in ten minutes. It's still up there."

PLATES 16—18 
Lon found a bee tree for us, but we didn't have a chance to
cut it. In Plates 16 and 17, the arrows show where the hole is (the arrow in Plate
17 points out a bee entering the hole). In Plate 18, Lon and Merle, his grandson,
sit at the bottom of the tree watching the hole.
Joe Kilby often left his bait set up overnight. When he got back in
the morning, the supply line would be set up. Sometimes he would set
uP two bait locations—one a short distance from the other. When the
lines from each were established, one had simply to follow each to the
point where they intersected, and there would be the tree.
When the tree was located, a deep "X", " # " , or " / / / " was almost
always cut into the bark. Such a mark was understood by the whole

community as meaning that that particular tree was already someone's
property and thus should not be cut or interfered with. It rarely, if
ever, was. As Lawton said, "They ain't supposed to [bother your
tree]. Now they hardly ever do, but they's some people'll come in and
cut your tree. But if you hack three marks on it, it's supposed t'be
your tree. I started t'hack that'n I'uz talkin' about before, and them
little devils come out and they just run me wild. I hit that tree three
times. By th'time I done it, them woods was full'a bees zippin' around
my head, and I took off. I went back t'see about it, but I never did cut
that'n.
"I like t'hunt'em. If you ever got started t'huntin'em, you'd be
a'huntin'em all th'time. It's somethin' t'do."
The time when the tree was cut depended on several things. If the
beekeeper wanted the honey from the tree, he often waited until Sep-
tember to cut it. Then he could rob both honey and bees. This meant,
however, that he would have to feed the bees during the winter
months.
If he cared only about getting the bees themselves, he would cut the
tree in the spring (Elb always cut them in April, and Lawton always
cut his when the apple trees started blooming), get the bees, and give
them plenty of time to rebuild inside their new home.
On the day the tree was to be cut, the beekeeper would carry the
empty gum (and a tub if he wanted the honey) to the site. Then, us-
ing a crosscut saw or an axe, he would fell the tree—hole up if possible
—wait for the bees to settle—sometimes overnight—and then cut into
it. The bees, of course, would go crazy. Lots of smoke from burning
rags, pine needles, or dry locust bark helped somewhat, as did protec-
tive clothing; but, as Elb said, "You can just figger on gettin' stung."
The method of cutting into the tree varied. Sometimes the tree
split open when it fell, and it was easy to open it up even further. At
other times, it was more difficult.
Esco Pitts told us his father usually waited a short while until the
bees settled somewhat, then cut into the tree with an axe across the
grain both two feet above and two feet below the hole. Then he would
split with the grain and lift out a four-foot long, several-inch wide
slice of trunk. Usually it would be chaotic inside with broken comb,
drowned bees, and splintered wood. He would get out what honey he
could—splinters, dead bees and all—bring his gum over and set it up
on a platform beside the tree, find the queen in the brood chambers,
gently pick her up (other bees would immediately gather on that
hand I. and then shake her off in front of the new gum. Both she and

============================================================
PAGE 37
============================================================

BEEKEEPING 
41
the attendant bees would immediately crawl into it, and the others
from the tree would follow shortly.
If it was in the spring, he would then return that night or early the
next morning when all the bees were inside, put a sack over the gum or
plug up the hole so none could escape, and then carry it home and set
it up on its platform. If it was in the fall, he would leave it in the
woods until some cold fall morning when the bees were either sluggish
or hibernating, and take it home.
Elb McClure used almost exactly the same method, but instead of
picking up the queen, he would "herd" her toward the gum. He
stressed repeatedly the need to find the queen for "that's th'mother of
'em all," and the other bees would invariably join her in the gum. To
hold them there, he always cut out a slice of the brood comb or a large
chunk of honey and put it in their new home with them. At "dusky
dark" when all the bees were in, he'd plug the hole. The next morning
he'd haul it home and, with a little luck, the bees were his.
Farish Kilby, on the other hand, when cutting a tree open, would
cut three holes in a straight line about a foot apart each into the hol-
low, bee-filled area. The smoke was pumped into the upper hole, the
honey was removed from the middle hole, and the bees (who came out
the lower hole from the brood chamber) were urged into the waiting
gum.
Lawton had still another method: "You can guess about how far
that holler part goes. Saw it off up fer enough where y'know it ain't
holler. Then come back and shave off another little part and another,
and you can tell where it goes t'gettin' rotten just a'lookin' at it. When
it does, quit there.
"Then go down and start on th'other end and saw up that way till
it looks like it's gettin' rotten. You may not have a piece over that long
[arm's length], and you may have one eight foot long." Some, he con-
tinued, if the piece was short, would simply carry that home and set it
up as the gum. There was almost no way to get the honey out, though,
when you wanted to rob it. And sometimes the impact of the tree fall-
ing made such a mess of the comb inside that it was almost impossible
for the bees to rebuild.
SWARMS
Whenever a hive gets overcrowded, some of its bees set out in a
"swarm" with a queen to found a new hive. This often happens in

============================================================
PAGE 38
============================================================

42 
FOXFIRE 2
April and May, and if a beekeeper is alert, he can easily add another
gum to his holdings.
If the swarm was flying, old-timers in the mountains "settled" it in a
number of ways. Some beat on dishpans with wooden spoons or metal
forks, or rang cowbells to make them light. Esco Pitts thinks ihe rea-
son this worked so well is that the queen, he thinks, emits a high-
pitched noise to keep all the bees together. The ringing and clashing so
confuses them that they settle to regain their bearings. Esco himself
has often thrown handfuls of loose dirt in rapid succession both into
and in front of a flying swarm. He claims they light and settle im-
mediately.
Sometimes the swarm has already settled in a giant cluster when dis-
covered. Once Esco carried a swarm that had settled on a limb, limb
and all, several miles to his gums at home. Lon often carries a burlap
sack and a gum to the swarm, spreads out the sack, sets the gum on it,
and shakes the bees off their perch so that they land in front of the
gum and go in. "Once," he says, "they'uz some settled out yonder,
and I just shot th'limb smooth off with a rifle. But they flew back up
and settled on th'body of a little ol'simmon tree. I didn't have nothin'
but a ol'dull axe up there, and I wanted t'get'em down quick as I
could as I'uz afraid they'd leave me. I've lost several swarms. That
tree never did bear anyway, so I cut that just to where I could push it,
y'know, so it wouldn't fall hard; and part of'em fell off on
th'ground. They moved back up though. And I just spread out my
cloth, and after while I just took my hand and put my fingers close
t'gether, and I just raked'em off by th'handfuls by th'gum."
Lon apparently knows what he's doing. He has about sixty gums, all
full, and all of the bees in them have come either from bee trees in the
area or swarms that he has captured.
ROBBING
Bees were robbed at various times during the spring and summer.
The important thing, of course, was to leave enough honey for the bees
to get through the winter. If robbed in late spring, the beekeepers often
took almost all the honey that was there since the bees would have the
rest of the summer to replace what was taken. In the fall, those robbing
the hives would take only a small amount of that honey that was avail-
able.
Esco Pitts's father always robbed his bees at the new moon in June.
He had a long knife made from the blade of a broken crosscut saw. He

============================================================
PAGE 39
============================================================

BEEKEEPING 
43
would warm the blade in a fire, lift the head of his old-style gums up a
crack, slice the comb free of the head with the warmed blade, and
then take the head off. Then, taking another knife that had a right-an-
gled crook in the blade's end, he would reach in between the narrow
combs, slice them free at the crossed sticks and lift them out.
Farish Kilby sometimes robbed his hives three or four times a season,
drawing sixteen to twenty pounds of honey from each hive each sea-
son.
Elb McClure maintained that for him, it depended on what kind of
hive he had. If the hive was a gum, he'd rob it only once a year, in
June, since it took the bees so long to rebuild the comb. Combs in the
patent gums, however, could be rebuilt so quickly by the bees that they
could be robbed whenever they were full. Elb, for example, would usu-
ally rob the early, red honey in June. Then, when the "white honey
flow started around June 20," he would have the new super in place to
catch the sourwood honey.
The honey from the hives was usually packed, comb and all, into
cans or jars. Some was always saved for the family's use as sweetening
during the winter. The rest, if a market existed, could be sold to pro-
vide a little extra spending money for the family.
ENEMIES
Bees are subject to a host of diseases and natural enemies, all of
which mountain people responded to as best they knew how.
Some were harder to deal with than others. Skunks sometimes
parked themselves in front of hives and gobbled the bees whole as they
flew out. Bears were addicted to the honey. As Esco said, "A bear'll
sure rob a beehive. Their wool's s'thick a bee can't sting'em." And just
recently a bear overturned and destroyed a group of Elb's hives on
Patterson Gap. The only remedy they knew for that was to fence in the
hives.
Other natural enemies could be dealt with easily by a strong hive. A
weak one, however, was in trouble. Ants, bumblebees, or weevils, for
example, sometimes got in, attracted by the honey. Perhaps the worst
enemy was the wax moth. It laid eggs in the gum walls that produced
terribly destructive larvae. Almost the only thing that could be done
when that happened was to burn the gum, bees and all, to keep the
pest from spreading. If caught early enough, some mountain men
either poured scalding water over them or burned sulfur in a saucer

============================================================
PAGE 40
============================================================

44 
FOXFIRE 2
inside the gum. It killed the moths and bees both, but at least the gum
itself was saved.
Kenny Runion spent some time discussing the latter curse. In his
words: "There's what they call a weevil. He's about that long [half
inch] and he's a worm. And he gets in there and he goes to work. He
webs in there—looks like a spider web.
"Now he commences at th'top and goes down; and when he does
that, you just take that gum out and set it afire. He just puts that web
over there and th'honey sours. There's a miller causes it. That's a
miller—like you see flyin' around a light. He goes in there and lays
these eggs and this ol'worm, he'll hatch out. Then he'll go spin that
web. And there never have been nothin' that I know of ever invented
that would stop that. It's just a dead stand of bees when they hit.
"I've tried everything in th'world t'get shed of'em. I had a stand one
time like that, and I took a razor and cut every one a'them weevils out
of there. They had already went about half way runnin' th'bees out.
And I put th'lid back on and I said, 'By th'way, I've got you'uns
now!' In a month I looked back in there and it'uz as white as cotton.
Bees done dead. Killed'em.
"And you can scald that gum. You can burn it out. And you put
your bees in there and see how it'll be. Them weevils'll be back on
th'same bees. Yes, sir. I went back and looked and I said, 'Great good-
ness !' I just took it out and set it afire. Burnt th'honeybees and all. You
can't keep a miller out.
"Now when they get so far, there's another thing—what they call a
roach. You know what that is. An old, slick flat bug. That thing'll run
whenever you raise that lid. He goes with these weevils. And you can't
spray t'kill them things. If y'do, you'll kill your bees. He follers that
there worm outfit—them weevils. He may do part a'that webbin'.
Keep th'strands straight, y'know.
"Now they generally hit a weak stand a'bees. They can't do much
with a big stout stand. But now a weak stand is what they'll hit. And
they're gone. That web, hit's stout. And that thing—he's just a little
feller—he goes back'erds and for'erds that'a'way from one edge of
th'box t'th'other. When he gets that done, he starts toward th'bottom.
And when he gets through, them bees are shot. They're just took.
There's no way a'gettin' out."
Another problem described by Esco Pitts and Elb McClure was
something known as "foul brood"; so named because such a terrible
odor escaped when the lid of the gum was raised. The disease, the
cause of which was unknown, caused the young bees to die as soon as

============================================================

============================================================

45
they emerged from the combs. Esco suspects that it was even carried
on from one hive to another by swarms.
Again, the only remedy they knew was destruction. In Elb's words,
"Pour y'a little gas on'em and set'em afire."
CONCLUSION
Beyond all the above, there is a multitude of brief hints and thoughts
and ideas and superstitions that come from a lifetime of handling bees.
A sampling:
—Bees sense when a human is afraid of them and will sting. Never
fight or swat when approaching a hive or surrounded by bees. Stay
calm and unruffled.
—If stung, don't grasp the stinger and pull it out. Often a poison
sac is left behind at the base of the stinger, and grasping it squirts the
rest of the poison into the skin. Take the blade of a knife and scrape
the stinger out.
—Insecticides kill bees as well as other insects. If corn is sprayed
while in bloom, bees visiting the flowers will die.
—Bee venom eases the pain of rheumatism and arthritis. Esco Pitts,
when in pain from arthritis, would often get stung on purpose with
good results. As he said, "I never had arthritis as long as I fooled
wi'bees." Elb McClure agreed.
—Beeswax is perfect for waxing thread for quilting or sewing
clothes. And Esco's father, who made shoes, sewed them with flax
thread that had been coated with beeswax from their hives.
—The best honey ever produced, according to many we talked to,
was that which came from the blossom of the old, now extinct, moun-
tain chestnut.
Along with the hints and thoughts comes a natural awe at the
way bees work and thrive. Lawton Brooks: "They've got bees 'at
guards; they've got bees 'at carries water, and they got bees 'at makes
honey. Then they got bees in'ere 'at cools their honey. They all got cer-
tain jobs. And they do their own jobs. One bee won't carry a load
a'honey now and do somethin' else next. They got different bees to do
what there is t'do to a gum.
"Now that's a funny thing. They got more sense than people think
they do. Just like me and you goes on a job, and they put you t'doin'
one thing and me another'n, and they're expectin' you t'do your job
and not mine. Them bees is th'same way. They've got guards that

============================================================
PAGE 42
============================================================

46 
FOXFIRE 2
don't do nothin' but go 'round and 'round that hole there and just
watch 'at. If a ant or anything starts in, they grab it. They guard it all
th'time. And they'll guard [against] you too. You get around there
and they'll pop th'stinger to y'.
"And they've got'em in there that cools th'honey. You can go of a
night and you can hear'em just 'wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o'—them wings just
a'goin'. You never heard such a noise at night. Specially of a hot night.
And when yer gums get full'a honey, you can go out there and listen of
a night and you've never heard such a sound in your life. God
A'mighty. 'Wo-o-o-o-o-o'—just like they'uz billions and billions of'em.
And they're a'coolin' that honey with them wings when they do that.
They're all fannin'.
"And it's funny, such a scent as they've got. They can smell any-
thing from miser'ble fur. You can put out a little bait here fer one
across up yonder, and he'll come right down to it.
"They're a sharp thing. You read about'em; they're a awful sharp
thing, a bee is."
Such awe is probably half the reason for keeping them in the first
place, and it is echoed again and again:
Lon Reid: "I like t'fool with bees. I've worked at these so much that
my shoulder'll hurt. I like t'work with'em though."
Esco Pitts: "They're an interesting thing t'study, a bee is."
Elb McClure: "Most interestin' thing you ever seen t'fool with."
We believe them. We're still going to follow someone, someday when
he goes out to cut a bee tree. If our photographers don't all get chased
off by angry bees, we'll have some photos for you soon. Come with us if
you like.

SPRING WILD PLANT FOODS
he forests and fields of the
mountains 
are 
literally
filled with edible leaves,
berries, and roots. Many of these have been used by the mountain
people for several generations. In pioneer days, the use of wild plants
to supplement the daily diet was a necessity, and many of the plants
used served as tonics or medicines as well. Nowadays, with the lure of
modern food markets, the use of many of the wild plants is a matter of
choice, rather than need. Many of our informants say, "My mother,
or my aunt, or my grandmother used that but we don't bother gather-
ing it."
There is a revival of interest in the wild plant foods, for many who
have migrated to the city are finding pleasure and good eating in re-
turning to the country on occasion and gathering wild greens or ber-
ries. Most of the wild plants have a high vitamin and mineral content,
and add greatly to the foods essential for good nutrition.
We began gathering information on this topic several years ago.
Though it is not a complete handbook or guide to the woods by any
means, it does reflect everything we have found so far; and everything
included here has been verified and rechecked with our native in-
formants (with the exception of those few recipes marked by an aster-
isk, which are recipes that came to us second-hand rather than di-
rectly from our mountain contacts).
In addition, we have enlisted for this chapter the invaluable aid of
Marie Mellinger, a local botanist, who checked all our plant speci-
mens, verified their botanical names and characteristics, tried almost

============================================================
PAGE 44
============================================================

FOXFIRE 2
every one of the recipes herself, and helped us compile all this into a
chapter that would make some sense and that you might use your-
selves. With her help, we've listed the plants according to their botani-
cal order. Mrs. Mellinger also found Carol Ruckdeschel for us, a bo-
tanical illustrator, who provided us with the pen-and-ink drawings.
For those of you who intend to try to find and use some of these
plants yourselves, we should emphasize that the plants named are those
traditionally used here in southern Appalachia. Although they may well
exist in your part of the country, you may need to consult a local plant
guide to make sure. And we would also urge you to avoid plants that
are becoming rare and on the verge of extinction in your areas. There
will be no problem with the vast majority of these—dandelion, for ex-
ample—but in this age of asphalt and summer home developments,
edible plants such as Indian cucumber, wild ginger, and wintergreen
have suffered terribly.
And we must issue a word of caution. John Evelyn wrote, "How
cautious then ought sallet gatherers be, lest they gather leaves of any
plant that do them ill." NEVER GATHER A PLANT UNLESS
YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT! Some plants are safe to use in
small quantities, for example, sheep sorrel (Rumex) and wood sorrel
(Oxalis), both rich in vitamin C. Overuse should be avoided because
of their high content of oxalic acid. Sometimes one part of a plant will
be safe to use, such as the stems of rhubarb, while the leaves must be
avoided. Some plants are safe only after cooking.
One mountain man told us that people used to follow the cows in
the spring of the year, to see what they would eat. This could be dan-
gerous, for cows are notoriously stupid, and will eat the plants that
cause milk-sickness, and such deadly things as wilted cherry leaves.
Most greens and salad plants used are in the mustard family and
composite family. Most of the plants of the mustard family used for
greens have a most characteristic mustardy smell and sharp pungent
taste. Most fruits and berries are in the rose or heath family. Plants
to be avoided are those of the parsnip family, for many resemble the
deadly cow parsnip, or water hemlock. Someone, sometime, must
have experimented, finding the edible plants by trial and possibly
fatal error. Now there is no necessity for that. Descriptions, drawings,
and photographs of the edible plants all help you to determine their
identity.
There is almost nothing better after a long winter (and remember,
most greens are best when young and tender) than a mess of dande-
lion, lamb's quarters, or cress. Absolutely nothing equals a dish of wild

SPRING TONIC TIME
After a long winter, spring was the time to refresh the spirit and
tone up the system with a tonic. The mountain people used teas as
beverages and as tonics. They would gather the roots or barks in the
proper season, dry them, store them in a dry place, and use them as
they wanted them. People used sugar, honey, or syrup to sweeten the
teas. Common spring tonics were sassafras, spicebush, and sweet birch.
Lovey Kelso told us, "We had to have sassafras tea, or spicewood, to
tone up the blood in spring, but I never cared for either."
Sassafras (Sassafras albidum) (family Lauraceae)
(white sassafras, root beer tree, ague tree, saloop)
Sassafras is usually a small tree, growing in clumps, in old fields and
at woods' edge. It is one of the first trees to appear on cut-over lands.
In the mountains, however, sassafras may grow to sixty feet tall. Twigs
and the bark of young trees are bright green, older bark becomes
crackled in appearance. Leaves are variable in shape, being oval, mit-
ten-shaped, or three-divided. Leaves, twigs, and bark are all aromatic.
The greenish-yellow, fragrant flowers appear in early spring and are

followed by deep blue berries. The so-called "red sassafras" is identi-
fied by some botanists as Sassafras albidum variety molle, and has soft
hairiness on the leaves and twigs. The recipes that follow can be used
with either variety.
Twigs, roots, or root bark are used for tea, candy, jelly, and flavor-
ings. Leaves are dried and used to thicken soups. Blossoms are also
boiled for tea.
Sassafras has a long history of use as food. It was one of the first
woods exported to England where it was sold as a panacea for all ills,
guaranteed to cure "quotidian and tertian agues, and lung fevers, to
cause good appetite, make sweet a stinking breath, help dropsy, com-
fort the liver and feeble stomach, good for stomach ulcers, skin trou-
bles, sore eyes, catarrh, dysentery, and gout." There was even a song
used to advertise sassafras: "In the spring of the year when the blood
is too thick, there is nothing so fine as a sassafras stick. It tones up the
liver and strengthens the heart, and to the whole system new life doth
impart."
In the mountains sassafras has always been used as a beverage and
a tonic. There is an old saying: "Drink sassafras during the month of
March, and you won't need a doctor all year." Sassafras was a blood
purifier and tonic and a "sweater-outer" of fevers. Red sassafras is
best, but as someone said, "Red is hard to get nowadays. The moun-
tains used to be full of it."
Sassafras is best gathered in the spring when the bark "slips" or
peels off easily. Florence Brooks told us, "Find a small bush, pull up
roots and all, or dig down by the base of a tree and cut off a few sec-
tions of root. Wash the roots and scrub until the bark is pink and
clean. Peel off the pinkish bark for tea." Mrs. Norton said that "some
claim the root is better but you can just use the branches." Big roots
should be "pounded to a pulp."
Fanny Lamb said, "Get some sassafras when the leaves are young
and tender, just eat leaves and all like you have seen the cows do. Eat
leaves and tender twigs and everything."
Alvin Lee wrote, "It's a remedy for colds, and for those down in the
dumps from a long winter. It's a spring tonic. 'Course some folks drink
it year around." Sassafras is supposed to be used on and after February
14. With golden seal and wild cherry, it makes a very potent tonic.
Sassafras tea: gather old field roots and tender limbs in March. Boil
roots and limbs and sweeten with sugar to taste. Or wash roots, beat to
a pulp with a hammer. Boil, strain, sweeten, and drink with ice. Or
put one cup shredded bark in quart of boiling water. Boil ten to twelve

minutes, strain, sweeten with honey or sugar. Or use one five-inch
piece of sassafras root one inch thick. Shave into two quarts water;
boil, adding sugar or honey. "Mighty tasty if stirred with a spicewood
stick."
Sassafras candy: grate bark, boil, strain, and pour into boiling
sugar; then let harden and break into small pieces.
Sassafras jelly: boil two cups strong sassafras tea and one package
powdered pectin. Add three cups strained honey. Strain and put in
jars. Jelly will thicken slowly.
The leaves of red sassafras make a good addition to candy and ic-
ings. Add one teaspoonful of dried and pulverized leaves to a kettle of
soup, or add one teaspoon of leaves to a warmed-up stew.
Spicebush (Lindera benzoin) (family Lauraceae)
(spicewood, feverbush, wild allspice, benjamin bush)

============================================================

FOXFIRE 2
Spicebush is a shrub growing six to sixteen feet high in rich woods,
ravine-covered forests, or on damp stream-sides. It has smooth green
stems and twigs, with a strong camphor-like smell. The leaves are me-
dium green, paler below, and fall early in autumn. Honey-yellow
flowers appear before the leaves in very early spring. In fall, the bush
bears bright red, or (rarely) yellow, aromatic berries.
Twigs and bark are used for tea. Berries can be used as a spice in
cooking. Spicebush is gathered in March when the bark slips. Mrs.
Norton told us, "You've heard tell of spicewood, haven't you? Well, it
grows on the branches [streams] and you get it, wash it, and break it
up in little pieces. It tastes better than sassafras; it ain't so strong."
Spicewood tea: "Get the twigs in spring and break 'em up and boil
'em and sweeten. A lot of people like that with cracklin' bread" (Mrs.
Hershel Keener). Or gather a bundle of spicewood twigs. Cover with
water in boiler. Boil fifteen to twenty minutes (or until water has be-
come colored). Strain, sweeten with honey, if desired, or add milk and
sugar after boiling. Especially good with fresh pork.
Spicewood seasoning: gather spicewood berries; dry and put in pep-
permill for seasoning.
Sweet Birch (Betula lent a) (family Corylaceae)
(black birch, cherry birch)
PLATE 22 Sweet birch
The sweet birch is a common tree in the deciduous forests of the
mountains, growing to ninety feet in rich ravines, along with tulip pop-
lar and red maple. Bark on young trees is a red-brown, but becomes
very crackled on old trees. The slender twigs smell like wintergreen.
Catkins appear before the leaves in very early spring. Leaves are oval,
tooth-edged, and deep green in color. Small seeds are eaten by many
species of birds.

Buds and twigs are favored "nibblers" for hikers in the mountains,
and will allay thirst. Twigs and root bark are used for tea, and trees
are tapped so sap can be used for sugar or birch beer. At one time,
the sweet birch provided oil for much of the wintergreen flavoring
used for candy, gum, and medicine. The inner bark is an emergency
food if you are lost in the woods, for it is rich in starch and sugar.
Sweet birch bark tastes quite good, and may easily be peeled off
to chew like chewing gum.
Sweet birch tea: cover a handful of young twigs with water; boil
and strain. Sweeten with sugar or honey. The birch is naturally sweet
so needs very little extra sweetening. Good hot or cold. Or bore a
hole half-inch thick into tree. Insert a topper or hollow toke of bark;
hang a bucket under end of toke to collect sap. Drink plain, hot or
cold.
Birch beer: Tap trees when sap is rising. Jug sap and throw in a
handful of shelled corn. Nature finishes the job.

FOXFIRE 2
The mushroom most commonly gathered in spring, and a delight to
eat, is the morel, Morchella. There are various signs to tell it is time
to go morel hunting, but usually you look for them after a warm rain,
when the dark blue violets bloom. A favorite place is under old apple
trees.
All are wrinkled and pitted, and a light oak-leaf brown color.
Avoid mushrooms having folds instead of pits. True morels are hol-
low. Morchella esculenta is found under old apple or pear trees when
oak leaves are mouse-ear size. Look for the fat morel, M. angusticeps,
in oak, beech, or maple forests when the service berry (Amelanchier)
is in bloom. M. crassipes is found in swampy ground, almost always
with jewelweed (Impatiens). These mushrooms are especially favored
by people of Pennsylvania Dutch descent. They consider them the best
of all edible mushrooms and use them in sauces, gravies, and soups.
Morels can be dried for winter use. Hang them strung on twine, with
a knot between each mushroom to keep them from touching. Hang
in a dry place. Before using dried morels, soak in milk to restore
freshness, or grind into mushroom powder.
Fried morels: soak in salt water. Slice crossways in rings. Dip in
egg and corn meal, and fry at medium low heat. Or put one pint of
morels in pan with egg-sized piece of butter. Sprinkle on salt and
pepper. When butter is almost absorbed, add fresh butter and enough
flour to thicken. Serve on toast or cornbread.
Stuffed morels: soak one-half hour in salt water; parboil lightly.
Stuff with finely chopped chicken or cracker crumbs and butter or
margarine. Bake at low heat for twenty minutes.
Merkel omelet: let stand in salt water one hour. Chop fine; mix
with eggs, salt and pepper, and fry in butter.
Merkel pie: cut in small pieces. Cover bottom of pie dish with
thin bits of bacon. Add layer of merkels, salt and pepper; then layer
of mashed potatoes. Put in layers of merkels and potatoes, finishing
with potatoes on top. Bake one-half hour.
SPRING GREENS
Before the days of vitamin pills and supermarkets, the first warm
spring days brought people out of doors to gather the new green leaves
of a group of plants known collectively as "potherbs," "greens,"
"garden sass," or "sallet." All of the wild greens offer much good
and nutritious food full of minerals and vitamins. It is necessary to
know and recognize these plants at an early stage of growth; they must
be catherwl while vrrv vmincr and tender, fnr thrv hfrnmc «trnnor and

bitter as they increase in size. Pick lots of very tiny leaves as greens
"cook down" considerably.
Some of the greens that are especially good are sheep sorrel, dan-
delion, poke, dock, lamb's quarters, and mustard. How do we know?
We've tried them, and they beat any spinach that comes canned or
frozen, or even fresh from the garden.
Asparagus (Asparagus officinale) (family Liliaceae)
(sparrowgrass)
Asparagus is a cultivated vegetable that frequently escapes and runs
wild along roadsides or in old fields, or persists around old farm
sites. The mature plant looks like a miniature evergreen, with needle-
like, finely appressed leaves. Small yellow lily-like blossoms appear on
the ends of the branches followed by bright red berries containing
the seeds. These seeds in ancient times were sometimes roasted as a
coffee substitute.

============================================================
PAGE 52
============================================================

PLATE 25 Teresa Tyler with asparagus.
The edible part of asparagus is a green-purple, thick shoot, used
before the leaves or branches appear. Pliny the Elder urged eating
them for good health, and they are equally valuable for good nutri-
tion today.
Asparagus is most flavorsome if cooked immediately after it is
gathered. A favored potherb, it should always be cooked in as short
a time and with as little water as possible. Add butter, or hard-
boiled egg and serve on cornbread, or add vinegar and olive oil,
salt and pepper, and put on parsley or chives, if desired.
Wild onion {Allium cernuum) (family Liliaceae)
(nodding wild onion)
This is a small plant with grass-like leaves, but with a strong
onion odor. It grows in colonies in grassy places, usually in open
fields or low spots. This wild onion has a nodding flower head with
white, cream, or bright rose-colored flowers. If often forms top bulbs.
Meadow onion {Allium canadense)
(meadow shallot, meadow garlic)
A small plant, the meadow onion measures eight to twenty-four
inches high, with flattened, grass-like leaves and star-shaped white
flowers. It also forms top bulbs. The whole plant has a strong onion
odor. It is found in meadows and open woods.

Allium canadense (meadow onion, left) 
and Allium cernuum
(wild onion, right).
The young leaves, bulbs, and top bulbs of both of these wild
onions are edible, and can be used in the recipes, either separately
or combined. Leaves and bulbs can be used to flavor soups, or top
bulbs can be pickled.
Wild onion sauce: gather wild onions and cress. Chop fine. Mix
with vinegar and a little sugar. Let stand several days before using.
Pickled onions: gather the little onions that form on the flowers.
Put in jar and cover with vinegar. Add spoonful of sugar. Let stand
several days before using.*
Fried onions: cut wild onions in pieces, dip in flour, fry in fat
until brown.
Ramps {Allium tricoccum) (family Liliaceae)
(wild leeks)
Ramps grow to twelve inches high, with broad, lily-like leaves.
They grow from a small, strong-scented bulb. After the leaves die
down, stalks of greenish-yellow flowers appear. Ramps grow in rich
woods, ravines and coves, usually under maple. There is a great deal

of disagreement as to their tastiness; it seems people either love them
or hate them. One gentleman said, "They's not for ladies or those who
court them."
Maude Shope said, "Ramps, well to tell you the truth, I've never
been where they've growed. They grow out here in these mountains.
But I've seen them; they've been brought here, a kind of onion -
natured thing, or garlic. A lot of people in the spring of the year,
they go crazy for a mess of ramps." And Harv Reid told us, "It
is a sort of wild onion. They just grow around in certain places. It is
sorta' dark where they grow, like around the little streams where they
come down. They grow up just like this little ol'onion they call multi-
plier onion. We used to gather them when we used to live back up
yonder. They is plenty of them here."

In a discussion on ramps:
Mrs. Norton: "I never could stand'em. I never did gather'em.
There was plenty of wild onions in there just a mile off, but you can
boil'em and they just nearly make you sick they're so strong. They say
ramps is lots worse."
Mr. Pennington: "I've had ramps from North Carolina; a friend
brought me some down one time and we ate'em for about a week.
I like'em."
Mrs. Norton: "Yeah, lots of people just love'em. They go ramp-
hunting every spring."
Mr. Pennington: "You know they have a festival up here for
them; it's a big deal up here."
Mrs. Norton: "Everybody goes out in the spring of the year and
hunts in these coves for ramps. Now you can smell'em all over here."
Fried ramps: parboil three minutes, drain, throw water away, add
more water, cook until tender, drain. Season in frying pan with
melted butter. Serve covered with bread crumbs. Or fry in grease
along with tuna fish and/or eggs, or add potatoes, salt, pepper for
flavor. Clifford Connor says, "Most important, go into solitary in
the woods somewheres, stay for two or three weeks, because nobody
can stand your breath after you've eat'em."
Ramp soup: cut one pound of beef in small pieces, add salt and
water, and boil. Skim. Add ramps, carrots, and potatoes cut in
small pieces. Take out meat and eat separately. Put vegetables through
sieve and serve hot. Or cook beef or venison and add celery leaves,
bay leaves, three cloves, and thirty-six ramps. Take meat out and
serve separately. Lift out ramps and serve broth with rice. Or add
fried ramps to beef stock. Season with black pepper and serve.
Ramp salad: chop up young leaves into tiny bits. Eat raw, or
cook and add vinegar when ready to eat. Or add a little to any salad;
or chop fine, parboil, drain and cool, and mix with mayonnaise and
serve with trout.
You can also add one-half cup chopped fine to mashed potatoes
just before serving.
Wild garlic (Allium vine ale) (family Liliaceae)
(wild onion)
Wild garlic is common in fields, along roadsides, and in lawns,
where it emits a strong odor when being cut. Leaves are slender,
round, and hollow. The wild garlic seldom flowers but when it does

it has pale pink or white flowers. Stems usually set top bulbs. This is
an evil-smelling weed, troublesome in pastures where it causes the
cows to give garlic-flavored milk.
All parts of wild garlic are edible, and said to be very good for you,
especially to ward off germs. If used at all, a little bit goes a very
long way. Gather tops in winter or very early spring when young and
tender.
Seasoning: wild garlic can be used fresh. It is sliced and put in
with food, especially meats, while they are cooking. To preserve, dry
the bulbs, powder, and store in closed container. Or grind the garlic
and mix with salt. Very powerful!
Garlic vinegar: peel garlic bulbs. Stand in one pint vinegar for
ten to fourteen days, tightly covered.
Nettles (Urtica dioica, U. chamaedryoides) (family Urticaceae)
Both species of nettle are very similar, with minor botanical dif-
ferences such as numbers of stinging hairs. Both are rather coarse
plants, growing to three feet tall, in rich woodland coves or along
streams and river bottoms. Stems are hollow, ringed with sharp,

needle-like hairs. Leaves are oval, toothed, and opposite on the stems.
Greenish flowers appear in the leaf axils.
The stinging hairs can cause a painful smarting, followed by a
red rash. Nettles were once used to cure scurvy, to treat gout and
ague, and for the "stings of venemous insects." Nettle greens are
rich in vitamins A and C, very high in protein, and make delicious
greens. They must be gathered with stout gloves. Repeated cookings,
pouring off the water each time, washes away the stinging hairs.
Nettle soup: gather plants in early spring. Cook a long time to
destroy the sting. Strain through colander. Add milk, chopped onion,
and black pepper. Or pull nettles out of ground. Cut pinkish shoots
that grow below surface. Cook in soup. Thicken with butter, flour,
and two egg yolks. Season with salt and pepper. Also add shoots to
chicken soup.*
Baked nettles: cook nettles a long time. Strain off liquid. Chop fine.
Add ground beef, rice, and seasoning. Bake at low heat until firm.
Dock {Rumex crispa) (family Polygonaceae)
(pike plant, curled dock, yellow dock, white dock)
Dock is a common weed that grows in fields, yards, and around
barns. It is about knee-high, and has leaves six to eight inches long.
Leaves have crinkled edges. Flowers appear in a green spike in May
and June, followed by seeds that turn dark brown and look like to-
bacco.

============================================================
PAGE 58
============================================================

PLATE 31 Dock
The closely related patience dock (R. patientia) and the speckled
dock (R. obtusifolius) are common in waste places. Patience dock has
reddish, or red-veined leaves, while speckled dock has narrow, spotted
leaves. Swamp dock (R. verticillatus) is found in very wet, swampy
places. The leaves of all dock species are edible when very young and
tender. They are very rich in vitamins A and C. The long yellow roots
of dock are used for medicine, boiled into tea and used as a bitter
tonic. Dock greens eaten in spring will thin and purify the blood.
Cooked with meat, dock leaves are said to make the meat cook more
rapidly. Seeds can be munched for a snack.
Greens: leaves of dock are sometimes cooked by themselves, but
more often in combination with other leaves, such as horseradish,
mustard, or turnip greens. Wash thoroughly. Parboil until leaves
turn a lighter green. Pour off water, wash two or three times. Then
either fry in hot grease and salt for three to five minutes, or bring
to a boil in fresh water, season and serve.
Hot greens on toast: to one pint of cooked dock, add one table-
spoon chopped onion, two tablespoons horseradish, and one cup sour
cream or a little vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve on toast
and top with fried bacon.*
Stewed dock: to several cups of cooked dock, add two cups to-
matoes, and onions browned in fat. Simmer and serve. Top with
cheese, if desired.

in the Piedmont. Sheep sorrel leaves were once used to bind up boils
or carbuncles. Leaves are edible and rich in vitamin C but should be
used sparingly after they are more than several inches long. Sorrel
leaves are used as a potherb, as a sauce, and mixed with other greens
in salads.
Sorrel soup: one pound bruised leaves, one-fourth cup butter or
margarine, two egg yolks, dash of salt and pepper, one-half cup
chopped onion, one cup cream, three cups chicken broth. Chop sorrel
and onion together (or ramps, if available), simmer in butter until
wilted, add eggs and cream. Bring to a quick boil. Serve.*
Or dice three potatoes and one onion. Fry lightly in fat. Chop one
handful of sorrel, lamb's quarters, and creases. Combine. Cover with

Rhubarb is a cultivated plant that will persist for years around old
house or garden sites. It has ribbed stems, red or bright green in
color, topped by large, broad, deep green leaves. Leaves are said to be
poisonous. Flowers are white in terminal racemes. The stalks are
gathered in early spring and cooked into sauce, or used for pies or
conserves. RHUBARB IS INEDIBLE, RAW!
A dried rhubarb root on a string around your neck will ward off

roots are bright red. Flowers and seeds appear in a green spike. Green
pigweed (A. viridis) and spiny amaranth (A. spinosus) are also com-
mon in waste places. Green pigweed has green stems and roots, and
spiny amaranth has spines at the bases of the leaves. Pigweed has a
very mild flavor. Young leaves of pigweed are delicious cooked alone,
or mixed with stronger mustardy greens. Wash, cook lightly, drain,
and add butter, salt, pepper, and a dash of vinegar. Or cook like
turnip greens with fatback. In ancient times, pigweed seeds were
gathered and cooked into mush, or sprinkled on rolls instead of poppy
seeds.
Lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album) (family Chenopodiaceae)
(goosefoot, pigweed, wild spinach, fat-hen, frost-blight, bacon-
weed, white goosefoot, mealweed, meldweed)
This is a two-to-six-foot annual weed, a native of Europe, common
in waste places. Stems are succulent and ridged, sometimes red or
purplish in color. Leaves are scalloped and frosted blue-green, or
rarely red-tinged. Flowers are greenish and insignificant.
Good king henry {Chenopodium bonus-henricus), also known
as blitum, smiddy, or markery, is sometimes cultivated as a potherb,
and has become naturalized in many places. It is very similar to
lamb's quarters in appearance, but reddish in color. Leaves are very
mealy.

to spinach in texture and taste, and like spinach very rich in iron and
potassium. The whole plant can be used if it is under six inches high,
or just the leaves picked from older plants. In Europe at one time,
seeds were ground into meal, or used on top of rolls.
Lamb's quarter greens: cook in a little water. Drain off water and
cover with white sauce made of flour, milk, salt, and pepper. Add
lemon and butter, or bacon bits and vinegar, if preferred. Or gather
one gallon greens (lamb's quarters and dock), wash and boil for ten
minutes. Drain and add one cup water and four tablespoons grease.
Cook covered until tender. If preferred, cook with a streak of fat and

PLATE 36 Poke, young....
PLATE 37 Poke, mature
ALTHOUGH THE BERRIES LOOK VERY PRETTY, THEY
ARE SAID TO BE POISONOUS AND SHOULD NOT BE
EATEN. Pokeweed shoots are edible when very young and ten-
der but should be avoided when stems become red and plant is over
a foot high. Berries were once used for ink or dye. ROOTS ARE
ALSO POISONOUS AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED.
Poke shoots resemble asparagus. They are probably eaten more
frequently than any other wild food in the mountain area. Dr.
Neville said to be sure to eat at least one mess of poke each spring. It
was "worth all the medicine you could buy. Don't eat poke sallet
raw; if you do, you'll get poisoned. The antidote is to drink lots of
vinegar which will kill the poison, and eat about a pound of lard. Poke
sallet eaten in the spring revives the blood."
Dr. Dover said, "Anybody that gets sick from eating poke, I'll treat
them free."
Mrs. Carrie Dixon said, "Poke sallet is the best spring tonic you can
find. My ma used to send us young'uns looking for it as soon as the
frogs started croaking in spring."
Poke is rich in iron and vitamin C. Pansey Slappey writes that "it
is rich in iron from the red clay of Georgia, but also has phosphorous
and other minerals."
Mrs. John Hopper doesn't like poke. "It's just not one of those
things that I eat. People'll tell you without a seasoning it'll kill you,
but it won't do it, 'cause Miss Hambidge never eats seasoning on
anything and she eats it. It ain't never killed her. The berries won't

whip her little kid because it wet the bed, and they told her to make
it eat ten pokeberries every day for ten days, but I don't know what
success she had. I'm not whipping anybody and making them eat
pokeberries."
Poke greens: collect tender young shoots of poke six to eight inches
high, in the spring. Do not cut below surface of ground as root is
poisonous. Wash and cook leaves and stems together, parboiling two
times (pouring off water each time after boiling a few minutes). Boil
in third water until tender, salting to taste. Drain and top with slices
of hard-boiled egg. Or put three tablespoons grease in iron fry pan,
add salt. Fry greens. You can scramble three eggs in it, or cook with a
streak o'fat and streak o'lean. Or add little spring green onions. Or
add pepper sauce or apple vinegar.
Poke sallet: put greens in a boiler of cold water; wash two or three
times. Drain off all the water. Fry in pan of hot grease. Add half
teaspoon of salt. Let cool. Beat two eggs and stir in after greens have
cooled. Serve with vinegar or pickle juice.
Fried poke stalks: cut whole poke plant off level with ground when
young (four to seven inches high). Wash. Slice like okra. Roll in a
mixture of salt, pepper, flour. Fry in grease until brown on outside
and tender on inside.
Poke soup: take leaves and stalks when about six inches high. Boil,
adding meat gravy and a little corn meal to thicken, until tender.
Poke-tuna roll: spread cooked poke leaves flat; put tuna fish along
middle. Roll leaves to enclose the tuna fish.
Poke pickles: collect very young stalks, scrape, remove leaves, and
pack in jars. Combine one cup vinegar, half cup sugar, one tablespoon
salt, one stick cinnamon, several whole cloves. Boil, pour over poke,
and seal.
Pokeberry wine: [While many people believe pokeberries are poi-
sonous, Mrs. Carrie Dixon swears the wine is good medicine for
rheumatism.] Gather ripe pokeberries, wash, and place in crock.

eight inches high, with weak stems, and succulent, bright green
leaves. Flowers are small, white, and star-shaped.
The whole plant is edible before flowering, and a good source of
vitamin C in winter time. It can be used as a potherb, or in salads,
or in soup instead of okra. It is good mixed with sheep sorrel, or
peppergrass, or more sharply flavored plants. It was once believed to
be a medicine to heal and soothe cancers.
The closely related mouse-ear (Cerastium) is also edible, but less
flavorsome as the whole plant is covered with woolly hairs.
Creamed chickweed: parboil, strain, chop fine. Reheat with milk,
butter, salt, and pepper.

FOXFIRE 2
Peppergrass is an annual weed, naturalized from Europe, and
common in waste places. It grows to twenty inches tall with branched
stems and small leaves. Tiny white flowers are followed by flat,
peppery seed capsules. Young leaves are used in greens or raw in
salads, and the seeds as a substitute for pepper.
Garden cress, or tongue grass {Lepidium sativum), is sometimes
planted in gardens, and escapes or runs wild. It has bright green, very
peppery leaves, and round flat peppery pods. Seeds of both cresses
can be ground and mixed with vinegar and flour as a substitute for
mustard.
Greens: peppergrass is good with poke salad. It is not quite as
tender as poke salad, and must be cooked five to seven minutes, when
used in combination. Or mix it with other greens such as dandelions,
lamb's quarters, mouse-ear (chickweed), dock, or wild lettuce. Just
cook peppergrass like cresses or turnip greens.

Peppergrass sauce: mix seeds with vinegar and a little salt. Use as a
sauce on fish.
Pepper substitute: "You know the wild pepper plant? It blooms and
has seed on it, just like little seeds in the pod of peppers, and you use
that for seasoning." Use in salads or on tomatoes (Mrs. Mann
Norton).
Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) (family Cruciferae)
(mother's heart, caseweed, St. James wort, poor man's pepper,
topwort, clapper)
Shepherd's purse is another common annual weed, growing to
eighteen inches high. Flowers are white and followed by flat, heart-
shaped seed capsules.
The young leaves can be cooked and added to salads; or the seeds
used in salads, or ground and mixed with vinegar as a substitute for
mustard. Use in the same manner as peppergrass in any of the same
recipes.
Juice of shepherd's purse on a piece of cotton will stop a nosebleed.
Wild radish (Raphanus rhaphanistrum) (family Cruciferae)
Wild radish grows to five feet high and is found in waste places.
Leaves are coarsely toothed. Flowers are white or pale violet or
yellowish with darker veins. Seeds are in a jointed pod.
Young leaves are used in salads with cooked greens, or in meat
sauce. Young pods are cut up in salads.
Mustards
All of the mustards can be lumped together in terms of edibility, and
any of them can be used in any of the recipes. Cultivated collards,
turnip greens, and cultivated mustard varieties can escape or natu-
ralize and grow wild in old garden spots. All these members of the
mustard family are characterized by having flowers with four cross-
like petals, and a smarting taste. All of the mustards contain vitamins
A, B, B-2, and C, and minerals very important to health. Leaves of
all should be gathered when plants are very young and tender. Their
pungent odor will identify the plants at once. Most of them are best
if first cooking water is drained off. They are good "blood purifiers"
and much-favored spring tonics.

White mustard (Brassica hirta) (family Cruciferae)
(pale mustard, kedlick)
An erect, winter annual, occurring in cultivated fields and low
places, white mustard is a native of Europe naturalized in this country.
Leaves are rough, hairy, and greatly dissected. Pale yellow flowers are
followed by bristly seed pods. Rich in vitamin C and sulfur, young
leaves are used in salads, greens, and in sandwiches, and seeds ground
up for mustard or mustard sauce.
Black mustard (Brassica nigra)
(warlock)
This is another native of Europe, very weedy in cultivated fields.
Leaves are large and very coarse, and strongly flavored. Clusters of
four-petaled flowers are bright yellow. Leaves are edible when very
young and tender. Seeds, when mature, are ground for prepared
mustard. In olden days, black mustard was used in love potions to
overcome lassitude in females.
Indian mustard {Brassica juncea)
(Chinese mustard)

This mustard is very similar to white mustard, but the leaves are
smooth and covered with a bloom. Flowers are bright yellow. The
leaves are edible when young.
Charlock (Brassica kaber)
(field mustard, kedluck, shellick, hevuck, field kale)
An annual weed, charlock grows to two feet high and is natu-
ralized in waste places. Leaves are yellow-green, rough, coarsely
toothed, and are very strong smelling. Bright yellow flowers are
followed by hairy pods. The leaves are edible and rich in vitamin C.
Greens: parboil greens, drain, and cook again. When you cook
mustard, the secret is to add some sugar to a big pot of greens to take
out the bitterness. Add chopped onion, salt and pepper, or bits of
fatback and grease. Another favorite recipe for mustard is to take
three large ham hocks; two chopped medium onions; one quart
water; three pounds greens; three tablespoons bacon fat; one teaspoon
salt; one-fourth teaspoon red pepper flakes; and freshly ground black
pepper. Boil the hocks and onions slowly for over an hour. Chop
greens in small pieces; add to ham hocks; add seasonings; cover and
simmer one hour until greens are tender. Then serve with cornbread.
Mustard buds: gather buds just before they open. Cook, drain,
serve with sauce made of prepared mustard and mayonnaise. (Tastes
like broccoli.)
Prepared mustard: grind mature mustard seeds; mix with flour,
water, and vinegar. Serve with meat or fish.
Flavoring: add tiny young mustard leaves to sandwiches, or put
in deviled eggs.
Mustard flowers: gather newly opened blooms. Cook in boiling
water. Remove from heat, add butter or bacon fat.
Mustard-ramp soup: clean and wash leaves. Heat one quart milk,
almost to boiling. Meanwhile melt bacon fat in skillet, add chopped
ramps, cook until brown. Add salt, pepper, flour, and mustard. Cook
five minutes. Add milk and simmer.
Watercress {Nasturtium officinale) (family Cruciferae)
Water cress is a perennial, introduced from Europe and naturalized
in cold, limestone-based streams. Stems grow to ten inches and recline
weakly. The dark green leaves are small and scalloped and very
pungent to taste or smell; they are often used raw in salads tp give a

spicy, tangy flavor. Small white flowers appear in April and May.
The whole plant is rich in iron and vitamins A, B, and C, and is
prized for salads, sandwiches, or soups. Raw cress, chopped fine,
mixed with mayonnaise and served on whole wheat bread, makes
delicious sandwiches.
Horseradish {Armoracia rusticana) (family Cruciferae)
Horseradish, native to Europe, is planted in gardens, but it also
persists around old house sites, or naturalizes in rich ground. It has
large, rather crinkled roots, somewhat like those of dock, but pungently
flavored and odorous. Flowers appear in midsummer on high branched
stalks. The deep, white, very pungent roots are edible, and supposed
to be an excellent spring tonic. They were once used for dyspepsia,
rheumatism, scurvy, and hoarseness, made into a tea of one teaspoon
ground roots to one cup of boiling water. Eating horseradish is a spur
to digestion. It is also supposed to expel kidney stones.
Some people say the young leaves are edible; others say that they
are not good to eat. They are extremely pungent and could probably
be used only when very young and tender.

be added for color. Dill seeds or honey may be added if desired.
Horseradish sauce: three tablespoons butter, one tablespoon flour,
one and one-half cups boiling beef stock and horseradish to taste are
mixed together until smooth. Serve over meat or fish.
Mix very young leaves with purslane or pigweed. The liquid makes
good pot liquor with corn pone.
Food preservation: "It looks quite a bit like mustard, but the roots
are as hot as any red pepper you ever saw. You know, we didn't have
a lot of refrigerators to keep things in back then. They'd get it and

This cress grows to two feet high in damp ground, along streams,
and in old fields. It is a common weed naturalized from Europe.
Dark green, divided, basal leaves appear in late fall, and can be
gathered all winter. In late spring the plant has a stalk of bright
yellow, four-petaled flowers. Seed pods are one inch long, slender
and slightly curved.
Winter cress (Barbarea vulgaris) is very similar in appearance, with
large, more deeply cut leaves.

This plant was named for St. Barbara's Day, December 4, for one
could gather the green leaves from December on. The leaves are
sharp-tasting, very like water cress, and can be cooked or used raw
in salads. The Barbareas are sometimes cultivated under the name
"upland cress."
Mrs. Norton told us, "They bloom yeller all over a cornfield, that's
creases. They have the same seed on them as mustard." The root
is a tiny bulb but Ethel Corn says, "That part ain't fit to eat."
Greens: pick, wash, and boil in water with piece of fat meat until
tender, cooking slowly. Or parboil them. Take out of water and put
in frying pan with grease. Fry five minutes with a little salt. Pick
more greens than you think you need, as they shrink. Serve with
vinegar or dill pickles, or cook and season as you would spinach.
When greens are older, cook in two waters, throwing cooking water
away. Aunt Arie Carpenter likes to put in a piece of middlin' meat
in the morning to boil. Boil that for at least two hours, or as long
as it takes to get it tender. Take the grease off the meat; add it to a
pot of water and bring to a boil. Add cleaned creases and boil for
thirty minutes. Mustard may be done the same way.
Cress salad: toss together lightly, two cups finely cut creases, one-
fourth teaspoon salt, one tablespoon salad oil, one tablespoon salad oil,
one tablespoon vinegar, one tablespoon French dressing. Or chop
young leaves, mix with sliced radishes, oil, and vinegar.
Sandwiches: add chopped cress leaves and peppergrass seeds to
sandwiches.
Fried creases: fry fatback meat in heavy pot, preferably old black
dinner pot. Have creases washed. Take meat out, leaving grease in
pot. Shake out creases and drop in hot grease, mixing thoroughly with
grease. Add just enough water to keep from sticking to pot. Add salt,
as desired, and cook about twenty minutes, or until tender. Stir often.
Cooked buds: gather buds of cress. Pour boiling water over buds.
Let stand half minute. Drain. Cover with fresh boiling water. Boil
three minutes. Drain. Season with salt, pepper, and butter. (Tastes
like broccoli.)
Spring cress (Cardamine hirsuta) (family Cruciferae)
Spring cress is found growing in all damp places, with a purplish
stem, and many basal, finely cut leaves. The stem is topped with a
cluster of very small, white, four-petaled flowers. Seed pods are very
slender.

Bitter cress (Cardamine pensylvanica) is very similar, and is found
in wet places, often growing in the water.
Bulbous cress {Cardamine bulbosa) also grows in wet places, with
long round leaves and white flowers. It grows from a bulb-like root.
The foliage of all the Cardamine cresses can be used in greens or
salads, and can be substituted in any recipe using creases. Leaves are
especially good raw in salads.
Toothwort (Dentaria diphylla) (family Cruciferae)
(turkey mustard, turkey salad, turkey cress, crinkleroot, pepper-
root)
A small plant with creeping stems, toothwort has three-parted leaves
veined with white. Stems and underside of leaves may be purple.
The white, four-petaled flowers grow in a cluster and are very
showy. Both the leaves and the bulbous roots are edible. Turkey mus-

Dentaria laciniata, crowfoot or turkeyfoot, has leaves divided into
narrow segments. This grows in colonies in rich woodlands.
Peeled roots or young leaves add flavoring to salads, but a very little
goes a long way. "You talk about something strong, it's strong. It
grows on branches and tastes like tame mustard. It can be used as a
tonic for old people in the spring," said Harley Carpenter.
"It's a right tasty little weed," said Delia Williams. "It will remind
you of mustard quite a bit."
Greens: pick leaves. Cut up in bite-size pieces and wash thoroughly.
Place in bowl, pour hot grease over them, salt and serve. A quart
basket of leaves will make two or three servings. If desired, pour a
little vinegar over them. Or cut up the leaves and put bacon gravy
over them and salt.

Brook lettuce is found in very wet seepage slopes, springheads,
on rocks in streams or on stream banks. It has four-to-six-inch dark
green, succulent leaves that are irregularly scalloped on the edges and
slightly fuzzy. Young leaves are used in salads.
Myrtle Lamb told us, "It is kind of a long-leaf thing, and grows
in the wettest damp places, where moss grows. As it gets older, it
gets a red cast to it."
Mrs. Norton said, "It's kind of sticky when its gets old, so you
have to get it when it's real young."
Salad: Myrtle Lamb likes to take brook lettuce and cut it like tame
lettuce, and put onions in it, and hot grease on it. Then sprinkle salt
and pepper over it. Or just pour hot grease over it so that it wilts.
It can be eaten like wild mustard or turkey mustard.
Blue violet (Viola papilionacea ]
(johnny-jump-up)
(family Violaceae)
The blue violet is common in meadows, lawns, and damp, open
woodlands. It grows to eight inches tall, with heart-shaped, deep green
leaves, and long-stemmed, deep blue flowers. There is a cream-colored
form, and the common form with blue and white flowers, called
"confederate violet" and naturalized around many home and farm
sites.
Violet leaves and flowers are both edible. The blue wood violet
(Viola cucullata) is very similar, with darker blue flowers, and found
in rich woodlands and wet places along streams. Leaves and flowers of

both species can be used in any recipes. Leaves are very rich in vitamins
A and C. Many people mentioned mixing them in with other greens
such as wild mustards, creases, or lamb"s quarters. Leaves and flowers
are also used in tea, and in a medicine supposed to induce sleep,
and to "comfort and strengthen the heart."
Violet flowers have long been used in fancy confections, candied or
sugared. In the last century, a gift of candied violets was a "message
of love."
Greens: wash and cut up leaves of blue violets. Cook with a little
water twelve minutes. Serve butter over them, or cook with bacon
or fatback. Or mix violet leaves with dandelion greens or milkweed
shoots and top with bacon and chopped-up hard-boiled eggs. Or mix
with lamb's quarters or pokeweed and cook as above.
Violet salad: add chopped violets to other spring greens for salad,
or use alone with vinegar and bacon.
Violet jelly: cook violet flowers with boiling water. Strain, add
sugar, pectin, and juice of half a lemon. Simmer until it jells.*
Sugared violets: cook two cups sugar, one-half cup water, a dash of
cream of tartar. Stir until sugar grains. Dip fresh violet blossoms (free
from stems) and place on platter to dry.
Violet syrup: cover violet blossoms with water. Let stand two days.
Strain. Cook with honey and juice of lemon. Stir well. Bring to boil.
Put in jars and seal. Good for colds or coughs.
Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) (family Asclepiadaceae)
(silkweed, cottonweed)
Milkweed is a stout perennial, growing in colonies, to five feet tall.
It has large, oval, opposite leaves, and stems and leaves exude a
milky juice. It is found in dry fields and on roadsides. Rough pods
contain silky-winged seeds. Young shoots are edible when very young,
before leaves unfold. Young pods can be used as a substitute for okra,
and flowers are cooked into sugar.

rich in calcium, and make excellent greens, especially when added to
mustard.
English plantain, or ribwort {Plantago lanceolata), is known in the
mountains as white plantain. Leaves can also be eaten, but leaves
of rabbit plantain are preferred.
Plantains are rich in vitamins A and C.
Greens: pick leaves. Pull off stems, parboil fifteen minutes. Drain and

FOXFIRE 2
Wild lettuce is a tall plant, found in open woods, and in damp
places. Leaves are dentate, usually a bright blue-green color, and
very smooth to the touch. Small, dandelion-like flowers open briefly
in bright weather. They may be blue or whitish or pale violet. Lactuca
hirsuta and Lactuca canadensis are very similar, differing slightly in
leaf shapes, or in flower color, for flowers may be violet, white, or
yellow. Tall lettuce {Lactuca floridana) grows to six feet tall, with a
hollow, leafy stem, and white or pale blue flowers. Leaves of all
species of wild lettuce are edible when young and tender. Every
species will emit a milky juice when leaves or stems are broken.
Wild lettuce must be gathered and eaten in the early spring when
the plants are young, as the older plants get tough and wormy. Ethel
Corn told us, "It grows mostly in poor ground where it ain't tender.
When you get it, it has a flavor like tame lettuce, only it don't look
much like it, and it's a whole lot better."
Mrs. Keener said, "It's slick when it first comes up, the leaves are.
And it don't resemble lettuce at all, but it tastes like it. It's a little
bit tougher. You find it all along fence rows, or anywhere. It comes
up in early spring, that's when you get it; when it grows up tall, it's
too tough."
Mrs. Norton said, "You break a leaf off and if it's kinda milky, that's
wild lettuce."
Salad: cut up greens and wash. Cut green onions in it and pour hot
grease over it. Also good with vinegar, oil, and salt. Mrs. Irene Gray
says, "It sure did taste good!" Try frying bacon until crisp and
crumbly. Add brown sugar and vinegar and pour over chopped
wild lettuce leaves. For extra flavor, add chickweed or mustard.
Greens: pick young leaves (before they are eight inches high).
Wash, and cook with very little water. Add butter, salt, pepper, and
bits of bacon and bacon grease.
Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) (family Compositae)
(blowball, peasant's clock, cankerroot, down-head, yellow gowan,
witches' gowan, milk-witch)
Dandelions are common on lawns and in fields and along roadsides.
Stems grow three to fourteen inches and are hollow. Dark green,
dentate basal leaves emit a milky juice as they get old. The golden
yellow flowers are one to two inches across. Dandelion is a native of
Europe, naturalized all over America.
Edible parts include the young leaves, the flower buds, and the

scraped roots. Dandelion greens are very rich in iron and vitamin C.
Frederic Klees says a Dutchman has to eat dandelion salad on Maundy
Thursday to stay healthy all the year. Some authorities say the roots
are inedible, and all traces of root must be cut away when preparing
greens for cooking. Gather much more than you think you need, for
they cook down. Some cooks add a pinch of soda when cooking
dandelions. Mrs. Norton says, "You can use dandelion in tossed
salads, the kind with feathery leaves; it makes what you call a wild
salad."
Greens: gather when young, wash, and boil about twenty minutes
in water with fatback added; or drain and fry in grease. Season with
salt and pepper. Or after cooking, drain off water, and heat with
small amount of vinegar. Add small chunks of fried salt pork, heat,
and eat. Or cook lightly in salted water. Drain. Mix milk, butter,
one egg, and vinegar together. Cook to just a boil and pour over
greens.

dandelion flowers. Let stand until blossoms rise (twenty-four to forty-
eight hours). Strain into stone jar. Add juices of four lemons and four
oranges, and four pounds of sugar, plus one yeast cake. Stir four or five
times a day until it stops fermenting. Keep well covered. In two weeks,

Tall coneflower (Rudbeckia laciniata) (family Compositae)
(cochan, coach-ann)
Tall coneflower grows in wet places, with finely dissected, smooth
green leaves, and later in the season, tall stems of yellow, daisy-like
flower heads with green, cone-shaped centers. This is a close relative
of the brown-eyed susan, and the wild ancestor of the garden golden
globe.
Leaves are edible when young and tender. Mrs. Ethel Corn told us,
"You find it along branch banks. It looks like golden globe flowers,
and it will run up when it goes to seed. You have to watch when
picking it, for the wild parsnip looks similar to it, only it's more
whitish-leaved than that."
Mrs. Hershel Keener said, "There's a plant that grows along this
branch called coachie-ann; now I don't know how you spell it, and
it's got such an odor when it's cooking. You can boil it just like you
do poke, and season it real good, but I don't like it."

greens, or buff sallet and mustard mixed, or with creases. Fix and
precook until tender. Put in jars, add water, seal, and cook thirty
minutes in pressure cooker.
Mixed green salad:
Take equal parts of dandelion, shepherd's purse, peppergrass,
curly dock, poke shoots, and sorrel. Chop fine. Add wild onion to
taste. (Poke shoots must be cooked first.) Make a dressing of oil and
vinegar, and flavor with garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper. Serve on a

Wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) (family Rosaceae)
Wild strawberries grow in colonies, or beds, in open, sunny places,
in old fields, along roadsides, or damp meadows. Stems are three to
eight inches high, with three divided fuzzy leaves. Small, white flowers

• PLATE 59 Wild strawberries
appear in early spring, followed by the delicately flavored, red straw-
berries.
Strawberries are rich in iron and in vitamin C. They have a
wonderfully tart goodness for "eating out of hand," or they can be
used in jams, jellies, pies, preserves, desserts, cakes, or ice cream.
Some people are allergic to strawberries and may get a rash from
eating them. The berries are small and it takes a lot of work to ac-
cumulate enough for a pie, or a batch of jam, but they are well worth
the effort, and taste better for it. Someone said, "If it is four o'clock
by the time you get your clothes on, it will be light enough to pick
strawberries."
Strawberry leaves are used to make a delicately flavored tea, said
to be good for bladder infections.
Jam: put a quart of berries in a pot, add a cup of sugar, and
bring to a boil, stirring gently. Boil three minutes, add another cup
of sugar and boil three more minutes; then add a final cup of sugar,
skim off foam and put in jars and seal. Or boil for five minutes
one cup strawberries and one teaspoon vinegar. Add one cup sugar
and boil fifteen minutes; skim while hot. Set aside to cool all day or
overnight before putting in jars. Or cook four pounds of berries in
porcelain kettle. Boil juice first. Add two pounds sugar, and boil
again. Skim and put in jars.
Wild strawberry preserves: To a quart of strawberries, add one cup
of sugar and three tablespoons water. Boil slowly fifteen minutes. Let
stand overnight. Next morning, bring to boiling point and pour in
jars while hot. Or dissolve nine cups sugar in one cup water, add

eight cups berries and boil fifteen minutes. Skim; seal in jars. Or
boil equal weight berries and water for ten minutes. Set overnight.
Pour in shallow pans, cover with glass. Set in sunlight until it thickens,
then pour in jars.
Canned strawberries: fill hot jars two-thirds full with berries. Make
a syrup of one quart of water, one cup sugar, and fill jars. Berries
are not cooked.
Strawberry leather: mash ripe berries to pulp, spread on platters.
When dry, dust with sugar and roll up like a jelly cake into pieces.
Pack into clean jars.
Strawberry gelatin: use one package red fruit gelatin, one cup
boiling water, one pint wild strawberries. Dissolve gelatin in boiling
water, add berries, chill. Serve with cream, and garnish with whole
berries.
Strawberry mallow: use two cups wild strawberries, one-half cup
sugar, few grains salt, half pound marshmallows cut up, one cup
cream. Mix together and chill. Top with whole berries.
Strawberry pie: use three cups flour, one cup lard, one teaspoon
salt, one egg, five tablespoons cold water, one tablespoon vinegar,
strawberry filling. Sift flour, mix with lard, salt, cold water, and
vinegar. Mix well and roll out dough; put in greased pie pan. Bake
fifteen minutes. Make filling of one cup crushed strawberries, one-
half cup sugar, two tablespoons cornstarch, and one cup water.
Cook into a syrup. Fill pie crust with fresh strawberries, pour syrup
over top and serve. Or use one quart berries, one and one-half cups
sugar, one tablespoon flour, one-fourth pound butter. Cook berries
a few minutes, put in deep pie pan or dish, cover with a short biscuit
crust, dot with butter, and bake until crust is brown. Or put a layer
of strawberries in a pan, sprinkle with sugar, then a layer of biscuit
dough; keep layering until almost to top of pan. Bake until top is
brown.
Strawberries and pieplant (rhubarb) : cook pieplant with sugar;
just before it is done, add a cup of strawberries, let cool and eat.
Strawberry leaf greens: the leaves of wild strawberries were some-
times eaten along with blackberry leaves, fried in grease, or boiled in
water with fatback added.

HAPPY DOWDLE
had Dowdle got his nick-
name because, "I was
always in a good humor,
I reckon . . . You just as well laugh as to cry 'cause nobody don't
care nohow. That cryin' don't do no good. Don't do no good."
Even at eighty-six years of age, "Happy" hasn't slowed down much.
Neither has his wife. And his memory is as vivid and as clear as that of
a young man.
The oldest of seven children, he went to school, but "They all got
a better education than I ever got, fer I was always havin' t'do
somethin' around home. I had no chance t'go t'school. I finished
th'fourth grade, but that was all." While he was a boy, he traded
horses and cattle to make a little money, but when he was eighteen
years old he went to the logging camps in Washington state, stayed
there four years, came home and married and went back, bought a
house and became a foreman at one of the logging camps near
Hamilton, Washington. "They built a cabin for us t'live in up there,
and we was gettin' along fine. I had about twenty of th'prettiest
white-legged chickens you ever saw nearly. And we lived just above
th'plant."
But just when things seemed to be going smoothly, trouble hit. A
friend tipped him off that another man was visiting his wife pretty
regularly. That was the only way he would have ever found out, for
he could only get home on Saturday nights. The rest of the week he
was tied up at the camps.

============================================================

On his next trip home, he told his wife that he would not be
coming home the following Saturday night as they had to work over-
time at the camp. The following Saturday, he eased up to the house.
"About ten or eleven o'clock in th'night, I come in and th'doors is
all locked. So I commenced a'callin' her and I couldn't get no answer.
I had a dinin' room and a kitchen off from th'main part of th'buildin',
and I heard a racket start through there. I got t'th'kitchen door, but I
didn't get there quite till there was a man run out. And I shot at him
three times and he jumped th'fence. I didn't hit him, I guess.
"So I wadn't goin' t'live with a person like that. Me a'workin' like a
dog and a'bringin' in th'livin' there and tryin' t'give her th'best of
things she wanted. And I said, 'Well, now. What'a you think I am
anyhow?'
"She says, 'Well, that there boy just come t'see me.'
"I says, 'Well, he's been a'comin' pretty regular. I've been hearin'
of it.' And I says, 'If you think more of him than you do of me, I'll
take th'baby and I'll go back to North Carolina.'
"She says, 'Well, you can't do that.'
"I says, 'Well, we'll see whether I can't or not.' I said, 'Now you
picked you another home. Now hunt it out and see which end is
better.' I says, 'Me and you is done, woman—right now!'':
He sold the house. When she balked at letting him take their three-
year-old daughter, he said, "I've laid off and bit my tongue and
ever'thing else t'keep from shootin' you, but I will if you just fool
with me this mornin'." She packed the child's clothes, he gave her
two hundred dollars, and he and his daughter returned to North
Carolina where he began trading out of his own barn in Franklin.
We talked to Happy and Sarah—his second wife—literally for
hours, on three separate interviews. Here is some of what they told us,
excerpted from ninety-two pages of transcript. The story begins with
his return to these mountains after years of travel.
GREG STRICKLAND
Happy: They's a lots a'things about th'city I don't like. You're
hemmed up in little bitty huts, and it takes a pretty good moneyed
man t'buy a nice home in th'city. Out here, you can turn your
kids loose, and they can play around here with nothin' t'bother'em,
but if they'uz in th'city, they couldn't.
Sarah: They ain't much place they can play in th'city, except in

their back yard, and they have t'fence'em in then t'keep'em corralled.
I wouldn't know anything about th'city, and I'm proud I don't.
Happy: Yeah. I've always liked th'country life. You've got a little
ol'place special of your own. You can do whatever y'want'a do there.
You ain't got t'run t'nobody and ask'em what t'do and all this stuff.
Sarah: I think you got more freedom in th'country than you would
have in th'city. And then when y'went out on your porch, y'ain't
a'thinkin' they's somebody watchin'y' all th'time. I wouldn't like that.
And they're just simply friendlier in th'country. Them city people
don't even ask you to come in. They don't have time t'fool with y'. If
you want anything, you have t'teU'em what y'want right at their door;
and if they don't have time, they'll say, "Well, come back some other
time," or so on.
Happy: Yeah. People are friendly and nice—that is, people who
have got and stayed up here. And it's a better place t'grow up in.
Now you take when I was boy, somebody'd make us a little home-
made wagon t'pull around. Maybe have y'a goat and put to it. We'd
have th'best time around here with that goat and wagon, and
th'neighborhood boys'd come, and they'd have th'best time. And we'd
make pop guns out'a elders and play with them. We'd make sling-
shots—take and cut out a piece a'leather, y'know, and cut holes in it
and put rubber to it. Shoot with it around th'barn or at home.
And there was money enough t'get along. I had a uncle over here
in th'Patton Settlement. If y'had a few dollars, you could raise you
some yearlings and stuff. I'd gather up a bunch like that—go t'a
neighbor's house and if he had one t'sell, I'd buy it if I could, y'know.
And I'd bring it in and put'em together, and my uncle would come
over there and buy th'whole bunch, and I'd make a little on it.
And I'd help him drive'em over across th'gap yonder inta his
settlement. Yeah, I done that when I was just a boy. When I had'em
together, I'd send word to'im. There wadn't no telephones then,
y'know.
And my father trained me up t'handle all kind of stock. When I
was seven'r'eight year old, I'd take care of'em. He trained me that.
And if I didn't do what I was told when I was just a chunk of a boy,
he'd cut th'limb off. That's what they called it. Th'apple trees up
there had lots'a limbs. He'd jerk off one of'em and take it to me.
He trained me t'be honest. Their word was their bond at that time,
and y'didn't have t'put up no bond when y'went t'borry money. It
was your name. Your neighbor would loan y'money and just take
your word. But y'can't do that now. He said, "Thad, if you die in

th'poor house, try t'be honest. Do what you promise anybody, and
don't try t'defraud nobody." I had a good ol'daddy. And mother too.
Shore did.
He taught me how t'plow, how t'take care of horses, how t'har-
ness'em and how t'work'em. And we kept cows and things there. We'd
go and help mother milk, y'know, and stuff like that. He learned us
all that stuff.
He had a country store there, m'father did. Good long while. And
after I got big enough, we had a covered wagon, and we'd go around
th'country here and go t'people's houses and buy their chickens,
put'em in this wagon, and th'next mornin' go out t'Tallulah Falls
t'seU'em. Then we'd bring back a load a'goods for our store, y'see,
when we left. We made lots'a trips like that.
We bought a hunderd and some turkeys once. A man down in
Georgia come up and wanted'em. Wanted these turkeys. We drove
them turkeys in th'road from here t'Tallulah Falls. They'd go
t'jumpin' up on th'fences and be goin' t'roost, and we had t'stop
there. Yeah—that's true. Took two days, y'know, with th'turkeys.
They'd get tired, y'know, and we'd go slow. But they'd all stay
t'gether nearly. We never lost a turkey. We started down th'road, and
a turkey'd run t'th'side, y'know, and he'd run back. We had a covered
wagon. It kept them kind'a t'gether, y'know. Drove along behind'em
all th'time.
After I got big enough t'drive a team—oh, Fuz fourteen'r'fifteen
years old—he'd let me drive. After I got onta th'roads'n'ever'thing,
and Daddy got kind'a down with th'rheumatism, he said t'me one
mornin', he says, "Thad? You reckon you can make it t'th'Falls'n'-
back?"
I said, "Yeah, I can make it."
Said, "You afraid t'camp out?" (We had t'camp out one night
on th'road, y'know.)
I said, "No, I'm not afraid t'camp out." I had a big bulldog there
at home. I said, "I'll take him with me, and th'first person that'll tackle
me, he'll eat him up." And he would too.
So I made a trip one day, and got over there to th'Falls, and they'uz
some men all around there—had a big dog with'em—and they kept
their eye on me. I happened t'notice'em, y'know. I was waitin' there
t'check up th'stuff I'd took there t'sell this man, y'know.
And they'uz a'watchin' me close.
Along in th'evenin' I figured on comin' back up th'road about
seven'r'eight miles that night. They was lots'a pretty campin' places

all up th'creek there, y'know. So I come on after I'd went t'th'depot
and got what I had t'get.
I come on, and they was a road come this'away, and they'uz a little
branch come down here, and on th'other side a'this branch there was a
pretty campin' place. We'd generally camp there if we'uz t'happen
t'be there at th'right time. So I drove out.
I watered m'mules and fed'em and built me up a little fire and
fried me some eggs and sausage and stuff fer supper, and made me
some coffee. And I'uz sittin' there eatin'—had m'stuff sittin' on
m'lunch box. And here come that big dog out in th'road that I saw at
th'Falls. And I thinks t'm'self, that's th'dog I saw down there with
them men. Might'a been a man'r'two held up along through there,
but I didn't know.
But anyhow, they wadn't but a few minutes an'at dog come back
trottin' along 'at road, and directly I heard th'brush a'kinda cracklin'
in there. They was a lot a'dead ivy bushes in there that had fell, and
you'd step on one of'em and they'd crack like a whip, y'know. And I
heard one of'em fall.
I had a good pistol. I said, "Who are y'there. What'r y'doin'
around here anyhow?"
And nobody said a word, and nobody moved. And I think if 'at
dog comes back by here again, I'll shoot th'son-of-a-gun. And I
hadn't no more got it out'a m'holster and here he come. I shot at'im,
and when I shot at'im, they went t'tearing that ivy down a'gettin'
out'a there. And I held th'dern pistol runnin' in th'ivy right atter'em.
Well, they was a big oak tree 'bout like that'un right down there. I
stood behind that oak, an' m'pistol, till daylight. I never went back
t'no wagon t'go t'sleep, ner nothin' else. I just stood there behind that,
an' I knowed if they come t'm'camp, I'd kill one of'em'r'all of'em.
But they never come back.
Next mornin' pretty early I fed m'mules and hooked'em up and
got m'breakfast and give them their breakfast and got out. I got home
a little bit early, but I made it back home. So I told Daddy what'd
happened, and he said, "It's a wonder they didn't kill you." He says,
"I ain't gonna let you go n'more."
I said, "Yeah you are too. I'm just as able t'take it as you are. I'm
satisfied I am." I said, "I made it this time. I'll make it again."
"Well," he said, "if that's th'way you feel about it, all right."
So I took th'wagon there all th'time after that.
It was a hard livin', but it was good.
Sarah: They had corn shuckin's a lot. That was one thing was

good. They'd gather their corn in and pile it up in a big pile—a
hundred'r'two hundred bushels. And they'd gather ever'thing that
could be thought of teat, and you went and ate all you wanted.
Th'wealthiest family in this community, they had a big water bucket
full'a grape wine made out of white grapes, and a dipper in it. And
my brother—he took a couple a'dipper fulls and fell down and skint
both of his knees. He got high. And they walked two'r'three miles
t'these corn shuckin's, and when this'un'd get through with his corn,
he'd go on to somewhere else for th'next night.
Happy: They'd help one another, y'see.
Sarah: And they'd split rails—they'd help split rails t'build fences.
And all th'women'ud be in th'house a'cookin' dinner and quiltin'.
We'd have th'best times!
They'd visit each other and take their knittin', y'know. They'd have
t'knit their stockings and socks. Lord, I learned t'knit and I wish I
never had! My mother'd make me sit down ever' night. I knit till I
couldn't hardly get my breath.
Happy: They used t'love one another. It ain't like it used t'be at all.
Sarah: They'd be eight in th'field a'hoein' at one time.
Happy: Now it's just so many different things that's come ahead
of'em. People are enjoyin' themselves a'ridin' in th'old car'r'airplane'r
somethin' like that, y'see. They'd rather be in that as t'be associated
with you'r'him'r'me.
Sarah: Now they don't have time t'have a conversation even on
th'streets of Franklin. And that's where I see most of my friends and
schoolmates. They never come t'see'y'r'nothin', y'know. But they used
to. They did. But anymore, they've given it up. Not unless you fix up a
big dinner and invite'em t'come.
Happy: They loved one another better, yeah.
Sarah: You could turn your old cows out in th'woods. You had
t'go two'r'three miles t'get'em of a evenin' t'bring'em in t'milk'em.
Happy: We used t'get out at Christmas time and get a bunch a'bells
and ten'r'fifteen crowds, y'know, and go from house t'house sere-
nadin'. Oh, we'd shoot guns and holler and ring these bells an' ever'-
thing else. We had a better time then they do now. Th'young folks
don't have t'fun and places t'go that we used t'have. Un-uh. Wonder
why it does thataway?
Sarah: Probably 'cause there's lots more that's got more money than
say, we young'uns, and it's went t'their heads where they won't
hardly speak t'y' no more. I'll tell 'y, honey; they didn't have no car
t'run out and get away from home.

Happy: I had a aunt that lived right across th'river from us—from
where I'uz raised up there—and she'd come maybe once a week—
ever' two weeks anyhow—and stay all day with Mother, y'know; and
they'd talk and crochet and sit around and crochet and talk. Talk
about this'n'that'n'th'other.
Sarah: Yeah. They'd knit and embroider.
Happy: Yeah. And they'd have a good time. But people don't do
that no more.
Sarah: And they used t'get out and 'sang [ginseng] hunt. They'd
get lots'a 'sang. Big crops. Forty dollars a hunderd. And, honey, in
th'fall of th'year we used t'go out and pick chestnuts up to buy our
winter shoes with. And they'uz about a dollar and a half, a dollar
and seventy-five cent a bushel.
Happy: Sometimes y'got a dollar. I've bought'em fer a dollar a
hunderd.
Sarah: And then y'could buy you a pair of shoes fer a dollar, and
you could buy you enough cloth t'make you a dress fer a quarter. All
that stuff now is three'n'four dollars.
Happy: People didn't have ever'thing in th'world. They wasn't
a'cravin', y'know. But now, you take folks now; you take a family
maybe down here that's got plenty a'money, and they can stare back
and kinda side-swarp'y'. Well, such folks as that I don't pay no 'tention
to. I just go ahead. I've always been a poor boy, and I don't owe no-
body nothin', and I get along pretty good anyhow. So if they want'a
'sociate, they know it; and if they don't, why just forget 'em. That's
th'only way t'do it.
Sarah: We had a neighbor over last week t'help us plant our 'taters.
Happy: Oh, yeah. Now that's th'kind'a neighbors y'used t'have. But
they're old-timers kinda like us, y'know. Oh you got neighbors here
that'll come and see us, and if we needed'em fer anything, they're
right here; but they ain't like they used t'be so much. They don't come
t'see whether you do need'em or not. That makes a big difference.
Sarah: I remember when my daddy had steers, and he'd hitch'em
t'th'wagon and go off on Sunday and stay all day t'see somebody—
have dinner with'em. And I remember very well havin' t'cross a great
big creek, and them old steers'ud just a'howl over there. My daddy
plowed th'steers, and when th'ground got too wet t'plow, used t'go
fishin'.
Happy: Yeah. If it rained and y'couldn't work on th'crops, why
they'd go fishin', or t'see their neighbors.
Sarah: Seem like they had more time then we do now.

Happy: Maybe they didn't value their time so much.
[After Happy returned from the West, he bought his own piece of
land, remarried, and raised a son himself much in the same way his
father had raised him.] Way it happened, they'uz an old gentleman
come and bought this lot here, and he started t'put up a little house.
Well, he put up a little shack. Just this room was just about what he
had up. An he'uz an ol'bach, y'know—never had been married, and
his folks all lived over yonder on th'other branch. He got homesick
and wanted t'sell it t'me.
So he come in one night when I come in. I talked with'im awhile.
Said, "I'll tell y'what I come out here for, Mr. Dowdle."
I said, "What's that?"
Said, "I want t'sell you my little place out there."
Well, I'uz hardly able t'buy that and run m'business too. But we
talked on a little bit, and I asked him then what he wanted for it.
Said he wanted eight hunderd dollars. "Well," I said, "I wouldn't be
interested."
So he went on back t'his cabin, and he stayed gone a couple
a'nights. When I come in again, he was at th'house again. We talked
there t'gether, and he said, "Uh—have y'thought any more about
buyin' m'place?"
I said, "No, I never give it a thought."
He said, "I want eight hunderd dollars fer it."
I said, "I wouldn't be interested at all."
And he went off that time. And th'next night, here he was out
there again. He said, "Uh, you never did make me no offer."
I said, "Well, I always make a man an offer, and if he can't take it,
it don't make me mad."
"Well," he said, "what would y'do?"
I said, "I'll give you six hunderd dollars fer yer place."
He says, "That's awful little."
"Well," I says, "it ain't much. No, but six hunderd dollars—you
don't just roll it up ever'where."
"Well," he said, "I'm gonna go back over yonder t'm'folks. When
could we make th'deed?"
I said, "Make th'deed? Right in th'mornin' if y'want to. I've got
yer money. When you make th'deed, yer money's ready."
"Well," he said, "we'll just go t'town in th'mornin' then and get it
all done."

I said, "Suits me fine." So I moved out here; sold off part of it, and
that fer way more money than I give fer th'whole thing. So I've still
got this, and I'm gonna keep it long as I'm here.
I used t'get pretty high with whiskey. That was th'worst habit I
had. Well, I got t'goin' with m'wife here, and she hates that worse
than anything in th'world. So she said, "I don't ever aim t'go with
you again if you don't quit that drinkin'."
I'd get about half high and go down in m'old Model T and ask her
t'go fer a ride, and she'd say, "No, sir."
So I'd just go on, and ever' time I'd see her, I'd wave and go on
like that. Well, after we'uz married, she said, "What made you do
thataway?"
"Well, I'uz just a'tryin' you out t'see what you thought of me."
Then I had a son. M'boy said, "Dad, I smell liquor on you!" I had
'bout a pint and had just took a drink'r'two. I got it up and shook it
good. I said, "If I'm gonna raise that boy, that'll be a poor way
t'bring him up. I'm done!" So I took that bottle and poured it out
right then. I've never touched it since, and that's been thirty years.
I've heard folks say that they couldn't quit this and they couldn't
quit that. They can quit anything they've got a ambition t'do. And
when m'boy was goin' t'growin' up, I decided that wadn't a good
thing t'bring out in front a'him. And fer th'respect a'him.
It was hard t'do. Whenever you'd walk around two'r'three and
smell that liquor on'em, y'know, it'd kind a'run up in yer blood.
There was a barn down yonder, and sometimes they'd come in there
with their bottles t'drink, y'know; and they'd ever'one offer me. And
I said, "Boys, I've done drunk my part a'that!"
And it wadn't long till they quit comin' down there a'drinkin'
s'much. I wanted my boy raised right. An' we had good times. Did
things in th'country we couldn't do in th'city. Here at one time I had
five'r'six horses. My brother-in-law had a wagon up at th'old farm,
and he said I could use it if I wanted to. I didn't have a wagon, and
I went up there and got it and brought it down here; and didn't we
put a bow-frame on it, mother? I split out somethin' and made
some bows and put a sheet over it; and I had a good saddle and
bridles and halters and stuff fer m'horses, and me and m'boy took off
stoppin' and a'tradin' along.
We didn't get fer th'first day—oh, fifteen'r'twenty mile—and we
camped out ever'night we was gone. And th'first night we'uz camped
out, I got tickled—he'uz just a chunk of a boy.

Sarah: He come back and he was dirt and hog hairs and ever'thing
else! He hadn't had a bath in a week!
Happy: Only place was th'river, and it'uz too cold there.
Sarah: When they come back I got th'washpot down yonder, and
I had a big pot of hot water and he went and took a good bath and
cleaned his clothes. He never turned over all night. He was wore out!
Happy: Anyway, we slept on th'road ever' night; and th'first night
we was gone, why her and her nephew come down there t'see how fer
we got.
Sarah: When we'd go, we'd take milk and different things t'eat,
y'know; and I enjoyed it, and my boy did too.
Happy: We made pretty good th'next day, and got gone a pretty
good little piece. Well, I got t'stoppin' at each house along seein' if
they wanted t'swap horses'r'buy one, y'know. And that kills time.
So we went along—got along pretty good. And we come one night
t'where this guy had a little store. Had a pretty good barn. I decided
t'shove m'horses in his barn, and we stayed around there about nearly
two days. Spread out our bed in that barn loft in that hay.
And I traded a little there—traded two'r'three times—and we
went on from there t'Murphy. They had a sale barn at Murphy,
y'know. Ever'body kinda gathered in there a certain day, and I
swapped fer a pair a'young mules. And they never had been worked
too much, so I took one of'em; led'im with a brake horse. And I
said, "Thad, we'll break these mules goin' home—one at a time."
So, yep, he agreed t'that, and we got along all right. We come
out over t'th'top of th'mountain 'tween here and Clayton—and he'd
been a'ridin' and a'leadin' up to here. An' he said, "Daddy, let me
drive th'wagon awhile. I'm gettin' tired a'ridin' this horse."
I said, "All right, son." I had one a'them young mules in with a
gentle horse, y'know, t'th'wagon. I said, "Son, don't turn them lines
loose. You hold them lines. And watch th'brake on yer wagon."
All right. We got on down there, and sure enough, when we went
t'pass the little bridge, th'mule run away with it! Yee-day! He'uz
goin' s'hard I couldn't catch up with'im. So finally he got'em
steered into th'bank down there and stopped'em.
I said, "Son, are y'a'hurtin'?"
He said, "No, but I'm scared t'death!" He said, "You'll drive'em
from here on home!"
I said, "All right, son. That'll be all right."
So I brought'em on down here and turned'em in my pasture here,

and a fella saw these young mules. And he had a pretty good pair
a'horses. He come up here and looked at th'mules and made me an
offer. I went and looked at his horses and we traded.
We took'em down there, and I told'im they wadn't well broke. He
ought t've had sense enough t'see that 'cause they was skittish, y'know.
But he took'em down there and hooked'em up first thing t'his wagon,
and they run away and tore his wagon all t'pieces.
Th'next time I saw him in town he was so mad at me he didn't
know what t'say. I said, "Well, you ain't got no right t'be mad at
me. I told you these mules wadn't thoroughly broke."
"Oh yeah! But you said you'd worked'em."
"I said I worked'em both, but one of'em run away with my boy.
You got t'break them mules."
And he was mad at me fer a long bit, but he got over it.
But I quit that drinkin' business on account of my son. It was just
trouble anyway.
I'uz just thinkin' this mornin' about a man that just died. All
right. This man had put that scar on my head there. That was a
bad'un. Sure was a pretty'un!
We'd all went off t'th'Georgia line and got us some liquor, and
we'uz comin' back and somethin' happened t'th'old car. We'uz afraid
th'law'd overtake us, y'see, and we got out and hid th'whiskey up
there so we could go back maybe th'next day and get it.
So this feller come on down there with his car, and he tried t'crank
it and he couldn't crank it. It was just a old crank-starter car. And
after we hid th'stuff and come on back down there, I said, "What in
th'world's th'matter?"
He said, "What do you care!" And he jerked out that there
cranker and he lamed me right in th'head. Boy, th'blood flew. That
knocked me out, and that's exactly what left that scar there. That's
exactly what done it. Bein' out with drunks and that's where it
winds up.
And I hadn't bothered that feller, and since that he's begged'n'ever'-
thing else. And ever' time we'd go t'church, he'd foller. Made a
church member. Finally, ever' time he'd meet me, he'd shake hands
and pat me on th'shoulder. And of course you've got t'forgive a man
when he does that, y'know. And I did. We got along pretty good from
then on. Never had n'more trouble.
But if I'd had my pistol that night, I guess I'd a'shot him. I had a

good'un at home, but I just happened not t'have it on me or I
would'a been in trouble.
But I hope that th'old feller's gone t'heaven. It's been many years
now that he's been livin' like a man ought to. I think he had anyway.
Don't hear no different.
[At this point, we turned the discussion toward a "good" life and
what that consists of.] Well, I ought'n t'bother you, nor do no harm
again' you. I ought'a be a'tryin' t'lift you up instead a'tryin' t'down
you worse'n'worse. That ain't right. That ain't right, no sir. And you're
not supposed t'get out and get pretty well fixed, y'know, and get
t'feelin' that you're better'n anybody else. That ain't so. They's poor
people that ain't got a dime'll maybe get further t'heaven than we
will—if they live right.
If people'ud get more normal and not get high up on one another
and treat one another right and love one another and pray for each
other, that'd be th'best thing could happen. But it'll never be, I'm
afraid. I'm afraid that'll never be. I don't think it could happen.
See, th'Lord made this world, and he put ever'thin' in it. And
he'uz a'lookin' fer us all t'go to Him when we leave here and our
spirit goes back and our body goes t'th'dust. And at Judgment Day,
why we'll be there with him.
Sarah: That's what I'm tickled of and pleased of. Salvation's free.
You don't have t'pay your way in.
Happy: Th'trouble t'day is churches ain't like they used t'be. I've
heard preachers get up in th'pulpit and preach, and I didn't believe
a word they'uz a'tellin'. Yeah. And I had some t'get up and preach,
and they preached th'Bible.
If a man's a'goin' t'go out and preach, he'd better preach that
Bible. If he don't, th'Lord won't carry him through.
Now that's a good point of people havin' a good education now. If
you read that Bible pretty regular, and you know th'Bible pretty
good, when th'pastor gets up there on Sunday mornin' and goes
t'preachin' some stuff that ain't in th'Bible, you know it don't you?
Yeah, you know it right there. Then y'lose confidence in that man.
I know that. I've set with'em.
Y'see, that Bible was wrote on th'wall. That was wrote fer t'stand
forever. Y'can't take nothin' from it ner add nothin' to it. It just
means what it says in there, and that's all. Yeah. No, sir. That's it.
Sarah: They's a lot a'difference in church than what it used t'be.

They used t'have th'spirit of th'Lord t'make us shout. Y'hardly ever
see anybody shout anymore.
Happy: Yeah. They lived closer t'th'Lord than people's a'doin'
today. Th'Devil's a'gettin' ahead of th'Master. Th'Devil's a'gettin'
along fast, y'know; and th'Master ain't a'gettin' all these folks t'do
like they used t'do. That's my way a'lookin' at it. I think th'biggest
thing in th'world a'sellin' more people t'th'Devil, mebbe, is this pride.
Thinkin', "Well, I'm better'n you are. I don't want nothin' t'do with
you." All such stuff as that. Now that's th'foolishest thing 'at anybody
can have in their mind.
They ain't nobody up and down this country here that will tell you
that they ever met me but what I'd speak to'em and treat'em nice.
And if they wadn't so good, well, that'uz all right. Go right ahead
anyway; speak to'em. Treat'em nice and go on. I ain't a'gonna brag
about it, but I've got friends all over this country. Good friends too.
I've got friends that if I had t'send to'em tonight, they'd be here.
That's th'only way t'live, see? Only way. Yes, sir.
Sarah: Folks should treat each other th'way we like t'be treated.
Happy: That's th'way we ought'a do.
Sarah: Some people'r'ashamed they're Christians, and some aren't.
Happy: You can go t'people's houses now and visit'em on Sunday
night'r'somethin', and they'll never say nothin' 'bout havin' prayer
before y'leave.
Sarah: And go t'th'table and never thank th'Lord fer what He
gives us.
Happy: I've had folks t'come in here and visit me—we try t'read a
little Bible every night and have a little prayer and thank th'Lord fer
takin' care of us through th'day—and they's many people that's left
that all off. And some of'em laugh at us fer that. That's ignorance.
That's ignorance right up here [tapping his head].
Sarah: We used t'have prayer meetin's in th'home, y'know, and
have th'best time singin' old-timey songs!
Happy: We used t'have family prayers. Daddy'd read a little
scripture and Mother'd pray. I was real young then. Dad was a
pretty good reader. He went through high school/ He was more edu-
cated.
Sarah: My mother taught me about th'Bible, and that they was
a hell and a heaven. Lots a'people argue with y'that they ain't no

people like that? Boys, it won't do! Accordin' t'my way a'lookin' at

People believed on th'Bible more then. They appreciated th"Bible
more'n they do now. Yes, sir. They's lots a'folks come in here and
I'd ask'em t'have prayer'r'somethin'. Or t'read some Bible t'me.
They'd glance up, and mebbe they didn't want t'do it. See, now
that's th'way it is.
We had some neighbors—they're not Christian—and I asked'em
if either one of'em prayed. They said, "No."
I said, "Well, we have prayer. If you want t'stay fer prayer, it's
about bed time. I'm gonna pray. I'm gonna read some scriptures
here and we're gonna have a prayer." And they didn't come back
fer th'longest time. They never come back now. Well, that's all right.
If that's all they know now and all they can learn, why, I ain't
responsible. I tried t'show'em what'uz right there, and I tried t'teU'em.
Never go t'disputin' that Bible, folks. You're doing th'wrong thing.
That'uz made fer us t'go by.
Sarah: It's like plantin' by th'signs.
Happy: Well, shore!
Sarah: If you plant corn on th'new of th'moon, it grows straight
up—way high up—and th'ear grows straight up too. Plant on th'full
of th'moon and it won't get very high.
Happy: That's real good.
Sarah: Plant your Irish potatoes on th'new of th'moon and they
lay right on top of th'ground. When they make themselves they'll be
sun dry. Now on th'full of th'moon, they go down deeper.
And th'good Lord said in th'Bible that that moon and stars was
set up there for th'signs of th'seasons.
Happy: That's what it's fer.
Sarah: And y'know, that man's face in th'moon is th'man who
burnt th'brush pile on Sunday, and they had that face cut in th'moon.
I've heard that since I was a little girl. That's old-timey stuff, now.
[What do you think about the men going to the moon? Did you
ever think you would see that in your lifetime?] Happy: Well, no I
didn't. And I don't know yet that they went. There's a lot a'red tape
t'that, son.
Sarah: Well, we did see them up there pickin' up rocks anyway.

pick up rocks anywhere, but I'll never believe they went t'th'moon.

but is it true? That's it. I don't believe. No. I don't believe it. That's
a money scheme, don't y'see?
Sarah: Well, there y'are. They spent millions a'dollars t'go t'th'moon
where they's little children starvin' t'death fer something t'eat. They
must not a'realized that. 'Course now, naturally, we don't know what
it is t'be hungry. All my life we've had plenty t'eat. But not much
t'spare.
Happy: Yep. We didn't need anything.
Sarah: My mother worked in th'fields same as th'house. Our old
cook maid too. And they worked in th'fields and set me down in
th'shade on this old quilt! If you're poor, y'have t'make somethin'
t'eat. And she made her own soap t'do th'washin' with.
Happy: Yeah. We've worked hard and tried t'be good, and we've
made it all right. I got this little house here. I don't owe nobody a
nickel. And I've got a little bank account and she has too. So what
d'we worry fer? We're too old now t'prosper much anyhow. And
we've educated that boy. Put him where he's at. 'Course he worked
his way—a lot of it—too. But I didn't mind it—to roll up them
sleeves and work. And pulled in a little social security and we draw
that. I ain't done all I ought'a done, mebbe, but they ain't nobody
thataway, I don't believe.
You know, they's lots a'folks in th'world that wonders how poor
folks like us live.
Sarah: It's funny how th'rich people don't appreciate what
th'Lord's given them.
Happy: They don't. They don't! And they're goin' t'have to repent
fer that before they leave this old world—or do somethin' about it.
You know, I ain't as heavy up there [tapping head] as I used t'be.
I can't remember like I used to. And I'm afraid if you folks live to be
as old as I am you'll be th'same way. Eighty-six years old. I'm not
a'braggin' now, mind y', and I hope I don't, but they ain't many a
man eighty-six years old that can get around and keep what little
mind he has got.
I'll tell y', they ain't many thataway.

MAKING AN OX YOKE
ecently, we began to try to
find someone who could
.make an ox yoke for us. A
yoke, as you probably know, rests on the shoulders of a pair of oxen, and
attached to it are the lines or chains from a wagon, sled, plow, or
whatever else is being pulled. Rarely is one seen in use any longer, but
occasionally you can find one lying around an old barn, or hanging in
someone's living room, or set up in an antique shop with a giant price
tag attached. And it is even harder to find someone who still knows
how to make one. After talking to several people about making a yoke
for us, we were beginning to get discouraged. Then we were told about
Tommy Barnes.
Mr. Barnes is a small, friendly man who is usually quiet. He
doesn't speak much unless asked specifically about something. He
lives with his wife in a small frame house in the Buck Creek Com-
munity in North Carolina. When we found him, we were warmly
welcomed and immediately felt at home. He agreed to make the
yoke for us and told us that if we came back in a few days, he'd
have time to begin working on it. Waiting around, we were really
excited about our first interview and could hardly wait to get started.
When we went back, we gathered around his workshop—a cleared-
out space around the base of a large, aging apple tree in his front
yard. In and around the apple tree were different parts of yokes in
various stages of completion. Leaning up against the tree was an
old handmade ladder, and old pieces of wood and wood chips cov-
ered the ground. Not far away lay an anvil, and in the yard were

============================================================
PAGE 109
============================================================

MAKING AN OX YOKE
tubs of apples that had been gathered from the old tree. Sitting in the
shade was a handmade bench worn from excessive use over years.
Standing there answering our questions as he worked, we felt the
uniqueness of Tommy Barnes and his way of life: "The first'un I
made, I had a brother. And me and him had three yoke a'cattle
apiece—six yoke. And we logged all over this mountain here, and he
knows how to make a yoke. But th'first man that made a yoke like
this one was Beals, and he showed me how t'do it. I've made a
hundred yoke at this place."
The most popular woods for yokes are ash, black gum, pine,
sassafras, and yellow poplar. Tommy's favorite, however is pine:
"Well, I'd rather have pine as yeller poplar. Yeller poplar sometimes
season cracks, and that won't do it!" So saying, he began to hew.
STAN ECHOLS
PLATE 64

============================================================
PAGE 110
============================================================

PLATE 65 Roughing out the yoke is a
fairly simple process. After the size of the
yoke to be made is determined (see dia-
grams), the sides of a piece of round stock
of appropriate size are hewn off leaving a
rough-hewn, rectangular block of wood.
The outline of the yoke is drawn on the
sides using a pattern—if one is available—
or measurements. Then, with an auger, the
four holes for the bows are drilled from the
top surface in the proper places.
PLATE 66 
Next, with an axe or hatchet, and turning the yoke from side to
side as necessary, the yoke is hewn out in rough form. A drawing knife is used
for the final smoothing and shaping.

============================================================
PAGE 111
============================================================

PLATES 67-69 With the yoke hewn out, the next step is to make the bows.
Hickory is usually used for this because of its ability to bend easily without
breaking, and because of its toughness. Often a. four-inch in diameter green
hickory pole of appropriate length is quartered, and the sharp, angled edges of
the quarters shaved off to make pieces that are roughly round.
Now the bow is slowly and gradually bent as shown in Plate 67 (the attaching
of two stout poles to the ends of the hickory stock), 68 (the beginning of the
actual bending), and 69.
PLATE 70 Stan helps tie the bow ends together to keep it curved.
115

============================================================
PAGE 112
============================================================

PLATE 71 
The bow could be left tied
if desired, and set up in the barn loft to
season and "set." For our purposes, how-
ever, that wasn't necessary. Mr. Barnes
simply went ahead and trimmed off any
splinters . . .
PLATE 72 
. . . untied the bows
and slid them into place . . .
PLATE 73 
. . . and then got out the
steeple and nailed it into place in the
bottom center of the yoke. Chains used
to pull wagons and sleds are hooked to
the steeple's ring. The weight of the
load behind pulling on the ring holds
the yoke firmly in place on the oxen's
shoulders.

============================================================
PAGE 113
============================================================

PLATES 74-77 
With Mrs. Barnes's and Stan's help, Mr. Barnes selects a
small drill and drills two holes—one on the inside end of each bow (Plate 75).
He then saws off the ends of the bows and, using the scrap, whittles out two
hickory pegs (Plate 76) and slides them into place (Plate 77). These "keys"
keep the bows from sliding out.
PLATE 78 
Will Zoellner, a local blacksmith, worked for years with the
Babcock Lumber Company on Nantahala both driving steers for them and
hewing new yokes whenever one split. He made the above yoke for us according
to his own personal pattern. It is hewn out of poplar (though he also uses
sassafras and sweet gum), and would have been used with heavy steers that
were already broken in. The yoke measures 44 inches long, and is 7 1/4 inches
thick at the belly.

"BEEN MAKIN' WAGON WHEELS
ABOUT FIFTY YEAR' "
mazing" was all I could
say as I watched black-
smith John Conley fit
piece by piece of our wagon wheel perfectly together. Every small
detail was completed with skill and accuracy, and an ease that comes
from having made his first wheel over fifty years ago. This accuracy
has always been a part of John Conley's works, and it continues to be
so. After he had all of the felloes sawed out and mounted, for example,
he noticed that the pattern he had been using was a little off: its
curvature was a little tight, thus creating a slightly scalloped circle
instead of a perfectly round one. It wouldn't really have mattered,
but rather than have an imperfect piece of work leave his shop, John
went back one night, removed all the old felloes, cut a new pattern
and new felloes, and remounted them. The next day, when we went
in to watch him put the tire on, he didn't even mention what he had
done until we noticed the difference. He wanted everything, he ex-
plained, "done right."
John has modernized his blacksmith shop in many ways, adding
arc welders, electric drills, and a pattern lathe to cut both wagon
wheel spokes and tool handles; but he was able, and willing, to show
us the old methods as he worked with his newer tools. These differ-
ences are cited in the captions for the photographs that follow.
He also patiently explained many of the whys involved in the proc-
ess. The spokes, for example, are oval-shaped instead of being per-
fectly round. This gives them a tremendous amount of additional
strength.
And the reason the spokes are "dished" was also explained a
number of times. This is, in fact, the touchiest part of the job.
Much of it has to do with the way the hub's mortises are cut.
Traditionally, the hubs (made, as the rest of the wheel, out of u n -
seasoned oak or hickory) were turned on a lathe, and the mortises
(twelve for the front hubs and fourteen for the larger, weight-carry-
ing back wheels) were cut with a wood chisel. The mortises had a

============================================================
PAGE 115
============================================================

WAGON WHEELS AND WAGONS
half-inch slope on one side (see diagram later) to create the "dish"
in the spokes. That dish curved toward the inside of the wagon so
that, as more and more weight was added and the hubs were forced
outward, the spokes would straighten up rather than bow out. This
was especially important, too, when the wagon was riding on sloped
ground. If the wheels weren't dished, then as the load shifted toward
the downhill side of the wagon, the wheels would bow outward and
split apart.
A pretty intricate task, all in all. And hard to explain. We hope the
following photographs and diagrams make it somewhat clear.
STAN ECHOLS
PLATE 79 
John used a factory-turned hub for our wheel—ready for use
except for the addition of the four bands. Traditionally the hubs would be
turned on a foot-powered lathe, and the slots for the spokes cut with a sharp
chisel. Here, the hub is ready for the last band to be added.
PLATE 80 The steel stock for the band is chosen, measured, bent in a vise,
and the ends welded together.

============================================================

PLATES 81—82 
Now the rough edges left by the weld are ground off. The
band is next heated red-hot in the forge, driven onto the moistened hub, and
then doused with water to make it contract and hold.

============================================================
PAGE 117
============================================================

PLATE 83 
The blocks for the spokes were cut from oak that had seasoned
two years.
PLATE 84 The spokes were turned on a pattern lathe. Years ago, they would
have been carved out with a drawing knife.

============================================================
PAGE 118
============================================================

PLATES 85-89 
The bases of the twelve spokes are now shaped, as shown in
Plates 85-89. These are the "tenons" that fit the twelve slots, or "mortises,"
cut in the hub. First the draw knife cuts across the grain to the desired depth
(Plate 85); then the knife is held parallel to the grain of the wood and struck
with an axe or hammer (Plate 86). The back of the spoke is then sloped to
work against the slope of the mortise (Plate 87), and the edges tapered so the
tenon will slip easily into the mortise (Plate 88).

A pattern is made for the wooden rim of the wheel (Plate 90),

Next the spokes are driven into the mortises in the hub. No
nails or glue are needed. The slope of the mortises in the hub automatically
creates the required "dish."
PLATES 98-100 
Now the ends of the spokes are shaped to receive the felloes.
First, a spoke pointer {Plate 98) points the ends to guide the spoke auger {Plate
99) onto a true course. The latter tool turns the end of the spoke into a dowel
to receive the felloe.

PLATES 101-102 
When the spokes are ready, the felloes are laid, section by
section, on the ends of the spokes, and marked on their inside curves so holes
for the ends of the spokes can be drilled in the proper places. Once drilled, the
felloes are mounted in place. John calls the tool he is using a "spoke puller." It
pulls the spokes closer together so they can fit the holes in the inside of the
felloes. As the felloe is driven on (Plate 102), the spokes spread back apart into
their natural positions.
PLATE 103 
When the felloes are in
place, John takes a hand saw and saws
down between each seam to insure that
they meet flush, and are lined up correctly.

With a traveler, John checks the circumference of both
the wheel and the metal "tire" to make sure the fit is good. The tire should
be about a half-inch smaller in inside circumference than the outside circum-
ference of the wheel itself. This insures a tight fit.

PLATES 107-109 
The tire that John had planned to use on our wheel was
too large, so he cut out a section (Plate 107), rewelded it carefully back together
on top and bottom (Plate 108), and ground off the rough edges (Plate 109).
PLATE 110 Now he gets the tire red-hot in his
forge. He moves the tire about a foot at a time
through the flames until it has gone about four com-
plete, very slow revolutions.

Moving quickly, he carries the tire to the wheel, has a
second person clamp down on the opposite side to keep the tire from flipping
up (Plate HI), and pulls the tire over the rim of the wheel with a "tire
puller" (Plates 112-113).

As the wood smokes from
the heat, he pounds the tire down
evenly all the way around and douses it

THE FOXFIRE WAGON
After the wheel was finished for our collection, and we had marveled
at the ingenuity of the construction, we naturally thought about what
a job it must have been to make a complete wagon using only hand
tools. We went to talk to Will Zoellner, who used to make wagons, to
see if he could show us how.
He did even better. He had just located a wagon he had made in
1926, and he offered to get it for us if we wanted it. The wagon had
changed owners five times since its construction, and it had come
back to Will several times for repairs. This time he repaired it for the
last time as it is now in our museum, never to change hands again.
Will went over every piece in detail with us. The following photo-
graphs and diagrams provide a pattern which will yield an exact du-
plicate of Will's model.

MAKING A TUB WHEEL-
SAM BURTON SHOWS US HOW
remember saying, "I could
probably work the rest of my
life and not come up with
anything like that." Those were my exact words when I saw what Sam
Burton had made with one section of a huge white pine and two black
locust pegs. He had used only a hammer, a chisel, a chain saw, a tape
measure, an auger, and an axe, but his skill with these was amazing.
As all of us watched and talked and played with Mose and Booger
(Sam's two dogs), he went to work, barefoot, chopping and cutting
and marking and hammering and telling us stories all the while:
"I had a hog up here that weighed about three hunderd
pounds. I said, 'Major, I got a hog up here I want t'kill to-
morrow.'
"He said, 'Why tomorrow?'
"I says, Th'moon's a'shrinkin' so th'meat'll shrink.'
"He rared back and laughed. He says, 'Th'moon only con-
trols one thing.'
"I says, 'What's that0'
"He says, 'It controls th'oceans.'
"I says, 'If it controls as big a thing as th'ocean, it probably
controls that pig I got up there too!' On th'growin'of th'moon
—when it's sure enough grovvin'—there's no kiddin' about it.
You can kill a hog and his meat'll puff. If th'moon's in th'last
quarter a'shrinkin', hit'll shrink up. Hit'll all fry away. All

th'grease'll come out. 'At makes sense. When you render
th'Iard out, you can tell. If th'moon's growin', when your
cracklin's come out, they'll be soft and puffy."
We stayed all day, and he had just gotten started on the buckets
of the wheel. Then we had to stop because it was getting late in
the day and Sam had other work to get done.
Sam called us whenever he had time to work on the wheel. We'd
go over and watch and talk. He always worked patiently, like the
real craftsman he is.
It took time, and lots of it, but soon the wheel was done. It is
a beautiful thing—totally handmade. Sam says he would like to
get some yellow poplar and make another wheel from that. "I
wouldn't mind taking as much as two months . . ." That kind of
attitude—plus the respect we learned not only for good tools kept
sharp and clean, but also for a good piece of wood—made the whole
thing quite an experience.
The latter point was especially well illustrated when Sam came
across a piece of wire imbedded firmly in the center of the wood. No
matter which way he chiseled and cut, the wire followed him.
Getting it out so that it wouldn't dull his tools was a process that
took the better part of an afternoon, and we tape-recorded most of
his comments. Here, in sequence, are many of his statements regard-
ing the wire he was fighting with:
"Looks like a piece a'metal here. I done hit it with th'circle
saw when I was cuttin' out this piece a'timber. It growed in
where somebody hung it on when th'tree'uz young. That's
th'reason th'Forest Service, when you go t'a campground,
don't want you t'carry a hatchet or a nail. Wire's just as bad
wrapped around a tree. I'm goin' t'see if I can work it out. If
I can, I'll start drillin'. If I can't, I'll have t'cut around it. I
actually hit a railroad spike one time [when he was running a
sawmill]. I'd done squared th'log down. Them saw rings and
discs just went ever'where! [He pulls a piece of the wire out
after chiseling around it.] They wrapped it around this limb.
It probably goes all th'way t'th'center. Depends on how big
th'tree was when they hung it up on it. No tellin' what th'di-
ameter was. It must've been about four inches when it was
wrapped on there, and th'tree just grew on. Now that's a
shame t'do that to a good piece of wood! . . . If air could'a
hit it, rust would've eat it up by now. I'll have t'sharpen this
chisel again anyhow, but I don't want t'ruin it by hittin' that

============================================================

anymore . . . Hope I 'bout got that piece a'wire. I guess I
have. No. See where that wood's dark there? I guess inside
there's another piece of it. I hit it in this bucket, and I'll hit it
in th'next'un. That wire'uz wrapped around that tree when
it'uz small. It wadn't nailed t'th'tree at all. Grandpa Watts
taught me how t'make these wheels. If he'd a'run into this
wire back in his days, he'd a'gone and got another tree. Back
then you could find timber . . . Look. That's hay balin' wire.
That's exactly what that is. They tied somethin' t'this tree
with that hay balin' wire . . . I don't know what I'm goin'
t'do with this wire yet [several hours later]. I cut it again. I
believe I'm goin' t'get it. But I'll likely hit it again. It goes on
down in there. And y'see? Right here's a resin pocket. That's
because th'wood was bruised somehow while it was growin'
. . . That tree was actually three inches in diameter when that
wire was hung around it. You can see where it's colored
th'wood blue. It couldn't a'been hung over waist high . . .
That wire makes a lot a'work; it sure 'nough does . . . That
wire just follows me around ever'where I go. I can't get shed
a'it."
Finally Sam did get "shed a'it," but listening to him fight it, we
learned more about wood than from any text we had ever read. And
we won't be wrapping wire around young trees anymore—that's for
sure.
For those of you not familiar with a tub wheel, it serves exactly the
same purpose as either an overshot or undershot mill wheel. Once very
common in this area, it is now almost extinct, as are the men who can
still make them. In fact, we know of not one single mill where a wheel
of this type is still in operation. Luckily, at the Grandpa Watts mill
near Clarkesville, Georgia—a fine old building now the studio of Glen
and John LaRowe and the home of their shop, the Mark of the Potter
—we found the remnants of a tub wheel still in place {Plates 155—
161). We also got word there of Sam Burton, who had made the one
that now lay, rotting, in the basement. The rest you know.
The instructions for making such a wheel can be found on the
following pages. There are several pieces of information that should
be noted before starting.
First, the wheel illustrated here is made of two slabs of wood. That's
because there aren't any trees left big enough to allow it to be made
out of one. A wheel of larger diameter can be made out of three
pieces joined together in exactly the same fashion as illustrated on the
following pages.

============================================================
PAGE 141
============================================================

MAKING A TUB WHEEL
Second, such wheels were usually made out of soft wood like pine
or poplar. The theory was that the water striking the wheel carried
sand. If the sand struck soft wood, particles would become imbedded
in the wood itself, and it wouldn't be long before the surfaces would
be coated with sand and thus be more resistant to further wear. Sand
striking hard wood will not become imbedded in the wood, but will
continue to sand it away until the blades are almost paper thin.
Third, the buckets are shaped so that their openings in the bottom
of the wheel are larger than their openings in the top. Sam explained
the reason for this: "You make th'buckets bigger at th'bottom so
they'll not hold water. It'll drop on out and be out a'th'way. After
you use that water, th'quicker you can get through with it, th'better
you are at not havin' to carry it. If you don't fix it where it'll [the
water] drop out, th'bucket'll come back around t'where th'spout hits
it again and if it's full a'water, you hadn't got any power. Now they
made one over here at Hiawassee, and when it'd come back around,
it wouldn't pull. When it come back around, th'buckets was all full.
If it's carryin' its first load back around, it's pullin' somethin' *it
doesn't need. That water's gotta dump out right away as th'wheel
turns."
Fourth, the wheel is set so that it turns from east to west. As
Sam said, "Th'wheel goes th'same way th'sunrise does. All millstones
turn that way. If they don't, there's somethin' wrong. Most ever'thing,
even a tap, turns that way."
Fifth, if you make such a wheel, it should be cut out of green
wood and kept in water to prevent cracking. Ours is soaking in
polyethylene glycol, thanks to suggestions by Dr. Sam Stanley of the
Smithsonian and Dr. Joe W. Clark, Pathologist. That should save it.
MIKE COOK
PLATE 126 Sam begins by cutting a slab of
white pine (seven feet long by eighteen inches
wide by nine inches thick) into two thirty-
seven-inch-long slabs. He sets the excess aside.

============================================================
PAGE 142
============================================================

PLATES 127-128 
With the boring auger shown in detail in Plate 127, he
drills two holes in the side of each slab. The holes are two inches in diameter
and six inches deep. These holes will hold the pegs that will pin the two slabs
together, so their locations must be plotted exactly before drilling. To do this,
Sam finds the dead center of the two sides that will be drilled. Then, on a
line exactly bisecting the width of the slab, he locates two points, each six inches
from center. The two points, then, are exactly twelve inches apart, and on a line
that passes through dead center on each slab. Doing this to two sides gives the
locations for the centers of the four holes to be drilled.
PLATE 129 
With the holes drilled,
Sam sets the slabs together, drilled
sides up, to make sure the holes align
properly.

============================================================
PAGE 143
============================================================

PLATE 130 
He then cuts two pegs
out of black locust to fit the holes. The
pegs are approximately eleven inches
long and one and three-quarters inches
square. He trims off the corners slightly
with the axe but leaves the pegs more
square than round. This way, they will
jam more tightly into the holes and hold
far better than if they were simply round
dowels. This is the same technique used
whenever pegging log cabins together.
PLATE 131 
Next, he drives the
pegs into place in one of the two
slabs. Note: In later steps, when the
buckets are being cut out, these pins
will be cut into. By that time, how-
ever, the two slabs will be held to-
gether by two iron hoops.

PLATE 134 Sam now finds dead center of
the top surface. He drives a nail through a
stick of scrap wood into dead center, measures
out eighteen inches from dead center on the
stick, and drives a second nail through this
point. With the point of the second nail, he
scribes a circle thirty-six inches in diameter
on the top surface.
PLATE 135 
Now, using the same
method, two more circles are scribed
(see arrows)—one measuring seven
inches and the other fifteen and a
half inches from dead center on the
stick . . .

which he drilled both lighten the work

PLATE 143 
In the second bucket,
Sam finds a piece of wire sticking out
of the middle of the wood. Here he
tries to ease it out without dulling the
edge of his chisel.
PLATE 144 With the top halves of
the first two buckets roughed out,
Sam turns the wheel up on its side
and outlines the bottom halves. For
measurements and a diagram of the
bottom side of the wheel, see Plate
154.
PLATE 145 
The outline drawn, Sam eases the wheel over bottom side up
and begins to chisel from the bottom. The rows of holes he has drilled all the
way through (the row of nine-inch holes) act as a guide, as do the lines he has
drawn. While working, he goes slowly and carefully so as not to cut through one
of the blades. He must also be careful to slope each one correctly.

============================================================
PAGE 148
============================================================

PLATE 146 
With the four buckets
that cut across the grain roughed out,
Sam now takes two iron wagon wheel
rims, each thirty-six inches in diam-
eter, builds a fire around them (one
can use hickory, corn cobs, or any-
thing else that burns evenly and
well), and gets them red-hot.
PLATES 147-148 
The hoops are then carried to the wheel, red-hot, with
hooks, eased over the top, and pounded into place with hammers. Often the
hoops are so hot they set the wood afire.

============================================================
PAGE 149
============================================================

PLATE 149 
Steam boils off the heated
iron band as Sam sprays it with water
to cool it and make it contract. As the
bands contract, they pull the two halves
of the wheel so tightly together that
even if the pins holding them get com-
pletely severed while the buckets are be-
ing cut (as happens in a forty-eight-inch
wheel that is made with three separate
slabs), it will make no difference. If the
finished wheel is kept wet or treated
while green with polyethylene glycol, it
will keep without air-cracking or split-
ting for years. The bands on, Sam can
now cut the four remaining buckets.
These buckets, which run with the
grain, might split if cut earlier.

pletion, Sam points out certain features
to Mike Cook, who has videotaped the
whole process.

et's make us one—make
th'shavin's fly! I got a
| deerskin up there in
th'barn if you boys'ud cut it up fer me and make strips out of it. We'll
nail it together and make us one, huh? It's simple. Real simple."
This was Minyard Connor's response when we asked him how a
foot-powered lathe worked; and we were more than glad to oblige
him.
The foot-powered lathe is a completely hand-built, muscle-powered
machine that has been out of use ever since electric lathes—and other
tools that made woodwork easier and faster—became common. After
operating the foot-powered lathe myself, I can see why it is rarely
used anymore.
The main purpose of this lathe was to make chair rounds, bed posts
and table legs. Though it is fairly simple to construct, it takes a lot
of patience to work with one for very long. But that is one of the
wonders of the mountain people—their patience.
It was after several attempts to set up an interview with Minyard
(he was always out logging or fishing, it seemed) that we finally got
one in early March. When we first heard of the foot-powered lathe,
neither George nor Jimmy nor myself had any idea what it would
look like; but when it was finally built and we had all tried it out,
we were glad we had carried the interview through to the end.
After we had finished the interview, Mike, Paul, and Frank dropped
by Minyard's to see how things looked. Minyard sat on a stump,
loosened up, and started telling jokes. That's when I really felt the
interview had been a success—I'd made a friend.

PLATE 168 
The "H"-shaped frame for the lathe is two upright, seven-foot-
long 2X4's and a horizontal beam; and two wooden brackets—a hole on the
inside surface of each—for holding the stock to be turned.
PLATE 169 
One-inch-wide strips of deerhide are cut as long as the hide will
allow and drawn rapidly back and forth across a metal rod (or horseshoe
mounted to a wall as shown here) to loosen them up and make them pliable.
Here Minyard has handed one strip to Greg to work, George holds a second,
and Minyard slices out a third. When enough strips have been cut to make a
twelve-foot length, they are tied together. As will be seen, one end is attached
to the spring pole overhead, and the other is attached to the foot pedal.

PLATE 170 
The 
frame 
finished,
the foot pedal is now mounted to it.
Choose two four-foot 2X4S. Here
Minyard sharpens one end of each so
they can be driven into the ground.
(Note: As in Plate 171, they are
driven into the ground on a slant,
about shoulder width, or 3/2 feet,
apart.)
PLATE 171 
When the braces for
the pedal are in place beside the
frame, Greg Strickland drills a hole
through both with a brace and bit.
PLATE 172 
The pedal itself is a two-foot-long
2X4, a hole drilled through it six inches from one
end. It is set in place between the two braces, and
held by a bolt that goes through it and the two holes
Greg drilled in the braces. With the pedal in place,
one end of the deerskin rope is wired to the center of
the pedal.

============================================================
PAGE 163
============================================================

PLATE 174 A piece of stock
to be turned for a chair round
is sharpened on either end so
the brackets can hold it. The
spring pole is, in this case, a
springy green oak pole mounted
horizontally in the barn loft
above the lathe. Its base is
firmly anchored, and a bale of
hay is set under it about four
feet from its anchored end to
tilt it upward and add to its
spring.
PLATE 173 With one end of
the hide securely wired to the
pedal 
(as shown) 
and the
other end 
attached 
to 
the
spring pole (Plate 177), the
lathe is ready to use.
PLATE 175 
The stock is twisted
once in the deerhide, and its ends
inserted into the two brackets de-
signed to hold them. Depressing the
foot pedal with the stock "fouled" in
the deerskin spins the stock so it can
be worked.

PLATE 178 
Walter Shellnut also uses a foot-powered lathe for the chairs he
makes, but his lathe is different from Minyard's in some respects. For one thing,
he uses rope instead of deerhide (Plate 179). He claims neither he nor his
father (who taught him how to use the lathe and make chairs) had any luck
with the hide, as it slipped too much.

PLATE 180 
The foot pedal on Wal-
ter's lathe is of completely different de-
sign, as seen here, but it operates the
same. The piles of shavings beneath the
lathe bear witness to how much it is
used.
PLATE 181 
Of special note are the
two end pieces that hold the stock being
turned. Rather than being mounted
permanently on the vertical support
beams, as on Minyard's lathe, these are
cross-shaped pieces that slide back and
forth between two horizontal beams (as
shown here and in Plate 180) so that
stock of varying lengths can be worked.
The stock is held on either end by a
metal spike driven through each cross-
shaped end piece.

RAISING SHEEP
n our fathers' and grandfa-
thers' time, raising sheep was
an important factor in weav-
ing, for without wool for yarn, clothing could not be woven. Even
though there aren't many people who still weave their own clothes,
there are a few left who raise sheep. This chapter was made possible by
these few people who took time to talk and share their memories with us.
Through several interviews with five contacts, we acquired a wealth
of information on raising and shearing sheep. The people interviewed
—Minnie Buchanan, Claude Darnell, Belle Dryman, George Grist, and
Gertrude Keener—have either raised sheep sometime during their
lifetimes, or have memories of their parents raising sheep.
Minnie Buchanan now has a weaving shop near Highlands, North
Carolina, enabling her to bring in an income, as well as to weave
for her own personal needs.
Claude Darnell, living in these surrounding mountains, works at
the Jay Hambidge Art Foundation. The Foundation is a school that
teaches the art of weaving. They raise and shear their own sheep,
providing their wool to weave. Claude's job is tending the sheep and
managing the grounds.
Belle Dryman, living in North Carolina, does not raise sheep.
However, her father did when she was a young girl.
George Grist has been raising sheep for about forty years. As a
young boy, George learned how to raise sheep from his father.

Gertrude Keener, a retired art teacher from the Tallulah Falls High
School, also had parents who raised sheep. Today you will find
Gertrude busy at her loom, weaving for others as well as for herself.
By talking with these people, we learned the ways of the old moun-
tain sheep, how they were raised and cared for, and how they were
sheared.
The sheep which were grown years ago for wool were a smaller and
hardier strain than the sheep of today. They weighed only about
thirty to forty pounds and were no bigger than an average size dog; yet
they were stout little creatures that withstood cold, hunger, and dis-
ease in the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains. But they were
also shy, timid animals whose only source of protection from wild
animals was to flee in fear. If they were attacked by an animal, they
would usually give up and let the attacker kill them. Once they were
caught and scared, they just gave up without a fight.
For the most part these sheep were white, but a few black sheep
were born. George Grist, a sheep producer in Rabun County, said,
"They were white. They didn't hardly have any black on'em. Back
yonder most of'em had a black sheep or two crop out. They wanted
that 'cause they'd weave socks and sweaters out of'em and they
wouldn't have to dye it." This is a classic example of utilizing what is
available. The farmers like to have a black sheep born every now and
then, but sometimes superstitions grow around black sheep. Not ac-
cording to George Grist, who, when asked if he knew of any super-
stitions, replied, "I don't know of any superstitions, but you always
heard of black sheep in the family."
When the contacts were asked where the first sheep came from,
no one knew for sure, but George Grist stated, "I guess if there'd
been sheep here, they'd brought'em where they came from. I'd imagine
they brought'em here from England. I got some shears from Sheffield,
England. I believe that's where the first sheep came from."
It was hard to obtain sheep if you wanted to buy more to increase
your flock. Here's what Minnie Buchanan said on obtaining sheep:
"Well, you couldn't hardly find'em then. Most folks just kept what
they wanted. Then in later years they got to where they kept th'sheep
for th'lambs to sell in th'spring. But most everybody back when I was
growing up just kept what sheep they had of their own. If they got a
bigger flock, they jest had to raise'em. 'Course the sheep didn't cost
nothing a head then—about two, two an'a half dollars. They jest
didn't have no market sale."

Years ago almost everyone raised sheep. If some family didn't have
any sheep, some of their relatives would and they usually shared the
surplus wool.
Sheep were relatively easy to raise as they could forage for them-
selves. Since it was open range here years ago, farmers simply fenced
in their gardens, and then turned their cattle, hogs, and sheep loose
in the hills to graze. The animals would stay together, and were
branded with some identifiable marking; then rounded up when
they were needed. As Minnie Buchanan said, "We'd turn our sheep
out in the spring and they'd go to the mountains. Maybe they'd come
back in the field onst in a while, but not very often in the summer.
In the fall, we'd git out and hunt'em up and bring'em through the
winter."
When sheep roamed free in the mountains, the sheep producers
needed a way to identify their sheep. Minnie Buchanan told us, "We
notched their ears and that mark was registered at Franklin, North
Carolina, and I guess it's right there yet." When asked if she could
remember her father's mark, she wasn't sure, but she thinks it could
have been an "overbit." She explained what an overbit looked like:
"It's a notch on the top of the ear; if it's on the underside, it's an 'un-
derbit.' A 'crop' is just the end of the ear clipped off."
George Grist said about ear markings, "They'd cut the ears to tell
everyone's sheep apart. Lots of time they would split their ears—what
they call a 'swallow fork.' They'd split the ear, either the right or the
left one, and then cut off the end of the ears and call it a 'swallow
fork with a clip'; or they'd notch under the ears, two or three

notches. Everybody around had their own mark and they could teU'em
apart that way. Then they turned'em loose in the woods. All summer
they'd go a long ways off and stay. They'd come home about once a
month for salt. We wouldn't take salt to'em on account of we were
afraid they wouldn't come back."
When we asked George how they could be sure the sheep would
come home, he replied, "Well, they gotta come home, just like we do.
When they want something, they come home. You see, they won't
hardly come home unless they feel a need for something. You don't
need a fence for'em. If anything gets after'em, they know to come
home. They wanna have a place at night to stay—about the same
place usually. I heard my daddy say that they'd come back; one morn-
ing he'd wake up and they'd all be back. They'd give'em salt and look
about'em and in two, three days they'd be gone."
If the sheep weren't home when the owner needed them for some
reason, they'd have to be hunted up. When Minnie's father wanted
his sheep, he sent his children to hunt them out of the woods: "Us
kids'd get out an' sheep hunt in the fall. Sometimes we'd find'em
maybe five miles from home. Well, there'd probably be somebody
else's sheep with'em, but we'd jest bring'em all in together an' then let
them come and get theirs. An' they'd always put a bell on one an'
they knowed that there bell."
Of course, not everyone let their sheep run loose in the mountains.
Some people, like Belle Dryman's father, kept their sheep fenced in
pastures. This eliminated the problems of hunting for the sheep and
notching the ears to identify his sheep from the other men's; but then
again, fences had to be built and pastures had to be kept in grazing
condition. When the sheep were fenced, the best pasture grasses were
blue grasses and various types of rye grass for winter grazing. The
sheep preferred this softer, more tender grass to the coarse hays or
fescue.
Care of the sheep in the summer was relatively easy: just pasture or
mountain range, water, and a little salt. The sheep would do fine in
the summer with just a little care, but during the winter months
things were different. All the contacts agreed on keeping their sheep in
a barn during heavy snows and severe cold spells, but the food given to
the sheep by their various owners varied a little. Here are the different
accounts of winter feeding by the different contacts.
Minnie Buchanan: "It don't take much to feed a sheep. Feed'em
corn, hay, corn fodder, blades off cane, 'r jest anythang like that to

============================================================
PAGE 172
============================================================

176 
FOXFIRE 2
fill'em up. Lots of people claim that corn would make'em shed their
wool but I don't know whether it would."
Belle Dryman: "We had to feed'em fodder 'cause we'uns didn't
have no hay back then; nobody did. We had a shelter for'em an' had
to feed'n water'em in the winter time."
George Grist: "They'd come home 'round closer to the fields dur-
ing the winter. Some of em had sheds for'em. The bad winter months
the sheep'd come home, but they'd eat acorns up till Christmas; but
if a snow came they would eat ivy [mountain laurel] and that'd kill'em.
Back yonder they'd feed'em corn. They wouldn't do good if they didn't
eat something green. They like a fine grass more than they do a coarse
grass. They like a blue grass or anything wild."
Gertrude Keener: "The sheep were brought into th'barn in a lot.
Everybody had what they called a 'sheep house,' an' they always
fed'em corn, and a lot of times they had rye. They'd let their sheep
graze in th'fields in the winter time and early spring. We'd fasten'em
up maybe at night and feed'em corn—shelled corn is one of the best
things—and a fodder 'cause we didn't raise hay then."
Claude Darnell: Claude kept his sheep in the barn all winter except
for a small pasture, and fed the sheep corn, hay, and cottonseed meal
as winter foods.
Rams were needed to continue the existence of the herds. To keep
from interbreeding the sheep year after year with the same ram, the
neighboring farmers would swap their rams with one another. In do-
ing so, deformed sheep and undesirable characteristics and traits were
not common. George Grist said that his father kept one ram for every
twenty ewes, and when they had a surplus of rams, "they killed
PLATE 185

hillsides many years ago.

177
an'ate'em. That's about all you could do with'em, except maybe
for wethers." Wethers were castrated rams which were slaughtered for
mutton when they grew into a desired size. The size depended on how
much meat you could use before it spoiled. There was one problem
concerning mutton: there was no feasible way to preserve it. When-
ever you needed meat to eat, you had to go out and butcher a lamb.
It had to be eaten right away due to spoilage, unless it was killed in
the winter. Several of the contacts stated that salt would spoil the meat
and there was no way to cure or preserve it. "They'd castrate'em and
let'em grow until they needed'em. Maybe it'd get two, three, or four
years old. Maybe if they wanted one when the sheep came in, in the
summer, they'd get one. They'd get an old one. They'd never get a
young one 'cause he wouldn't weigh much. You see, they only weighed
thirty to forty pounds full grown. It took'em a year or two to get big.
They'd let one get big and fat. Maybe they'd weigh sixty or seventy
pounds."
At times the rams would fight but usually they would get along. The
old mountain rams had large curved horns and sometimes they would
lock their horns together and starve to death in the woods before they
could unlock their horns.
In the spring along about March the sheep begin to have their off-
spring. This is what George Grist had to say about lambs and their
mothers: "The old type would nurse their young. Now anything that
you improve, you run into problems. They take those old mountain
sheep and improve'em so they have more wool and mutton, and now
they're not as good mothers. Sometimes they don't wanna claim'em
and then you gotta make'em nurse. Those old sheep would hold their
jug up for'em and push the baby to it and just tell'em, 'you either get
it or you die.' And some of these others [improved sheep] just look at
their babies and smeU'em and paw at'em. And the older type, no mat-
ter how cold it gets, they'd clean that baby up and dry it with her
mouth. They'd hold their breath right next to'em and keep her baby
warm, and some of the newer ones won't do it."
Gertrude Keener, when asked about raising lambs, said, "Some-
times they'd have twins, an' I've heard of'em havin' triplets, but
usually when they had triplets one was kinda weak and the mother'd
discard it. You'd have t'take it in an' raise it on a bottle. I raised two
little lambs on bottles."
Sometimes the ewe would disown her lamb and if she did, it would
have to be bottle fed in order to survive. If a mother ewe died, the lamb

PLATES 186—187

would be shut up with another ewe and the ewe would be forced to
nurse the orphan lamb. The majority of the contacts at one time or
another have raised orphan sheep with a bottle and a lot of loving
care. Claude Darnell said, "I raised one all the way one time till it was
grown. Then I took it out to the barn. It lived. That beat anything I
ever seen. It'd follow me through the house and if I'd get away he'd
just bleat."
Sheep will produce wool as long as they are in good health and still
have their teeth (the condition of their teeth being one indication of
their general health). George Grist explained the life expectancy of
sheep and how they cut their teeth: "They go about as long as their
teeth last. They grow two teeth a year. They're born with their baby
teeth and two teeth a year for four years. When they get eight big
teeth in the front, they was four years old. Then they go for about two-
three years and those teeth break and give way. Their life is not too
long after that. Sheep live maybe eight to ten years."
Shearing took place once every year in the spring, and sometimes
again in the early fall if the weather permitted and there was enough

============================================================
PAGE 175
============================================================

FROM RAISING SHEEP TO WEAVING CLOTH 
179
wool on the sheep to make it worth while. Minnie Buchanan remem-
bered the methods used by her father: "They sheared'em in the spring,
then again about September most of th'time. Some of th'time they
would not shear'em but onct a year; but generally they'd shear'em in
the spring jest soon as it got warm enough till they could stand it on in
the fall before it got too awful cold."
Years ago when sheep were sheared by hand, a good shearer could
shear about forty head a day with assistance from someone who would
help hold the sheep. The different contacts related different amounts
of time required to shear sheep. Belle Dryman's father sheared about
one sheep every fifteen-twenty minutes, but Gertrude Keener remem-
bers that shearing by the old method with hand shears took about an
hour to shear one sheep. Claude Darnell, another sheep raiser, said
sheep could be sheared in three minutes with electric shears, but he
could not remember exactly the time required when using hand shears.
From these facts I'd imagine the time required to shear a sheep with
hand shears depends on the ability of the shearer.
This is the way that Gertrude Keener remembers shearing sheep.
"Y'start on th'stomach and shear'em, and y'just peel th'wool back. It
just comes off in a big layer. It's like skinning an animal. Off a'th'big
ones, you could get a pound or two of wool. That'd be quite a bit. I
knowed you'd get at least a pound."
Other contacts figured that you got a little more wool than a pound
per sheep—closer to two or two and one-half pounds. It varies from
sheep to sheep but averages anywhere around one to three pounds of
wool per sheep, compared to today's sheep with six to eight pounds of
wool. That is a relatively low figure, but sheep back then were smaller
and there wasn't any wool on the tail or legs.
After the sheep were sheared, the wool had to be washed and pre-
pared for carding and spinning. This was done by washing it in warm
to hot water with lye soap. The wool was very greasy and the water
needed to be fairly hot, but not boiling, because that would ruin the
wool. After it was washed, it was customary to place the wool on clean
rocks to dry. Once the wool had been washed and dried, it lost about
half its weight. Then it was ready to be stored for later use.
The following photographs show the actual process of shearing
sheep. We couldn't get any photographs of shearing sheep the old way
(no one shears their sheep by hand anymore); but we did take pic-
tures of sheep being sheared by the new electric methods.

When the contacts were asked if their forefathers ever used sheep
dogs, they unanimously agreed that sheep dogs weren't too common
up in the mountains. The sheep either came home on their own or
you hunted them out of the hills on foot. When we asked the follow-
ing contacts if their fathers had sheep dogs, they replied:
Minnie Buchanan: "He just had us young'uns, two-legged dogs.
I've heard of people with sheep dogs, but Dad never did have nothin'
like that. Us kids done th'takin' care of th'sheep."
Belle Dryman: "No, we didn't have no sheep dogs. 'Course we only
had a few [sheep]. People generally didn't have sheep dogs."
George Grist: "No, I don't think so. Th'sheep just come home on
their own accord."
Here are some statements from the various contacts on wild animals
which bothered their sheep:
Minnie Buchanan: "Once in a while there was an old shepherd dog
that'd kiU'em. My daddy had a dog that was half shepherd. I thought
it was an awful fine dog. He got off with some more dogs and got after
some sheep and he [her father] didn't wait till he killed any. He just
took him [the dog] out and killed'im. 'Cause if they ever killed a sheep
they say you can't break'em. That's what they said—you can't
break'em."
Claude Darnell: "We lost sixteen one time. Just to the neighbors'
dogs. The dogs got after'em one time in the bottom. Just ran'em in the
creek and drowned'em. Didn't try t'eat none of'em."

============================================================
PAGE 179
============================================================

FROM RAISING SHEEP TO WEAVING CLOTH 
183
Belle Dryman: "Well now, the dogs used t'kiU'em and I used t'call
them sheep-killin' dogs."
George Grist: "The wildcats would get'em. Wildcats were the worst
but you used to have lots of wild dogs and things like that which would
keep the wildcats run back. When the sheep got too far back, then
th'wildcats got'em. The sheep will move back when th'cats bother'em.
They got a whole lotta sense about things like that. If anything
bothers'em, they come back home and they won't go to anybody else's
house—jest their own wherever they're raised."
Gertrude Keener: "Bobcats is bad on killin' th'lambs. Dogs is
th'worst things. Wild dogs or somebody's pet dogs'll kill two'r'three at
night. I guess they would eat'em, but they tasted th'blood an'they
just wanted t'kill'em. They were sheep killers, and a lot a'times one dog
would kill two'r'three—a bunch a'sheep in one night."
The sheep which ran free in the mountains were relatively disease
free. The only external parasites were ticks. The wool was so thick and
greasy that only a tick could bother the sheep. Some of the sicknesses
of sheep were described as follows.
Minnie Buchanan: "They might get what they call the 'rots'—cold
in their head. They'd get over it when spring came. We never did doc-
tor no sheep. Sheep had to take care of theirselves."
Claude Darnell: "They get the worms and to cure'em, feed cotton
meal. It's got medicine in it t'kill th'worms."
George Grist: "They didn't have many diseases back then. Once in
a while they'd get th'milk sick. This is the only country in the world
that has milk sick. When the sheep got it, they'd die. Not all of'em
would get it, but some would and died." [Little is known about the
milk sickness. No one knows exactly where it comes from, but most
think it is caused by a plant that sheep and cows sometimes find in
dark coves and eat. An epidemic of milk sickness may occur one year
and then disappear for a period of seven or eight years before recur-
ring.]
The men and women who raised sheep many years ago were a
sturdy, independent type of people. They raised sheep because they
had to. They couldn't run out to the nearest store and buy clothing or
material. This emphasized how important sheep raising was. Without
wool, clothing, blankets, and woven goods could not be made. This
type of independence is what made the people in this region so unique.

CARDING AND SPINNING
For many years the mountain people made their own clothing with
hand-spun thread. Before the wool can be spun, it must be washed and
carded. Most of the people we interviewed recommended washing the
wool twice, both times in detergent and warm water, and rinsing in
cold water. If washed too much, the oil will be washed out and the
wool cannot be spun.
Carding is the process of breaking up the wool and preparing it to
be spun. There are two sets of cards: the "breaking cards," which be-
gin to separate the fibers; and the "fine cards," which comb the wool
into rolls for spinning. A corn shuck or paper is used for the core of
the bobbin and the wool is spun on it. When the wool has been spun,
the full bobbin is simply slipped off the spinning wheel's spindle and
replaced with an empty one.
When we asked Aunt Arie if she liked to card and spin, she said,
"Ah, yes! I loved it. I'd be up a'settin' an'a'cardin' an'a'spinnin' till
one'r'two o'clock in th'mornin'. They'd holler at me, 'Get in that bed!'
Spinnin' makes a racket. Oh, Lord, I just loved t'spin. Get that thread
up there. Have y'ever seen anybody spin? It's th'prettiest work, ain't
it? Turn that wheel, run that thread up. I always had t'run it on a
shuck. Put a shuck on th'spindle. Oh, I wish I could do that now. I
loved t'do that."
The following pictures and captions show the steps involved in pre-
paring the wool for weaving by carding and spinning it.

The first goal in carding is to prepare a number of "bats,"
for which a set of rough-toothed "breaking cards" is used. Margaret Norton
first loads the top card with raw wool.
PLATE 202 
When the top one is filled with raw wool, Margaret draws it over
the bottom one, using substantial pressure, ten to twelve times (motion A,
Plate 199). Then she gets the wool back onto the top card (motion C) with one
firm stroke, and repeats the combing. By then the wool is usually well broken
and fluffy. If not, she repeats a third time.

============================================================
PAGE 183
============================================================

PLATE 203 
When the wool is sufficiently broken, Margaret then makes the
actual bat by one firm forward stroke (motion B, left) and two light backward
strokes (motion C).

The bat ends up on the top card and is peeled off and set aside.
Usually Margaret makes bats all one day and rolls all the next.

PLATES 205-207 
In making rolls for spinning, Margaret uses a set of fine-
toothed "roll cards." She takes one bat, pulls it apart, distributes it over the top
card {Plate 205) as before, and combs the wool several times (Plates 206—207)
as before (motions A and C).

============================================================
PAGE 185
============================================================

PLATE 208 
When the wool is completely combed and is soft and silky (Plate
207), Margaret begins the actual process of making the rolls. First, with one
smooth stroke of motion C, she transfers all the wool onto the top card. Then,
using motion D, she moves one-third of the wool from the top card onto the
leading edge of the bottom, as seen here. There should be enough wool on the
top card (i.e., in each bat) to make three rolls.
PLATE 210 
. . . Margaret picks
up the roll and places it on the

of motion E, she gently nudges the roll
backwards. This helps to gather the fibers
and consolidate the wool into an actual
«oll." When the roll is at the back of the

or four times to make sure the roll will hold together.

This done, she picks up the finished roll and places it with the
others—ready to be spun into thread.

Spinning
If you are trying to spin, and the band jumps out of the track cut in
the wheel, one of two things can be done. First, check to make sure the
band is in the correct groove of the spindle (it should be on a straight
line between the spindle and wheel's track). Second, tighten the ten-
sion on the band by twisting the wooden screw at the base of the head
post. If neither works, your wheel may well be warped, making it im-
possible to spin.

Dean Beasley shows us how to spin using one of Margarets
rolls. Her corn shuck bobbin (Plate 198) was already in place on the spindle
as she had been spinning (Plate 214). She simply look the end of one roll and
pressed it against the tag end of the roll she had been spinning (Plate 215), and

Keeping the wheel turning, she draws the thread back until it is

PLATE 219 When the thread is about three feet long, Dean drops it, grasps
it again at the spindle's tip, and, turning the wheel, pinches the thread tightly
between her thumbnail and forefinger and runs down the entire three-foot length
once to help smooth out rough spots. Then, holding tension on the thread, she
moves her hand in an arc until it is in a line directly behind the spindle. This
time as she turns the wheel, the thread winds onto the bobbin. She then repeals
the process, twisting the remainder of the roll into thread, adding another roll
to the end of the last, and so on until the bobbin is full.

our area. (For our log cabin research, Harley showed us, with an axe, how to cut
the almost impossibly intricate dovetail notch.) The spinning wheel shown in the
photographs is one of his latest creations—the sort of thing he does best. Years
ago, he and the other craftsmen who made wheels would make the rims for the
wheels out of one, continuous, straight, heavy (1/4" thick) green white oak split.
They would taper each of the ends (as shown in the diagram on p. 202), draw
the split into a circle, attach the ends together with pegs or short nails, and then
set the wheel up in the attic pressed flat in a mold so it wouldn't warp out of
round while curing.
The following photographs show Harley pointing out various features of the
wheel he made for us: wheel, hub, bench and head post of white pine; spokes of
cherry; front leg of white poplar; and back legs of maple. Traditionally, almost
any kind of hardwood was used. Rounds were turned on either foot- or water-
powered lathes. Other pieces were carved or hewn.

MAKING SKEINS
Though some people dyed the wool before spinning it, many went
ahead and spun it in its natural color. When they had enough full
bobbins to make a warp and weave, they then had a choice of either
leaving it in its natural colors of white or brown, and winding it di-
rectly from the bobbins onto spools for making the warp; or they
could make skeins for easy dyeing, by means of the "reeler." For
dyeing, the skeins were simply hung suspended by sticks into the hot
dye and turned and dipped frequently until they were the desired
shade.
PLATE 240 
Shown here is one type of reeler
that is relatively easy to make. It can be put to-
gether either with nails or with wooden pegs.
One-inch holes are drilled through the bench at
a slant, and the ends of the legs are tapered to
the holes with a drawknife. Almost any type of
wood is suitable.

DYEING WITH WILD PLANTS
Back many years ago when store-bought dyes were scarce, often
only the natural shades of wool were used for material. However,
when people did start dyeing wool different colors, usually their only
sources for dyes were plants, which were boiled down in iron pots. To-
day, copper vats serve this purpose although none of our contacts used
them. When the plants were boiled down, the material or thread was
added to be dyed.
People often mixed mordants with the dye to set or fix colors and
keep them from fading. Vinegar and salt were used quite frequently
as mordants when dyeing with plants. Copperas, a green sulfate of
iron, and alum, a white mineral salt, were also successful mordants
for dyeing cloth. Acetic acid was used as a mordant to color red and
potassium bichromate to color yellow. Most of our contacts didn't use
a mordant when dyeing with walnut hulls, however, as the brown pro-
duced by the hulls rarely faded.

To keep the wool from getting full of roots and stems, some of our
contacts boiled the plants to produce the dye, strained the foreign mat-
ter out of the liquid, and then boiled the wool in the dye. Other con-
tacts boiled the plants in a bag together with the wool to prevent them
getting entangled with the wool. Still, many of our contacts boiled
both plants and materials together.
When the cloth is boiled, it should be dyed a shade darker than the
color you want, since the shade will lighten as the wool dries. The
amount (strength) of dye used depends on how dark a shade you
want.
If you're really interested in dyeing with natural plant dyes, try it.
There are plenty of books that explain the detailed procedures for
dyeing with plants. A fascinating book on this is Natural Dyes in the
United States (Rita J. Adrosko, Associate Curator, Division of Tex-
tiles, Museum of History and Technology, Smithsonian Institution
Press, available at $3-25 from Superintendent of Documents, U. S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402). But it's al-
most more fun to experiment and surprise yourself. Minnie Buchanan
described a woman who experimented with different dyes:
"Now there's a woman been aworkin' here a little with me for
th'last month. She worked up t'last Friday just learnin' t'weave. She'd
been studyin' dyein', too. She found a recipe somewhere t'dye with
coffee an'tea leaves. She got her some white wool an'dyed it an'got a
nice gold color. She got it spun right up here an'wove her a mat out of
it last Friday. Then she toP me she'd tried some with dandelion blooms
an' she said it didn't turn out as well as she thought it ought to. She
did get a pale yeller out of it. Then she tried some with clover leaves
an' said she got just a pale pink with it. She set it with vinegar."
From eleven contacts—people like Lula Norton, Blanche Harkins,
Edith Darnell, and Beulah Perry—we were able to amass a collection
of recipes they used for dyeing cloth. Again, however, the real fun is
in experimenting and surprising yourself with the colors you get. Good
luck!

Walnut hulls, roots, and bark were commonly used as a natural

dve to produce shades of brown and black. The hulls were used for
dve when the walnuts fell off the trees in the fall of the year. Darker
shades of brown or even black were obtained by leaving the hulls,
roots, or bark in the boiling water a longer period of time.
Edith Darnell: Use the outside hull of black walnuts. Add hulls
with the material to boiling water. "They're damp an' when they get
wet, that makes th'prettiest brown. Now they might put th'hulls in
some kind of a bag in th'bottom while it boiled. 'Cause I know
Mommy used t'dye quilt linin's an'all with it. I don't guess it'd take
too long. I guess she'd boil'em till th'dyes got in'em."
Mrs. Darnell said you'd need approximately a peck of walnut
hulls to dye a quilt lining. The hulls can only be used once as a dye.
Her mother added salt as a mordant to set the dye, just before the
material got through boiling.
She also said you could dye with the walnut tree roots. First, you
heat the roots and then peel off the bark. Next, add salt or vinegar to
the dye as the mordant. Then boil the roots with the cloth. It colors a
dark brown.
Belle Dryman's mother only dyed with the brown dye from walnut
hulls; otherwise, she used plain white wool or dark wool from the
black sheep. Belle told us people usually used white wool for blankets
and colored wool for clothes. These are the directions she gave for
dyeing: Wash the wool directly from the sheep. Do not card or spin
before dyeing. Fill a large iron pot with a layer of wool (about two
inches in height) and then a layer of walnut hulls. Continue in this
fashion until pot is full. Fill pot with water and boil it until desired
color is reached. No mordant is necessary.
To make a dark brown, Aunt Arie said to use the walnut bark off
the roots as soon as you dig them. Alternate a layer of wool and a
layer of bark to fill up the pot. Then fill the pot with water and boil.
She said a mordant is unnecessary to make the walnut dye set—the
dye will not fade. For a darker brown, add extra bark.
Mary Carpenter's procedure for a brown dye: gather walnut
hulls in the fall when the hull starts drying up. Boil the hulls in an
iron pot; then remove hulls and strain the juice. Add mordant (one
pint of vinegar or one pint of salt) and stir until fully blended. Add
material and let it boil. Lift material out of the water regularly. Rinse
wool out until water is clear.
Lula Norton's method was to boil walnut hulls until mushy. No
mordant is required. Strain the dye and put material in and let it
simmer. The colors are .shades from tan to brown. To color a rose

beige, add madder root (a plant that grows around the mountains).
Minnie Buchanan's variation was to tie two gallons of walnut hulls
in a cloth sack. Put the sack of hulls in an iron pot and add water.
Put wool in and boil an hour. This will dye more than four skeins
a nice brown color.
Another way to acquire a dark brown is to use both walnut hulls
and roots together. Fill a ten-gallon pot half full of chopped walnut
roots and add one gallon of walnut hulls. Add either one teacup of
salt or vinegar as a mordant. Boil. Lift out roots and hulls and put
in the thread. Boil wool in dye for at least an hour. Add more roots
and hulls for a darker brown.
To make a dye between a rust and brown color, Mary Carpenter
told us to trim the bark off a maple tree. Mix copperas with the
bark in an iron pot. Boil this solution and add thread or material.
Take out when it is the right shade; wash and rinse it.
Use witch-hazel (tree) bark for black. Boil it and add material.
For light tan to yellow color, boil broom sage (broomsedge) and
add to material.
ORANGE-YELLOW
Gertrude Keener: Use the gray moss from an oak or apple tree.
Add water to the moss in a kettle and boil for one hour. Use more
moss for a stronger dye. Sift out the foreign matter. Put thread or
material in. Add five cupfuls of salt as a mordant per two gallons
of moss. Color varies from an orange or yellow to a light brown. Mrs.
Keener commented, "It would be nice t'keep yer moss in a bag.
Th'lady that taught me t'do all these dyes had us t'put th'wool right
down in th'moss, all in with th'roots."
Mrs. Keener also told us that wild broomstraw would make an
orange or yellow dye. Fill a ten-gallon pot with broomstraw. Boil
the broomstraw and cloth together. Add salt as a mordant. Broom-
straw colors both wool and cotton.
Margaret Norton: Use dye flower (dye weed)—blooms in late sum-
mer in untended fields. Gather the flowers when in full bloom. Boil
in water from ten to fifteen minutes, long enough to make it a shade
darker than your desired color. Strain it. It makes a yellow color.
Lula Norton also used coreopsis flower (a plant of the same family
as the aster with yellow, red-and-yellow, or reddish flowers shaped
like daisies) for a yellow color. She boiled the blossoms.
She also gave us this information on black bark making a yellow

dye: "Th'outside of black hickory bark was made for yellows. Just
go out and beat it off th'trees. Boil it up and it makes beautiful
yellows." For mordants, alum for one shade of yellow and potassium
bichromate for another. "We put th'bark in flour bags. They hold
quite a bit." By putting the bark in a bag, the solution doesn't
have to be strained before dyeing the material. When asked the length
of time to boil the bark: "There's no way of measuring your time.
The bark has to be boiled until you get the desired color. People used
t'do a lot of things by th'moon. They thought by getting it on a
certain time of the moon, they made more coloring or juice."
Yellow root can be boiled down to make a yellow and then it fades
out to a soft green.
Get hickory bark when the sap is up so it will peel out better.
Boil it down to make beautiful shades of yellow.
Oak bark also makes a yellow. Boil it until you acquire a thick
"ooze" and then add material.
BLUE
Lula Norton: Use indigo root (colors a blue). "I know that when
my grandmother was making her indigo, she had what they called a
'dye pot.' They had to let this indigo set so long. I used a kind of lye
to make my indigo. They used some kind of a 'brand' and mixed it
up and let it ferment several days before they used it. [The brand is
used to make it ferment.]
"I've understood that they had to put it in barrels of water and let
it sit so long and ferment. The settling to the bottom of the barrel
was what they used for the dye [a clay-like substance]. Now I
bought it in the powdered form. I had a chemical to go with a
powder. You don't boil it; you just dip it in the hot dye until you
get the indigo."
Mr. and Mrs. Tom McDowell: Use maple bark. The color is ob-
tained mainly from the inside bark, but both inside and outside bark
are used. Boil it in a kettle. Remove bark from the dye; add copperas
to set the dye and let it boil about a day. This colors a blue.
Blue can also be obtained from galls (insects form these on the
stems of a ragweed plant, or any other plant). Boil the galls and
add material.
RED
Lula Norton: Use madder. Grind the root up into powder and boil

it with material. Colors from shades of rose pink to red are obtained
from madder. "When I was at Berea, Kentucky once, I heard of a girl
who had inherited her grandmother's madder bed."
Gertrude Keener: Use pokeberries (one gallon of berries to a ten-
gallon pot). Boil them and add your material. This colors from a red
to a maroon. Blackberries, grapes, or any other berries will yield
various other shades of red.
Use red clay (one gallon of clay to a ten-gallon pot). Put clay in
a cloth bag and let it boil. Remove clay and add material. Possibly
use a cup of salt as a mordant. Clay colors a deep orangeish-red.
PURPLE
Use pokeberry roots. Chop up the roots and boil them. Add ma-
terial to get a deep purple color.
GREEN
Use green oak leaves. Boil leaves with material for one to one and
one-half hours. Add salt as a mordant.
Mrs. Norton's variation for green is to dye it yellow first. Then
dye cloth with indigo (blue). "Dye the yellow first because the blue
will take th'color out."
SHUTTLES, ETC.
PLATE 245 The SWIFT was not
widely used traditionally, but it does
save work and is common today. The
sliding wooden screw (arrow) clamps
the expandable swift in position in
either its expanded (shown here) or
contracted position. A skein is slipped
over a contracted swift, and then the
swift is expanded.

PLATE 246 Now a spool is mounted on the SPOOLER directly below the
swiss, and thread from the skein fed onto the spool. As the spooler's crank is
turned, the swiss turns also, feeding thread into the spool until it is full, at
which point it is replaced by another. Spools can also be filled from broaches
(filled bobbins off the spinning wheel) if desired. The swiss would not be used
in this case, however.
PLATE 247 
Filled spools can be

PLATE 249 
Dean uses a WARPER
like the one shown here rather than use
the more traditional warper described
later. One revolution of the warper
(bottom peg to top peg) equals three
yards. When Dean weaves a three-yard
piece the width of a stole (230 threads),
she mounts ten spools in the spool rack,
and goes from top pegs to bottom pegs
twenty-three times. As each spool runs
out, she mounts a full spool in its place,
ties the thread ends together, and con-
tinues.
PLATE 250 When the warp is in
place, the weaver loads the bobbins for
the shuttles. Often a BOBBIN WINDER
is used for this, as seen here. Bobbins
can be loaded either directly from a
skein mounted on a swiss, or from un-
dyed thread still on broaches.

snag the threads. The shape was fashioned with a drawing knife and the holes
cut with an auger and coping saw.

THE GERTRUDE KEENER LOOM
The loom shown on these pages was Gertrude Keeners great-
grandmother's loom. Gertrude estimates it to be at least 150 years
old. Recently she took the pieces down from the barn loft so we could
measure them, and then she put it together for us so we could see
how it worked. It was a nostalgic moment, for material she wove on
this loom paid her way through school.
WEAVING
The procedures of setting up a loom and weaving on it are hard
to explain. Rather than delve into the different types of looms and
intricate patterns, this section describes the use of a four-harness
loom using the same colors of thread for the warp and weft, and using
a simple 4-3-2-1 threading for a plain weave. Although a less com-
plicated method of weaving, this is the traditional way it was done
many years ago.
To fully understand how to weave the more difficult patterns (pages
246-55) refer to The Shuttle-Craft Book of American Hand-weaving
(see Book List, page 246). It shows the pattern drafts for these pat-
terns as well as several hundred others.
Photographs for this section were taken by Ray McBride, Chuck
Ferriss, David Young, Gary Warfield, Carlton Young, and Eddie
Moon.
The contacts who contributed information are Marinda Brown,
Kate Hopper, Dean Beasley, and Jule Anderson.

MAKING A WARP
The first thing you have to do is to make a warp. For this you need
your thread and a warper, or warping frame. Marinda Brown made
a warp for us to show us how she does it, and used it to make
striped belts.
Before you can actually make the warp you have to figure out
how long it will be, and how many threads it will have. To deter-
mine the length, add one yard to the number of yards of cloth de-
sired, plus another two inches for every yard desired. The extra yard
makes up for the warp on the loom which can't be used because of
the threading; it can't be drawn through far enough to weave. The
extra two inches per yard compensates for warp taken up as it is
woven—the threads in cloth don't lie perfectly flat. You can also add
a little extra for fringe and/or hems. Bear in mind the longer the
warp, the harder it is to put on the loom.
The number of threads used depends on four things, which in turn
depend on each other—the size of the thread, how tight you want
PLATE 290

============================================================
PAGE 229
============================================================

PLATE 291 
Mrs. Brown puts on a warp. There are several different colors
of thread being used as Mrs. Brown wants a striped warp. Some advance calcu-
lation is required to figure out where the stripes should come and how many
threads wide they should be. They are put into place on the frame in order.
Mrs. Brown: "There is a yard between each one of these pegs. Say you want
to put on ten yards (want a warp ten yards long). You measure off ten yards;
then you start at this end of your frame [point $ i on Plate 296] and tie a
little knot in your thread and wind as far as ten yards will go."
your weave, the number of dents per inch in the reed, and how wide
the cloth is to be. The following directions are based on one thread
per dent in the reed. Count the number of dents per inch in the
reed of your loom. Multiply this number by the desired width in
inches of your cloth, plus two inches. The added two inches compen-
sate for the fact that the weft draws the edges of the warp in, creat-
ing the selvage, and makes the cloth somewhat narrower than the
threaded warp.
Measure off the desired warp length on one thread. Following the
pattern in the diagram (Plate 290), tie one end to peg # 1, and
string following the solid line until you reach the end of the measured
length. Then follow the dotted line in the opposite direction back to
String your warp in this fashion, counting carefully—every "round
trip" from peg # 1 back to peg # 1 equals two warp threads—until
you have the desired number of threads on (Plate 291). If the warper
fills up before you're done, take it off the warper (explained in Plates
292-293) and repeat the process until you have enough threads. When
you are through stringing the warp, tie a string or ribbon loosely
around the cross between pegs #2 and #3. These crosses keep the
warp threads in order, but both would come completely out if you
failed to tie them.
Slip the end of the warp off the last peg used, and make it
into a chain so the threads will not tangle and sets chain(s) aside.
See diagram in Plate 295.

THREADING THE LOOM
A loom can be threaded from the front or from the back. We will
describe how to thread it from the back, using a simple 4-3-2-1 pat-
tern through the heddles in the harnesses. The threading itself is not
done initially with the long warp, but with an equal number of short
threads called thrums, which are tied to the apron of the warp beam.
Cut about a yard long, as many threads as you have in your warp.
Take the desired width of your cloth plus two inches, and center
this width on the apron of the warp beam. Starting at the right
edge of this width (standing at the back of the loom, facing the
front) tie a small group of thrums, say twelve, to the apron. Con-
tinue tying on groups of thrums, spacing them evenly over the
measured width on the apron, until they are all tied on. See diagram
(Plate 296) for a good knot to use.
PLATE 296
Now you are ready to thread, or draw in, the thrums through the
heddles in the harnesses. The harnesses are numbered from one
through four (in a four-harness loom) beginning at the front of the
loom. See harness diagram (Plate 297). The pattern shown is a
simple 4-3-2-1 pattern. One quarter of the warp threads will go
through the heddles in each harness, so we suggest taking out of
each harness all but the number of heddles which are to be used.
The top diagram in Plate 297 shows the order of the harnesses in the
loom. The other diagram is a draft for the 4-3-2-1 pattern. The
horizontal-numbered rows represent the different harnesses, and the
blackened boxes represent threaded heddles.

237
Using your fingers or a long hook, as in Plate 2g8 thread the thrum
farthest to the right through the eye in the first heddle on the right in
harness #4, (the one closest to you). Working toward your left,
thread the second thrum through the first heddle on the right in harness
$ 3 , keeping this thrum to the left of the threaded heddle in harness
$4. Thread the third thrum through the first heddle on the right in
harness #2, keeping it to the left of the other threaded heddles.
Thread the fourth thrum through the first heddle on the right in har-
ness # 1, again keeping it to the left of the threaded heddles. String
the fifth thrum through the second heddle to the right in harness #4,
beginning the pattern over—continue until you have threaded all the
thrums. It is a good idea to keep checking your threading as you go
along, to make sure it is correct. It is hard to correct later. Pull all the
thrums as far as they will go toward the front of the loom.
SLEYING
Center on the reed the desired width of your cloth plus two inches.
Sitting at the front of your loom, using the hook again, take the first
thrum on your left, and draw it through the leftmost dent to be used
in the reed. Continue pulling all the thrums through the dents, one at a
time, one in each dent, in the order threaded from the left to the
right. You may do this from right to left; it's a matter of preference.
It is important that this is done correctly, or your warp will look
uneven in the woven cloth. Once they are all pulled through the reed,
pull the thrums toward the front of the loom so they will not slip back.
Now you are ready to tie your warp to the thrums. First push the
beater all the way forward, away from you. Without unchaining your
warp, cut the loops which were strung around peg # 1, just above
the two tied crosses—don't let the ties slip out (Plate 300). Sit or
stand at the front of the loom. Keeping your warp ends in order—this
is very important—tie the first warp thread on the left to the first
thrum on the left (Plate 301). Do the same with the second warp
thread and second thrum, and continue working toward the right un-
til the whole warp is tied onto the thrums. You may also work from
right to left, as it is a matter of preference. If you have more than one
warp chain, handle it (them) in the same manner as the first one.
Make sure all your warp threads and thrums are in the right order.
The knots should be as small as possible, with short waste ends of
equal length for each knot.

PLATE 302 
When the warp threads
are all tied to the thrums, the "beam-

be pulled through the reed and the
heddles.
BEAMING
Now you are ready to roll the warp on, a procedure also called
beaming. It will go through the reed and the heddles, and roll around
the warp beam {Plate 302). You will need another person to roll the
warp beam, plus several slim, smooth sticks longer than the width of
the warp. Carefully untie the ribbons around the crosses on the warp
chain. Standing at the front of the loom with the other person at the
back, unchain a couple of feet of the warp. Holding it taut straight
back from the loom, have the warp beam rolled slowly, and give gently
as it is rolled on. Be very careful as the knots go through the reed and
heddles. Stop the rolling and unchain more warp; have it rolled on
again. One or two sticks should be placed lengthwise between the beam
and the warp being rolled on, for every revolution of the beam (Plate
305)- (The sticks keep the warp from tangling on the beam, and keep
the strands on the edge from rolling on tighter than the rest.) Con-
tinue in this way until the end of the warp is about even with the
breast beam.
Unroll the cloth beam and bring the apron over the breast beam.
Center a width on the cloth beam apron a little wider than the width
centered on the reed. Cut the loops at this end of the warp. Beginning
at the left, tie the warp onto the apron (Plate 303) in small groups of
threads (as you tied the thrums onto the warp beam apron, using the
same knot). Spread the groups of threads out so they are evenly-
spaced on the centered width on the apron. Make sure all the threads
are in the right order, as they were threaded, and keep them evenly
taut (Plate 304). You may begin tying from the other side or from the
center, if that is easier.

WEAVING
You are almost ready to weave. Roll the cloth beam back so the
end of the apron is just over the breast beam, and roll the warp
beam until the whole warp is taut. Fill your shuttles with thread for
your weft. You must first throw five or ten shots for a header, or
heading, which will even out the warp and bring it to proper width.
Weaving involves three fairly easy motions—throwing the shuttle
(Plate 307), treadling, and pulling back the beater, or batten. We'll
give you the treadling pattern which will make a plain weave with the
given threading. The treadles are numbered one to four, from the left
to the right on a four-harness loom (see Plate 281). The treadles are
tied to the harnesses; the treadling pattern plus the threading pattern
determine the type of weave.
Your treadling pattern is one and three, two and four, one and three,
two and four, etc. Push down treadles #1 and #3. Hold one end of
the thread in the shuttle at one side of the warp; with the other hand
throw the shuttle through the opening between the two layers of warp.
Do not pull the weft too tight. Pull the beater back gently (push it for-
ward to its original position each time you use it), change to treadles
#2 and #4, which in turn changes your shed. Use the beater again,
and throw your shuttle through the other way. Use the beater, change
to treadles #1 and #3, use the beater, throw the shuttle the other
way. Continue this pattern, using treadle, beater, shuttle, beater,
treadle, etc. until the header is even and smooth. Once you have an
inch or two woven, you may use the beater with greater force.
You're finally ready to weave whatever you like. Weave an inch
or so for a hem, or leave a space for fringe. Continue weaving as you
would the header; you'll notice that as you weave, the cloth takes up
your shuttling space. Release the warp beam, as much as necessary,
lock it again, and roll the cloth beam as far back as you can and still
weave. Make sure the warp is taut before you go on weaving.
When you leave your loom for any time, always loosen the warp beam
so the warp won't weaken and stretch. When your cloth reaches the
desired length, weave another inch or so for a hem and weave another
header, or skip a place for fringe, then weave a header.
To remove the cloth, loosen the warp beam, push the beater for-
ward, pull the cloth toward the breast beam, and cut the cloth just
above the header. Make sure the rest of the warp does not slip through
the reed. Completely unroll the cloth beam, and cut just below the
first header. Tie your loose warp ends (now thrums!) so they will
not slip through the reed. (You can tie another warp to these thrums

============================================================

and start all over.) Finish off your cloth by cutting off the header
and hemming, or tying the fringe so the cloth won't ravel. Finished
material is usually washed, then stretched, while wet, on a frame to dry
(Plate 309). The dots represent nails on which the material is speared
while drying.

Many say you
can instantly tell how good a
weaver is by looking at the
edges of the finished cloth. A
careless weaver will invariably
produce sloppy, ragged edges.
Dean produces flawless edges
by first throwing the shuttle
through the warp, then putting
the shuttle down and pulling
the remainder of the "shot"
gently through the warp by
hand and checking to make
sure the tension is exactly right
so that each shot neither pulls
too hard on the warp threads,
nor leaves a loop dangling out
from the edge; and only then
pulling the beater back.

GLOSSARY
Aprons—the strips of heavy canvas attached to the cloth beam and
the warp beam. The loose flap of the apron holds the metal rod to
which the warp threads are attached. See diagram in Plate 310.
Beam (verb)—to roll a warp onto the warp beam; pulling it from
the front of the loom through the reed and heddles, around the warp
beam, by means of turning the warp beam.
Beater (or batten)—a swinging frame set crosswise of the loom. It car-
ries the "reed" or "sley." The beater, falling forward against the edge
of the web, delivers most of the beat by its own weight. As each new
weft thread is thrown, the beater is pulled back to press it into place.
Breast beam—from beam of loom over which the material passes.
Chain—the warp is made into a chain as it is taken off the warping
frame. See chain diagram (Plate 295).
Choker—tie thread about one-half yard from the cross. It keeps thread
same tension while tying on to tabby thread or drawing in.
Cloth beam—the beam onto which the finished cloth is rolled.
Cloth beam apron—see Aprons.
Cross—formed where warp ends cross in alternate succession around
pegs on a warper. Its purpose is to keep the threads straight.
Dent—the space between the vertical bars of the reed. The threads
pass through these spaces.
Draw-in—see Thread.
Draft—a drawn pattern which shows how to thread a loom in a
particular way. Each different threading can be depicted by a draft.
Filler—see Weft.
Harness—the shedding mechanism consists of two or more harnesses
(or heddle frames) carrying "heddles," operated to rise and sink
by means of foot treadles or hand levers.
Header—one inch of scrap weft to begin piece of material.
Heddles—the wires or strings mounted in the harnesses. Each heddle
has one eye in its center through which a thread passes.
Loom—machine for weaving cloth.
Reed—a comb (the teeth of which are made of metal, reed, or bamboo)
which is mounted in the beater and serves to space the warp threads.
Selvage—the very edges of woven cloth, where the warp threads are
drawn closer together than in the rest of the cloth.

============================================================

FROM RAISING SHEEP TO WEAVING CLOTH 
245
Shed—the pattern of the warp threads in the opening made between
the two layers of warp, made when part of the treadles are pushed
down. The shuttle is then passed through this opening.
Shot—the action of throwing the shuttle between the two layers of
warp thread created by using the treadles.
Shuttle—carries thread from one side of the web to the other.
Sley—to draw the thrums or warp through the dents in the reed.
Tabby—the threads left on loom to tie the new warp to.
Thread (draw-in)—to bring the thrums, or warp, through the
heddles in a certain pattern.
Thrums—short threads around a yard long which are tied to the
apron of the warp beam, and used to thread the loom. They are
much easier to thread than the warp itself would be.
Treadle (verb)—to manipulate the heddles of the loom.
Treadle (noun)—foot pedals under loom which cause the harnesses
to go up and down.
Warp—the threads running parallel to the sides of the loom, and
crossed by the weft. The warp is rolled onto the warp beam, threaded
through the heddles and reed, and tied onto the apron of the cloth
beam.
Warp apron—see Aprons.
Warp beam—the beam around which the unwoven warp is wound.
Warper—a square or rectangular frame with pegs on it arranged in
a regular pattern, or similarly arranged pegs fitted into a wall. A
warper is used to measure off a warp to thread onto a loom. When
used correctly, all the threads stay in the same order they are put on
the warper.
Weft—the threads which are woven across the warp, perpendicular to
the sides of the loom. The weft (or woof) spins off a bobbin in the
shuttle as one weaves. The weft is also called the filler.

T'ME, WEAVIN'S LIKE LIFE
In trying to learn about the actual process of weaving, we were
especially interested in the personal feelings of the weaver.
As we began talking to these people, we found that weaving was
more than just a job or a way to make a living. It took away the
loneliness of an endless day. We realized this when Mrs. Darnell
said, "When no one's aroun', you can be a hummin' an' a singin'
while you're sitting there weavin' that pattern."
Weaving also proved to be a challenge when Mrs. Brown asked us,
"Have any of you ever taken music? Well, you see a piece o' music
an' you want t'sit down an' try it out an' see what it's like. Well,
I'm that way with my weavin'. If I see a pattern draft, I wanna sit
down an' try it out."
After talking to Gertrude Keener, we found that weaving is some-
thing very special and meaningful to her. "When you watch your
pattern grow, t'me it's like life—more like living. It's more like build-
ing character than anything else I can describe it with. It's like teachin'
a child from th'beginning to grow. As your pattern grows 'r as your
cloth grows, it's just like a child growin' up. You weave your life into
somethin' beautiful. That's the way I see it."
We realized the deep meaning and love they had for their work.
The women we talked to have something rare and valuable to carry
with them throughout life—stories to tell, a deeper insight into people,
more patience and endurance, and, most important of all, the knowl-
edge to pass down an art that is dying.

Mrs. Harry Brown is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating weav-
ers we interviewed. She is constantly at work weaving rugs, belts,
mats, stoles, ponchos, pocket books, and other pieces of beautifully-
done work. She is an expert in accuracy and skill with her craft. She
always weaves for more people than she has time for, but still manages
to do it with a smiling face and happy attitude.

Mrs. Brown's history -of her career in weaving is a long but in-
teresting one. "Harry's mother, 'Mother Brown,' taught me t'weave. I
helped her thread up th'loom. She made some coverlets for all of
her children. I went with her down to Mrs. Zac Dillard's, Barnard
Dillard's parents. She had a warping frame. Oh, it wus a great big
thing. She kept it outside an' it went just about all th'way across
th'house. Mother Brown put on about a hundred yards of warp.
An' I helped her carry that thread back an' forth. It seemed like we
walked miles an' miles in getting it on. That's how older people
that lived a long time back warped their thread. It wus a lot
stronger than thread we get hold of today that we weave with. It
has made me wonder in working with th'fine threads that I do, how
they ever managed t'get it on. That's th'hardest part about it.
"I do remember helping her thread up th'loom. Sometime after
she made these coverlets, she brought her loom here an' put it on
our porch that went all th'way aroun' th'house. An' she let me set
th'loom up on th'porch an' she did some weaving on th'porch. Then
she let me keep th'loom an' weave rugs. I made quite a few rugs with
worn clothing that I worked up th'strings myself.
"Mother Brown died in 'thirty-nine. She had parts o' that loom
borrowed from people all over th'community. When she died, we
returned those parts an' there wadn't anything left much. We took
th'loom down an' set it out an' o' course it just went t'bad.

"Then I didn't do anything but weave rugs fer 'bout four 'r five
years after I got my own loom. After they started th'rug plant I got
lots o' their waste yarns. I salvaged them from th'dump people.
I'd find boxes of yarn in some of our gullies. So after I got hold o'
that I just branched out an' started doing other things.
"I think about th'first thing I did after I made rugs, I wove a stole.
I had taken about a week's course at Gatlinburg an' this lady
showed us how t'make stoles. She had a draft that she had made up
herself that gave th'steps in it. I debated on that fer a good many
weeks before I ever undertook it. Finally I did get around an' I or-
dered th'thread that she recommended t'use. An' I went t'work
on th'stoles an' it wasn't hard to do.
"We had four small gran'daughters, an' I made them each a skirt.
They had made skirts over at Calmia when I got my loom. An' I
just thought they were so pretty. They'd make th'plain weave an'
then they'd put bands aroun' th'bottom. I got my idea from them an'
then I worked out my colors an' my designs an' made those girls a
skirt each. I did that after I did my stole an' found out I could work
th'finer threads.
"It took me quite a long time t'learn how t'thread it up an' change
my different pattern drafts. Then finally they had a book over at
th'Craft Shop that I borrowed and later bought myself. From that
I just worked an' learned to do a lot o' different patterns, but for a
long time I just practiced.
"Have any of you ever taken music? Well, you see a piece o' music
an' you want t'sit down an' try it out and an' see what it's like. Well,
I'm that way with my weavin'. If I see a pattern draft, I wanna sit
down an' try it out."
After seeing all the many different kinds of things Mrs. Brown had
woven, we were curious as to what was the most difficult for her to
do. She said, "I guess maybe 'bout th'hardest work t'do is t'make
ponchos and stoles with wool thread—it's fine thread an' sometimes
you get a hold of some of it that isn't very strong. Sometimes I don't
get m'warp on as good as I'd like. It took me a long time t'learn how
t weave with wool. I've made some pieces that I've had t'just tear
up completely."
Mrs. Brown has enjoyed weaving a little bit of everything. She felt
proudest after she had woven a coverlet because it was such a difficult
project to undertake. "The first coverlet I did I got ahold o'some
thread at th'plant that worked up real pretty. My husband had
made two of th'gran'daughters a three-quartered size bed out of

============================================================
PAGE 246
============================================================

250 
FOXFIRE 2
some walnut trees he had taken off th'place. He made those beds an'
after he got them fixed up, I thought, 'Now how nice it'd be t'make
a coverlet for each one.' So I threaded it up t'that whig rose pattern
because it's somethin' I wanted t'work out an' it's my favorite
pattern. It really worked out right pretty. I made it so I could put
three panels together if I wanted to. One o' th'panels I got my design
all messed up an' I didn't have enough thread t'go back an' do it over
an' make another one like it. So I fixed up one that they could use on
th'bed an' then th'other one I fixed so they could use it on th'couch.
They were done in light blue an' white and it worked out all right.
That showed me that I could do it. So I had quite a bit of practice
when I got ready to do a good one."
Weaving was Mrs. Brown's answer for something to occupy her
time. She never had to weave for money, but in the past year or two
she has sold almost all of her work. Her story explains this: "I didn't
expect t'make anything off of it. I would work in th'community and
I worked in th'church and in Sunday School for a long period of
time. Then after our boys left home my husband wus busy all th'time
an' he didn't have time t'take me here an' there. I never did learn how
t'drive, so I depended on our boys t'take me where I had t'go. After
they left home I realized, 'Well, I don't have anything t'do.'
"I walked many a time to th'school house to a club meeting'r a
missionary meeting, but later I found that I couldn't walk like I used
to an' I ended up staying at home all the time.
"I tried knittin' an' I tried embroiderin', but m'eyes were troublin'
me when I did close work like that. So I just kept looking aroun' for
something t'do. When I took my rags over to Calmia, I started weavin'
rugs. It wus just really fascinating how you could take your colors
an' blend them in.
"One day while I was weavin' some customer came in an' wanted
t'know if they had any rag rugs for sale. Mrs. Hopper tol' 'em, 'No,
we don't do very much o' that.' I had an idea right there—why don't
I let that be my hobby?
"I talked with Mrs. Van Gorder about it. She wus another inspira-
tion. She wus th'music teacher at th'time in th'school. She had a loom
in her cottage that she worked on at night. Our son took music and
in order t'keep him interested, I took music awhile. I would take a
lesson when he would take a lesson an' she would have her loom set
up an' things that she'd done on it. I just raved over it—I thought
it wus so pretty. I just kept gettin' an inspiration every time I'd see
a piece of woven work. She encouraged me t'go ahead an' buy a loom.
She advised me for a long time not t'do anything but rugs.

"An' I managed in some way t'dispose of m'rugs. Some I would
mve away an' some I would just sell for almost nothin'. After a while
I rot started where I could sell enough t'buy my thread an' my ma-
terials. I wove out o' things that were given to me at first so I could
afford t'give'em away if I wanted to. I gave away just about till I
supplied ever'body with somethin' that I had done.
"Soon I got t'sellin' a little here an' a little there. An' I got ad-
vertised by word of mouth. Somebody would see something placed
in a home an' they'd come get an order in. There were lots o' friends
that were interested in what I wus doin'. It just kind of grew.
"Then th'fellow that writes these articles for the Constitution
came an' interviewed us both [Harry and Marinda]. We call this
our 'old age hobby.' He gave us a writeup in th'Constitution an'
that just swamped us. About that same time Suzy came along an'
she helped us a whole lot with the Craft Organization that we had
in th'county. An' just by degrees we kind of worked up. Now we have
t'work hard t'supply th'demand."
Mrs. Brown's craft has brought her some close friends who share
her interest. "It's unbelievable how many people you meet. Take for
instance in our harvest sales, people will come along an' see that you've
done weavin' an' they'll strike up a conversation with you an' tell you
that they are interested in that an' they have done some. Then they tell
you so many interesting things—the people traveling like that to for-
eign countries that know a lot about weavin' an' what th'people have
done. It surprises you how many people are interested in that kind
o' work. I thought when I started this business that this had just about
died down. I never had th'opportunity t'meet people that were inter-
ested in that type of work.
"An' we've had quite a bit of correspondence with people since this
article came out in th'Constitution. People'd write an' say, 'My
mother'r my grandmother used t'weave so an' so, can you do that?'
There were lots o' interesting letters."
Weaving seems to be on a give-and-take basis for Mrs. Brown. "It
takes a lot of patience. Things that I would start t'do I'd want t'do too
quick an' not turn out a good job. Now I take my time in weavin'. It
just don't pay t'weave a piece o' material an' throw it away, I found
out. Weavin's just so satisfying. If you're interested in what you're do-
>ng, you can just sit down an' ferget everything. I've woven when I
wus disturbed. Last week I didn't feel too good. I wus tired but I wus
doing something that I wanted t'get done. I kept right at it when I
really didn't feel like it an' m'mind wouldn't stay on it. I'd have t'go
back an' take some out. I'd put in some that didn't do right. I no-

ticed yer feelings have something t'do with it. Like th'way y'work yer
beater. Sometimes you give it a harder jerk than y'do other times. An'
it makes your weaving a little closer together. It'll tell on you all
th'way through."
Mrs. Brown has changed considerably since she started weaving.
Her entire personality has been opened up. She proved this by saying:
"It's just broadened my vision of living all together. I feel like I have
more t'talk about. Sometimes I'm afraid I bore people by talking
about my craft, but I'm still interested in any kind of craft that other
people do. That has broadened my sense of other people's interests. I
used t'be real shy before I started weavin'."
Living on Betty's Creek is an excellent weaver and delightful person
named Edith Darnell. Her loom sits in the family room of her home
where it is put to use a great deal of her time. Other than weaving a
little for each of her eight daughters, she manages to weave for almost
anyone who likes her work. She was first introduced to weaving about

twelve years ago: "The Jay Hambidge Art Foundation didn't have no-
body one day t'help weave. I wus on a double loom, me an' another'n.
I never had wove any. I had t'take one side an' keep up with n'other
girl. I wus weavin' an' I missed them pedals an' skinned my ankles.
That's where I started my weavin'. I done pretty well, though.
"I worked for Mrs. Hambidge only a little while. I liked workin'
there but I didn't like workin' th'wool threads an' no cotton.
"Soon I went over t'Mrs. Norton's, over in North Carolina, an' I
learned how t'make th'dogwood flowers an' weave them. Then I got
my loom an' did my own.
"I never had no trouble weavin' an' fixin' out patterns. I can weave
'bout anything that's down on paper. I like th'pattern weavin' better'n
any. I love th'pattern weavin'. I just like t'see 'em come out. When
that pattern comes out right y'feel good."
The cat paw is Mrs. Darnell's favorite pattern to weave and she en-
joys making bedspreads the most. "Before our house burnt, I had
seven bedspreads t'get burnt up! I hain't done too many since. I sold
three I reckon."
There was one particular piece of material she wove and became
very attached to. With a proud look on her face, Mrs. Darnell said, "I
weaved it fer somebody else." In her bedroom, though, sits a framed
picture of that bedspread she cherishes and loves so much.
You would think that after weaving all these years, Mrs. Darnell
would have done some work for herself. This is untrue in her case. She
said, "Everything I've done someone else wanted it and I'd just sell it,
but I'm gonna weave me somethin'. I'm makin' me a little house, a
place where I can keep all my stuff to itself. My house is crowded so."
Mrs. Darnell expressed the importance of having patience to weave
when she said, "I've always been patient in workin' weavin'. I've al-
ways had lots o' patience with m'work. Even th'loom threadin'—I've
never had anyone t'show me how t'thread a loom. I just did it by
th'pattern myself. Threadin' th'loom an' puttin' th'warp on is
th'hardest. It takes lots o' time t'put in a warp. When y'get that
through, yer done. I don't mind t'do it, though. It just takes a little
longer. I learned t'put m'warps on myself. I can roll one plumb across
about fifty yards—all by myself, comb it an' all, and hold it an' roll
it."
The time-consuming and hard work put in to weaving seems to be
nothing compared to all of the joy Mrs. Darnell gets out of it. "I'd
still weave even if I didn't sell anything. I'd rather weave as eat. When

no one's aroun', you can be a weavin' your pattern an' a hummin' an'
a singin' while you're sittin' there.
"When you're troubled y'go t'weavin'. Y'can just set an' be happy
when yer weavin'—'r I can. I don't know whether ever'body can.
Anything like weavin'r quiltin', I'm just as well concerned as I can
be."
Gertrude Keener is a very remarkable person. She is rather quiet,
but she always has a smile on her face. After visiting her, we were truly
amazed at all the beautiful work she has turned out. She has been
weaving since the age of ten. We were amused by her story of how she
learned to weave: "I learned myself off my momma's spinning wheel.
She didn't want us messing up her spinning, and I remember very well
one day she wus cookin' dinner and I went to th'spinning wheel an'
started spinning. And I didn't draw my thread out quite long enough
an' quite thin enough an' I had a great big lump on my thread. An' I

rolled it up an' Mommy came back an' undone it an' redid it. But
that's how I got interested in it. Then Mommy taught me weaving."
Mrs. Keener seems to think bedspreads are the nicest things to
weave. "I like th'whig rose pattern an' th'pine pattern—they're both
very pretty patterns. For rugs, th'dog track pattern an' for placemats
I think th'log cabin is th'prettiest an' th'goose-eye pattern is a nice pat-
tern t'weave materials with like coats. These are all real old patterns."
In her early days, Mrs. Keener had to weave to enable her to get an
education. "After my first year in high school I went t'Camp Dixie as
an assistant to a craft's teacher. An' that's where I helped th'children
weave. But then during th'rest of my time at home I wove coverlets
for money an' made my own money fer high school an' I made my
money fer college—weaving during th'summer months an' weaving
during my spare time. Y'see, I would take orders at Camp Dixie. Peo-
ple would give me orders an' that would be all I could do t'fill those
orders. I'd always fill my orders an' have money enough fer school."
Weaving was an inspiration to Mrs. Keener, as well as to those she
taught. "Weaving may have helped me t'be more patient. It gives me a
feeling of accomplishment. An' when I taught the children at Camp
Dixie, I found that wus one o' th'best things to help them to enjoy it.
A lot of 'em would be homesick. But if I could ever get one of 'em
started workin' on somethin' like that, their homesickness would fade
away. An' that taught them t'be more patient. Weaving is really good
for you. You have t'have patience t'weave and I've been quoted as
havin' a lot of patience. I don't think anybody would be successful
with weaving if they didn't have any patience."
Weaving seemed to be something very special and relative to Mrs.
Keener's personality. Quoting her feelings seems to be the only ap-
propriate way to end our talk with her. "I've always been real inter-
ested in weaving an' I think it's one of the greatest crafts ever an' I
just love makin' a pattern an' weaving different things. I think it's an
art that we need t'keep. That's th'reason I want t'get started back.
And my daughter wants me t'teach her t'weave all these different de-
signs. She said she wanted me t'do all that while I wus able—before
I got too old t'do that kind of work. I love t'weave. I think it's th'most
relaxin' thing you can do. When you watch your pattern grow, t'me
its like life, more like living. It's more like building character than
anything else I can describe it with. It's like teachin' a child from
th'beginnin' to grow—as your pattern grows'r as your cloth grows,
it's just like a child growin' up. You weave your life into somethin'
beautiful. That's the way I see it."

h'place of th'washin' is
by a branch. That's
where most ever'body
washes. Now, my great uncle lived up away from a branch, and they
built what they call a wood pump. In other words, they took little
logs and they took an auger and bored a hole all th'way through that,
and then they joined"em together. And they made a line for th'water
t'come down to th'house from th'branch."
Even as he said this, Mr. Dickerson led us over to the pile of wood
he planned to use.
"And some of'em that maybe couldn't do that, they'd dig'em a
trench around th'side of th'hill and run th'water around out there.
There's one feller up here in Wolfork, he built his house out where he
could see over th'valley. Well, he didn't have any water there, and it
was rock and he couldn't dig a well, so he went up about a thousand
feet to a branch and he made him a wooden trough from that branch
around th'mountain down there to his house.
"These spouts we'uz talkin' about—they's two'r'three ways t'make-
'em. But when th'first settlers moved in here, they didn't have any
lumber—couldn't get any—so they'd take a pole like this and they'd
cut'em a V trough down th'pole, and they'd build a dam out in
th'branch and let th'water come down this V pole and pour out.
"And then another way they would do it: when th'sap was high,
and we had plenty of chestnut trees, you'd get a chestnut tree, take
your axe and split th'bark, and then you'd start spreadin' that bark
off. Peel it off th'whole pole and lay it out and let it dry and they'd use

that bark there for a trough. Takes a pretty big tree. When it comes off
th'tree, it's pliable. You can bend it. So they'd just bend it and take a
piece a'bark or maybe a bit of hickory withe and tie it up and lay it
out in th'sunshine. It'ud fold up and dry and stay that way.
Y'see, water is runnin' in it all th'time, and that keeps it from air
crackin'. We had a spout at home, and ever' night when we'd been
goin' barefoot we'd go out there and wash our feet.
That wooden trough, they dig it out of chestnut because it's easy
t' work and th'grain's straight. I've seen some old troughs made that
way that'd last maybe twenty-five years.

Mr. Dickerson notches the ends of the three legs to fit the
battling bench, and then nails them into place. The bench has three legs so
that it will set steady, even on rough ground.

"You can take timber and keep it in water. I bought a place over
here in th'Depression and I had to recover some ditches. And they'd
put some sycamore poles down 'fore I got it. I pulled out one sycamore
pole that was just as green as that apple tree. It'd been down there in
that water 'bout twenty-five years. But you cut one down and lay it
out. In a year, it's just all to pieces."'
Bv then he had a large oak log that he had split in half lengthwise
to make the top of the battling bench. The flat surface formed a coun-
ter approximately twelve inches wide and four and a half feet long. It
was left rough.
"Y'want it kind'a rough, y'see? When you're battlin', it'll knock
th'dirt out in th'cracks. If it's perfectly smooth on top, you'll beat
th'dirt back in your clothes."
He then took three pine poles about five inches in diameter and
thirty-two inches long. Notching one end of each, he nailed them into
place as legs for the bench as shown in the photographs.
"Y'make three legs to th'bench because three legs'll set steady on
any kind'a ground. Sometimes th'wind's blowin' smoke over in your
face and y'want'a move your things around. Y'move it and y'don't
have t'level up your bench. It just sets there.
"And your bench goes out from your tub so y'can work from either
side. The single leg won't be in th'way. It's not a'stickin' out."
Both the paddle and the battling stick are made of pine. Though
their lengths are different (one is about four feet long and the other
one foot), their shapes are basically the same. The end of the longer
paddle, however, is tapered and rounded "t'fit with th'bottom of your
pot so y'can scoop ever'thing up."
Also, "Y'want th'handles flat so they won't turn in your hand. That
paddle might turn over in your hand and spill your clothes.
"With your battling stick [the short one], y'don't want square cor-
ners. Y'round them off because when y'hit with a square corner,
y'might injure your clothes."
Mr. Dickerson then made the paddles that we would use that after-
noon. Both were of pine, as it is light, soft, and easy to work.
First he shaped the handles using his hatchet, and then he smoothed
up the handles and paddle blades with a drawing knife. "When you're
cuttin' a straight line like this [the handle], you use your drawin' knife
like this [with the beveled edge of the blade up]. When you're comin'
into a curve, you turn your drawin' knife over. See, this edge is bev-
eled. If it was straight, you'd dig in."

PLATES 323-324 
Here he works on the two
paddles that are needed. In Plate 323, with a
drawknife, he shapes in the handle for the stir-
ring paddle. In Plate 324, he hews out the
handle for the battling stick. The handle will
be smoothed as in Plate 323. The blade of stir-
ring paddle will be tapered and shaped to fit
the bottom of the pot.

While he worked with the drawing knife, the paddle was clamped
in a vise. A shaving horse could also have been used, though.
Additional smoothing was accomplished with the edge of a small
piece of glass.
Then, using a large black iron pot and two pairs of bluejeans, we
began the actual washing.
"Well, let's get our water started then. Get our bucket and we'll
put some water in there and we'll build a fire. That water'ud run all
th'time at th'old-fashioned wash places. People usually kept a bucket
settin' under there so if y'happened to want some water right quick,
you'd always have a bucket full when y'went t'th'spout.
"Now, y'have t'put a little water in [the iron pot] before y'start
th'fire so th'heat won't crack it. Here th'wind's kindly wrong, but I
guess we can make it, maybe. Y'need t'stack your wood under your
tub kindly, and y'have t'keep it a'goin' all th'time. If you'll put some
a'those chips up in under there, she'll come."
PLATE 325 
Now Mr. Dickerson
pours a bucket of water into the pot
before lighting the fire so that as the
pot gets heated, it won't crack. Then
he lights the fire.

PLATES 326-327 
As the water heats, Mimi Dickerson alternates rinsing and
battling until most of the heavy dirt is dissolved out of the clothes.
Mimi Dickerson, carrying out the process from there, began to fill
the pot with water as the fire caught. While she was waiting for the
water to boil, she took the clothes and rinsed them out in cold water at
the end of the battling bench. Then she took each piece separately,
lifted it sopping wet onto the bench, and battled it with the short pad-
dle, turning it over and over continuously as she worked. Then each
piece was rinsed, battled again, and then rinsed again. Had there been
any heavy stains, they would have been scrubbed out.
When the water was boiling, soap was added and the battled clothes
were put in to boil.
"It helps to keep'em stirred so th'soap can go through'em and get
th'dirt out of em. Workin'em down with th'paddle helps it come out
better. Now we just rench'em and hang'em out."
The clothes were then lifted, steaming, out of the pot and carried
over to the tub at the end of the battling bench, which had been re-
filled with fresh, cold water. After being rinsed there, they were carried
over to the second tub, under the spout, and rinsed well a second time.
Then they were shaken out well and hung up to dry while still com-
pletely wet.

PLATE 328 
Having battled much of the dirt out of the clothes, and having
removed any stains that might "set" in the hot water, Mimi boils the clothes for
about twenty minutes in soapy water. She keeps them stirred as they boil so that
the soap can work its way into every crease.
PLATES 329-330 
Now the boiled clothes are run through three rinses to
make sure they are clean. The rinsing is done in two separate tubs: one at the
end of the battling bench, and one under the water trough. In the old days,
these tubs would be made by cutting a wooden barrel in half through the middle.

The clean clothes are then hung out to dry.

When the job is done, Mr. Dickerson inserts the ends of two
sticks through the eyes of the pot in order to turn it over without burning him-
self.

Water is then poured over the bottom of the pot to rinse off any
ashes and soot that might have accumulated there during the washing operation.

"We used t'rench our clothes three times, and then hang'em out
wet.
"Y'usually turn'em after y'rench'em so th'inside of'em can dry bet-
ter. It's better t'hang'em out a'fore they start dryin' 'cause they won't
be so wrinkled and they're softer."
On each side of the pot is an eye. Two poles are run through these
to empty the water out of the pot without getting burned.
"Th'pot has little eyes on th'side. Th'reason for those eyes: y'can set
th'pot off and on your fire. When y'go t'set it down, you're out here
where y'can see when you're hittin' your rocks. When y'get through
your washin', turn your water out. Then turn your pot upside down
on these pillars here t'keep your pot clean. It won't rust then, and
y'don't have t'scrub it out ever'time y'wash.
"It's a job washin' for a whole family. All your bed clothes, all your
towels, and if ylive on th'farm y'have extra overhauls, shirts. If
th'weather's fit, you wash once a week. Y'try t'pick a day when it's not
rainin'r'somethin', but if there's snow on th'ground, y'just have t'go on
and do it anyway. I'll tell y'what I did: bought me a boiler and put it
on my kitchen stove and boiled mine in there.
"I have washed about all day. Used to wash till dinner time and go
fix dinner and then come back and finish washin'. It didn't take too
long t'wash a load. We'd boil th'clothes say maybe thirty minutes'r'so,
and sometimes not quite that long dependin' on how much dirt they
was in'em. But y'see, you rubbed'em some before you put'em in th'pot,
and got th'worst out. Now if you'uz gonna boil a pair of real dirty
overhauls, you'd have t'boil'em a little longer than you'd boil a sheet.
"We had flat irons then. We'd set'em down in front a'th'fireplace,
or on th'stove, and heat'em and then iron. They'd weigh about five
pounds—six pounds—and some seven. You could iron five'r'six pillow
cases—maybe a little more'n that—and then you'd have t'heat your
iron again. Y'kept one heatin' all th'time though.
"Now that's th'whole bit!"

ANNA HOWARD
nna 
Howard 
is 
ninety-
three years old. She was
born in Franklin, North
Carolina, and still lives less than ten miles from there.
When I first saw her, sitting by her little wood heater, I knew I
wouldn't forget her. Anna is the type of person that is the same every
time you see her. She had been sick and in the hospital for over a year.
I guess one reason why I love Anna so is that despite her illness, she
has a tremendous ambition to go on and work. For over a year she
was unable to walk, and yet she went on and cooked and kept house
and even made her garden, getting around in a homemade wheelchair
(a little straight-backed chair without arms that had four small wheels
from a child's wagon mounted on the legs). A person who, among
other things, would go on and work when she couldn't even walk is
special to me.
Like our other contacts, Anna grew up in a self-sufficient age. Her
father raised both wheat and flour which he had ground into meal.
She tended their chickens and stock, often spending long periods of
time in the woods rounding up their cattle. Even as a young girl, she
churned butter, helped can food in large, homemade churn jars, and
entertained herself by making rag dolls, tiny flower pots, and play
houses with little rock chimneys. And she used to ride the dirt road to
town on a black mare, once getting so bogged down in the muck that
some neighbors had to get rails and planks and help her haul the mare
out.

Her parents were strict, but she minded them carefully—all except
in one area: snuff. "They whopped me for dippin' snuff. I craved
snuff. We'd make it out of Pa's homemade tobacco. I bet you I
couldn't even tell you th'times [my mother] whipped me for that."
With her own age as perspective, she has a special feeling for older
people who are left alone. She remembers with a chill recent visits to
the home of an old friend, taking her a little glass of jelly, or of pickled
beans or kraut each time. "But she ought t'see more people than my
old ugly face. Her neighbors aren't a'doin' their duty." Another
friend, also living alone, shakes so bady she can't fill her pipe un-
aided. "She'd crumble tobacco up in her lap and put it in her pipe,
and ashes and all'ud pour out. I asked her if she wanted me t'fill it up
fer'er. 'Well,' she said, 'honey, I'd just be glad, for I'll never get

t'smoke.' I filled it up fer'er, and every time we went over, I had
t'clean her pipe up. And she was so proud of it, th'poor old thing. I
just felt sorry fer'er."
Anna is luckier than most. An old childhood friend named Will
lives with her now, and they help each other. Even so, she is sometimes
depressed. Recently she told us, "I made do with what I had . . . Now
I just set here waitin' t'leave this country." But more often she is
happy, open, warm, busily engaged in little needlework gifts for
friends. And she remembers: "Life was sweet. You enjoyed every min-
ute of it."
RHONDA BLACK
[We asked Anna to begin by telling us the kinds of things from her
childhood that she remembered most vividly.] We never had a dose
a'medicine in our house to give young'uns. There was herbs they'd get
and make tea for us. And my daddy'd go out and get new nails out of
th'store, put'em in a bucket, pour water over'em. And when they got
that water rusty, that's what we took for blood medicine.
And [a woman that was pregnant] never went to a doctor. Their
mother learnt them t'have children. They never went to a doctor. And
a woman that was pregnant wouldn't of got out for a man to seen her.
If she was by herself when a man walked up, she'd bow up and stick
her head out th'door thataway t'talk to'em.
If we all went anywhere, we were charged to behave ourselves.
"Now I better not hear a thing. Now you'uns behave." And now it
was "uncle" and "aunt" everywhere we went. Yes, sir. And if there
were people sittin' around to hear, and my daddy was a'talkin', and
us young'uns over there, well [pointing a finger], that's all he had t'do
if we spoke to one another or moved. There was no talkin' done.
But Daddy was funny too. He had us t'play, and he'd play with us
blindfold in th'house when we were young. And on Christmas when
th children would come in—th'neighbors always visited one another
then—he would play a finger game. He'd make us put our four fingers
down thataway [hanging]. I forget just this minute what he called it.
And he'd count'em, y'know, and whichever it came out on, he had
somethin' we had t'do. We'd have t'go foot [go and do it. Apparently
there was some sort of rhyme or verse that went along with the count-
ing, and the person's finger that the verse ended on would have to go
and do some little thing. Then the counting would start again until all
the players had had to do something].

Then he'd play club fist. Stack up, and he had a great ceremony
he'd say. He'd knock it off, or take it off. [The person who starts
makes a fist with the thumb of that fist sticking up. The next person
makes a fist around that thumb sticking his own thumb up for the next
person to lock onto, and so on until there is a vertical stack of fists, all
interlocked. Then the person whose fist is on the bottom removes it,
says, "You want me to knock it off, take it off, or let the crows pick it
off?" The person whose fist is on top grips the thumb beneath it
tightly, tells how he wants the other to try to remove his fist, and then
tries to keep him from doing it. The game continues like this until all
the fists have been removed.] If we said, "Knock it off," you bet he
knocked it off!
And there was another game [called "slap, hug, and kiss." One
player would sit in a chair blindfolded. Another player would stand
behind him, and the rest of the players would be in a line in front of
the blindfolded person. The one standing behind would make a silent
signal that meant either a slap, a hug, or a kiss. Then he would ask the
blindfolded person to call out the name of one of the players in the
line. The blindfold would be removed, and that person would have to
go to the player whose name he had called out and do to him what-
ever the silent signal had dictated.]
And he just played with us, and enjoyed playin' with us like that.
Sometimes my grandmother came to visit. She always went horse-
back, and she'd come to our house. Lord, we thought she was
th'queen of th'world. Oh, we were so proud she couldn't hardly get off
her horse. We just nearly pulled her off, y'know. And just loved her.
And she'd bring us a biscuit, and now you talk about somebody bein'
proud—and stick candy. Oh, we'd be so proud to see Grandma. And
sometimes she'd bring us apples when they'd come in.
And whenever we come in from school, we had t'take our clothes off
right then and do whatever chores they left for us t'do. Then we had
chores th'next mornin', and then we'd put our school clothes back on
and our mother combed our heads and see'd that we was perfectly
clean. We got panties, and they was made out a'bleachin', and they
had t'be ruffled around th'legs down here at th'knees. They had t'come
under th'knees. And in th'winter we went barefooted, and when we
did get shoes, they were homemade shoes. And you got your stockin'
t'come up over this knee here, and your bloomers went down in
th'stockin'.
The first hat I ever had on my head was bought for me. They made
bonnets for th'women and bonnets for th'children—little stitch bon-

nets with ruffles around it. And th'first hat I ever got—I guess I was
about ten. It was just a straw hat, and it had just a cotton band. And
there was a sort'a spotted ribbon that crossed there and hung down a
little bit off th'brim, y'know. They weren't too wide. Boy, I'm a'tellin'
you, I was th'proudest thing in that hat that ever was a'comin'
t'Sunday School. Where there was a window, I'd turn my head and
check that ribbon. I was richer over that hat than anybody would be
today of a fine car.
[Here Anna remembered something that happened to her when she
was about five years old.] One time, me and my mother was started
across Middle Creek. We went t'go up there t'get peaches. They had
orchards, y'know. Plenty of'em. And we got there before it started
t'rain—awfullest storm they'd been.
We got over there about milkin' time, and th'creek was up just
a'rollin muddy—just as muddy as could be. Well, there was a woman
tendin' a corn mill, and she wanted t'go across. Her cow was on
th'other side of th'creek. And they had a two-plank footlog across
th'dam where it poured over. And I wanted t'tote her bucket that she
was a'gonna' milk in. I thought that would be a help to her. I was just
a little feller, but I was big enough t'tote th'bucket.
And we started across there, and I had t'go in front, and Ma was
comin' behind on th'footlog. And th'water a'pourin' down here. When
I got about th'middle, th'footlog, me and th'bucket went off down
th'river! We went just over where it poured off.
My mammy waded out, and that woman bent alders over from
th'bank of th'creek fer her t'hold to, y'know. She got t'th'middle of
th'ford, and I had sunk, and I was a'holdin' to a rock clenched in
th'bottom of that creek. And th'water come t'her chin right there. But
she waded to me, and my bonnet—I had on a homemade woolen dress
made on a old wooden loom, and a bonnet and big sack apron but-
toned up my back—and I can remember that dress just as good! And
she pulled me out, and her a'screamin', and th'other woman—she had
t get down in it and get wet all over, y'know, pullin' me out and up
over that big rock. She pulled me out under one arm, and th'woman
then bent th'bush back to her and she got a'hold of that and waded
out. And I was dead, y'know—water runnin' out of my ear and out of
my mouth. And I was limber as a dishrag, and she just had me
a hangin' across one arm. And we went up to another family and they
stripped me and shook me—and I never knowed anything till three
o'clock in th'evenin'. And I've never heard out of my left ear good
since. If I've got that ear to you, I can't hear you as good as I can out

of this'un. And since then, my head swims every time [I have to cross
water]. If there's anything I can get t'chew on—a stick or anything—
I can cross a broad log [but unless she has something to chew on to
keep her from getting dizzy, she can't cross water].
[Thinking about her own childhood got her thinking about young
people today.] They want different things, y'know, that we never
seen and never heard tell of. And a young'un ain't as proud of a big
bicycler'tricycle'r gun or things like that as we were of a stick of that
old "Long Tom" chewin' gum, or a stick of red candy.
They've got money now. It's not so important. It's good t'have, but
if you're gonna lay it away and worship it, you just as well go down
there and pick up as many rocks as you have dollars and lay them
away, and they'd do you just as much good. If you worship your
money, you're not worshipin' God.
It's like livin' in a new world. Oh, Lord, it ain't nothin' like—well,
look at church. Why, they're turnin' in their seats lookin' back t'see
who comes in. They ain't listenin' t'th'preacher. Or lookin' t'see what
kind of dress you wore today or how good it's made.
We used t'have t'get th'Bible and take and read a verse and get it by
heart and say it in Sunday School. And we had t'get th'preacher's text
in church. We had t'look at him and get his text and tell my grandma
when we went home where that text was at, and she'd read it t'us by
heart. We had her t'tell it to. If we didn't, she'd say, "Now ain't you
ashamed of yourself t'go t'church and not know where th'preacher's
text was from?"
And she'd say, "Children, nobody knows your heart, only you'uns,
and you better keep it good. You have t'stand on it; we don't."
[She also believed that no person was perfect—not even the preach-
ers.] They put on their britches just th'same as your daddy puts his
on. That's exactly what Grandma always said.
[Her advice to young people today]: Live close to the Lord and let
him put it on your heart. And don't tattle. I don't say you do, but you
asked me for my opinion. Live and be truthful and honest whatever
comes. Tell th'truth. Sometimes it hurts, but let'er pop. I'd tell th'truth
on my daddy just as quick as I would on a rank stranger that I've
never seen. Some people would do some other way [besides telling the
truth] to save'em if it was just their own kin, and if it was somebody
else, they'd tear'em all to pieces. Now, that's just exactly th'nature.
And my advice is t'any young person to take th'Lord first and be hon-
est and truthful. And never you lose confidence in nobody [cause them
to lose confidence in you]. You'll never get it back.

I try my best to learn just what th'Bible said. You can't [be perfect]
all th'time. You'll maybe do a little somethin' that don't please God,
but vou don't get forgiveness for that, all th'same. And be friendly and
good to ever'body, and especially to old people, folks you love.
God can put it on your heart or mine anything he wants you t'do,
and I know he can. He has mine. Pray about things you don't know
what t'do about. It'll come to you just as plain.
And I try t'be all th'same alike. I don't talk about people. I don't
say no harm about nobody and all they do. It says in th'Bible t'do unto
others as we wish t'be done by, and I feel that way about that. And I
feel like if you're in earnest and you got faith in th'Lord and ask him
for anything, he'll put it right on your mind.
[But if you're bad] and slip and hide and steal somethin' from some-
body and don't want them t'see you, well, now, that's against God.
You'll be caught up with sooner'r'later. You can talk with people and
from their talk tell that lots of'em's tattlers. We have lots a'long-
tongued people; lots of'em. And you can just sit and listen, and you
can catch'em. I just wait and never say a word about it. I just wait,
and sometimes it ain't no time till they're caught.
Kindness and love is th'main thing. Now that's my advice. It's good
t'know you've got a friend. It's love. Just like I made [a friend] out of
you. I see people that their looks and their ways just a'gives t'you, and
you love'em. And th'next time you see'em, you love'em better.
I've not had too much of a happy life since my old man died. And
after my children left, I just felt like I was alone in th'world. And
when all my people died—everyone that passes on out, I just feel like
I'm further and further away. Yes, sir.
So now I knit socks a lot. I just love t'do that. If I ain't got anybody
t talk to me, now I'm bound t'have somethin' in my fingers. If I'm able
t'hold my head up, I'm bound t'have somethin' in my fingers t'employ
my mind.
[But despite the fact that Anna has weakened somewhat with illness
and age, and despite the fact she is often alone, she is a long way from
surrendering.] I've been made fun of for bein' old-fashioned, but it
don't matter t'me a bit in th'world. If anyone tries t'run over me,
they'll find they've run up against a stake that won't budge 'cause it's
made out a'locust! I've always done th'work of a man. God's been
good t'me. He's given me strength.

his chapter on midwives
and granny women was
most revealing and even
startling to me. Too often I assume that the modern hospital, adequate
transportation, and medical doctors were available to my ancestors
just as they are to me. This was not the case, as these interviews so
vividly illustrate.
Back in the days when doctors were scarce, it was essential that a
midwife be near. I realized the dependability and usefulness of a mid-
wife as she delivered a healthy baby. With kindness, consolation, and
determination, she carried on her work—always willing to help a
family in need.
This article was a challenge and an inspiration to me, and I admire
these women for giving up their own personal lives, with little pay, to
bring new lives into this world. It showed me a rare human quality
possessed by so few people today in their work. The midwife of bygone
days had what it took to be successful in her work: true devotion.

Nurse, nurse-midwife, and teacher, Mrs. Josephine K. Brewer. "Jo"
Brewer was directly involved in the formation of a maternity clinic in
this county that, among other things, worked to train midwives, many
of whom had been practicing without professional training.
E. L. Bishop—M.D. and Director of Health, TV A—talked about
the clinic in depth in a pamphlet published on August 15, 1943, as
part of the "New Dominion Series" from Charlottesville, Virginia.
Commenting on the fact that the Atlanta daily papers had been edi-
torializing on the need for maternity centers in rural Georgia, Dr.
Bishop expressed the irritation of the Clayton community "that the
proposal was treated as a brand-new idea brought up by city folk for
their friends in the country." He quoted the Clayton Tribune:
We have had here in Rabun a full-fledged county mater-
nity home for the last eight months. That's where the move-
ment originally began. The big city papers don't seem to
realize that Rabun County is in Georgia.
. . . Rabun County is in Georgia. It is in the extreme north-
eastern corner. It is entirely rural and largely mountainous.
Except for the small town of Clayton, the population is scat-
tered. Many families live in isolated hollows or on mountain
farms separated from their neighbors by high ridges and poor
roads . . . Rabun is the kind of county in which people could
easily sit back and say, "But we can't do anything about it."
They have not done this, and the reason seems to be that a
few forward-looking citizens have helped others to see that it
can happen here in Rabun.
. . . The Maternity Center is a bit of real pioneering. It
is one of the very first of its kind in the rural south . . . No
one had any idea of setting up a charity institution [but] no
one was to be turned away because of lack of funds. The Cen-
ter was for all mothers. An arrangement for payment in fruit,
vegetables, chickens, or day labor by a male member of the
family made it possible for even those without cash to meet
their expenses.
Use of the Center has exceeded the most optimistic hopes
. . . Rabun County not only is recognizing the right of every
baby to be well born bui also is finding many ways to assure
its continued well-being.
The three local doctors are also among the beneficiaries . . .
They are relieved of long drives over mountain roads; of te-
dious hours spent in isolated cabins; and of the need to strug-
gle with facilities inadequate to their needs in the best of
homes and a menace to life in the worst.

MRS. JOSEPHINE K. BREWER: Mrs. Effie Dickerson and Mrs.
Etta Owens were about the best local midwives I've ever known, and
I've known them in different parts of the state. Midwives [also known
as granny women, or neighbor ladies] used to serve each/section of
the county. We did have granny women in nearly every valley of the
county, like Persimmon, Liberty, Bridge Creek, Germany, Chechero.
Sometimes the neighbor lady was not a trained neighbor lady. She
hadn't had the first elements of what to do in a situation like that. And
then, on the other hand, we had some good midwives. And out of
those, I'll talk about a few I remember best. Mrs. Effie Dickerson and
Mrs. Etta Owens—I think they were very well loved. And I'll say this:
they were the ones that came to the regular monthly meetings—classes
held at the Health Department—beginning in 1939. They came in,
had instructions in anatomy and what to do at the time of delivery,
and they were taught noninterference. That means not to do internal
examinations, because mothers could and did die from what we called
"childbed fever"—puerperal sepsis. Some midwives would examine
the mother with unscrubbed hands—no sterile gloves. They'd give ex-
aminations, and many times the mother died later from childbed fe-
ver. What I'm getting around to saying is that our ladies [the ones
trained at the clinic] had a very good record. I think they did do
as they were instructed, and they didn't do these examinations that
were really illegal as far as granny midwives go.
Mrs. Etta Owens lived in Mountain City, and Mrs. Dickerson lived
out from Tiger on the Liberty Road, and when she was getting ready
to go to a place, the husband would come for her. But she preferred,
and so did Mrs. Owens, that they contact her ahead of time so she
could say to them, "You know, you must be examined by a doctor to
see if you are a normal case, because granny women are only supposed
to take normal cases." They shouldn't take anyone with high blood
pressure or with infected kidneys or swelling, and other abnormal
symptoms, because these are three symptoms of toxemia, which means
the mother might go into convulsions at the time of delivery. The
blood pressure could get very high, and that's why these women liked
to be contacted before the actual delivery date.
Now these women that they attended could go to the private doctor,
if they wanted to, or they could come regularly, without cost, to the
Health Department clinic and get their checkups. Then the granny
midwife would feel that she was safe in taking these cases because
they'd been very well taken care of during their pregnancy.
The midwives had little midwife bags. Mrs. Dickerson and Mrs.

Owens had very clean bags—we had bag inspection. Certain materials
were supposed to be in them. They weren't supposed to have any un-
authorized drugs—any kind of thing that would make the patient
sleepy during confinement—and they were supposed to keep the bag
very clean. And after each delivery they had to clean their bags—wash
them with soap and water and launder the towels and things that they
carried—and put them out in the sun. They were also taught to put
their dressings in the oven of the stove and bake them. That would kill
the germs.
To train them, we had a very large wooden box. At the bottom and
on the top, there was a simulated abdomen and perineum—just like
the mother—so we could actually teach them the mechanism of labor,
and so we could teach them what was going on inside. There was a lit-
tle baby doll with the model too, which we could pass on down
through the birth canal. We also had a lot of books and pictures for
them to study, and we had a blackboard that we used in the lectures.
Those women knew pretty well the anatomy when they got through
with the classes. They also knew some signs and symptoms of abnormal
conditions so they wouldn't get too far along in a delivery before they'd
see if they needed to call in a doctor.
We used to go out on home deliveries with them when they would be
called. We had a special project here—we would go out at night or
day, anytime we got calls—and we would have actual teaching at the
bedside, too. But I didn't teach them in such a way that the patient
would lose confidence in the midwife. That would have been a bad re-
lationship. So we just worked together on the delivery, and just when
we could, we'd discuss about certain things relating to that delivery.
I m talking about learning scientifically rather than something they've
just grown into from young girls.
I would also like to tell you about when the midwives kind of went
out of practice here in Rabun County. Some of them had gotten sick,
some had died; and the ones that were still working weren't able to
carry on many deliveries, so it looked like we had to make some kind
of plan for the people of Rabun County. So we worked with various
clubs and governmental officials. Miss Lula Smith, who was also a
Public Health nurse, worked with me on it. And the Welfare Director,
Mrs. Vassie Lyon; and the Ordinary of the county, Mr. Frank
Smith; and Dr. Green was interested. And we decided that we needed
a little hospital or center where people could be looked after. They
could be given more care than they could get in the home. Then we
decided to make it a maternity center.

So I went to Atlanta to see Dr. Abercrombie, who was then Direc-
tor of the State Health Department, and he said, "If you'll go back up
there, and you all will start something on your own with no outside
help, I'll guarantee you that in six months' time, I'll put you in touch
with a foundation that will help you financially. But you've got
to show that you can do something on your own."
So we did start. And just a few days before we opened, we ran
over to Greenville, South Carolina, to see their "Maternity Shelter,"
as they called it. And they wanted us to say that we got the idea
from them, but we had to say no. We'd been thinking about a place
like this for a long time. They offered us a hundred dollars a month
if we would say that we were an outgrowth of them, but we didn't ac-
cept the money because we were not. We were ready to open, almost,
and we knew we could do as well.
We started out with laundry baskets for little babies to be put in.
Each time a little baby was expected, we had to run out, or ask
Mrs. Lyon or Miss Smith to scour the countryside for another laun-

dry basket so we could have some place to put the baby. One of the
doctors thought that we could never fill this place up and that it
would never be used. He didn't believe the women would come to it.
But we learned right away that that was not true. They did like it!
Dr Green and Dr. Neville were real helpful and anxious for us to
open this place.
Mrs. Dickerson at this time had to quit doing a lot of deliveries,
and I needed some one person to help me start the maternity home
because we knew we would be working night and day to get it
started. I asked her if she would help. She and I were the only ones
that were working full time, and we worked there for days and nights,
and we had to be on call all the time. One of us was there all the
time, and we nearly worked ourselves to death.
So next we had Mrs. Vickers, who was employed as a cook, be-
cause before that, "Miss Effie" would sleep during the day, but
she'd get up and fix the meals and then go back to bed because she
had to be at work at night. She'd get some sleep between times, and
I was the nurse on duty. That couldn't work that way, although
outside people gave us a lot of help with sheets and pillowcases and
blankets, and helped us get laundry baskets for the babies. But they
weren't there to do the actual work. It was just the two—then the
three—of us.
And as time went on, we got so busy that we had to have another
person there, so we hired a young woman who had never had any
nursing training at all, Miss Leila Belle Wall. She had worked in a
dentist's office. And she became an excellent nurse's aid. And as time
went on, we got more people.
Mrs. Dickerson worked a while, and she saw that she couldn't
hold out because she had to go up and down stairs, and they
were so narrow that when a baby was born and the upstairs rooms
were filled, we had to wrap the patient in blankets, and the doc-
tor and Miss Effie and myself would take her on a stretcher, outside
the house, downstairs to a lower room. We had to do that regardless
of the weather because all three of us plus the patient couldn't make
the narrow staircase.
We needed that maternity home. One day [before it was opened]
went out to make a home visit, and this lady was practically out of
herr head, and her blood pressure was very high. And Mr. Clyde
Ramey had loaned us a bed that we had in the back of the Health De-
partment. I knew this lady would probably die if something wasn't
done and soon. So I came back to town and called the doctor and Mr.

building in the county. The building is now the office for the Highway Depart-

was born here in September 1940.
R. E. Cannon. They had a stretcher, and they went so far in their van,
and then they had to take the stretcher out and take it to the house—
quite a distance—and they stretchered her back to the vehicle and
brought her to the Health Department and we started working on her.
Dr. Tom Dover was the doctor we could reach first. We began to
get her blood pressure down, and she delivered, and the lady still
doesn't remember about it. She was so far gone into her toxemia of
pregnancy that all she knows is what we tell her. That was our first
real maternity home patient, even though it was in the Health De-
partment. As far as I know, that was the first woman in Rabun County
whose baby was born outside of her own home. That was September
1940.
The first woman who had her baby born in the Home was Mrs.
Robert Singleton. Mr. Singleton was the postmaster who just retired
here in Clayton. Their son, Bobby, was the first child born in the ma-
ternity hospital. That was on November 22, 1942. We opened the
home on November 20, 1942. In fact, we were hardly ready with any-
thing.
It's kind of sad, in a way—the passing of an era, you might say.
The fast life we live now, and all the transportation, all the roads
that we have. I'd like to add this postscript: people used to be proud
to be born in Rabun County. In fact, they came here from North
Carolina, South Carolina, Hiawassee—every surrounding town and
county—to born in the maternity hospital. They liked to come to
our place, and they'd beat a path to the door. There were magazine

============================================================

MIDWIVES AND GRANNY WOMEN

articles all over the U.S. about the teaching program and the good
care the people got there. The doctors would look after the mothers
themselves, and if they couldn't get there, they told me to go ahead
and do the deliveries rather than calling another doctor in. So I had
many deliveries myself in the maternity hospital. People wanted to
come to this hospital.
Now there seems to be a kind of fad to go away from Rabun County
to have their babies. I wonder why, because we still have a good
place and local doctors. And the funny part is that even those who
do go away to outside hospitals will come in and ask Mrs. Martha
Thomas, the Health Department clerk, to have the baby's birth certif-
icate recorded in Rabun County! Well, that's impossible. We think
that if they would like their children to be said natives of Rabun
County, then those babies are going to have to be born here to say
so. In cases where the mother's condition is bad and the doctor thinks
she will need surgery, I think it's fine to go to an outside source. But
we have good ways of taking care of them here—good hospital,
doctors for deliveries—much better facilities than we used to have;
that's for sure. But, still, the education of the patient about family
nutrition, home hygiene and sanitation, baby and child care and
other health topics can't be taught in the busy, overcrowded hospitals
of today like they were back in the good old days.
Midwives in the area had a rather checkered career. There were
some women, for example, who never bothered with them. As
Ethel Corn said, "Now some women'ud have their babies by theirself
and take care of'em and get up and go on back to th'fields t'work.
I've heard Mommy tell of one woman she knowed a'doin' that.
She said she'd had some of her babies out in a field and brought'em
up and layed'em in the shade and went on about her work."
And, of course, there were times when the poorly trained midwives
were completely at a loss as to what to do to save either the mother
or the child. At such times, a doctor was essential. Anna Howard's
terrifying experience with just such a situation occurred when, "I got
hung and fell over th'fence. Th'baby was lodged in my side and had
t'be turned before he could be born. They had an old midwife with
me, but I'd suffered so long they said I wouldn't live and they went
and got th'doctor—an old man who couldn't even go horseback. But
they was a man that just married and moved close t'us, and he had
a buggy, and so Paw got that buggy and went off after th'doctor and

wrapped him up in a blanket and brought him. And that old [mid-
wife] sat in th'corner.
"And I said, 'Doctor, I want you t'tell me. That old midwife didn't
know what was th'matter did she?'
"And he said, 'No. There ain't a woman in th'world except a
doctor that could remove that. It sort of growed to your side.' He had
to take th'baby."
For many people, however, midwives were the ideal solution;
and for some, they were the only solution. Women were having babies
faster than doctors could get to them, and they simply had to have
help. The midwives were there, and in the course of their heyday, they
touched an amazing number of lives:
Mrs. Robert Avery: "It used t'be all they had nearly back in my
early days. About all my family was delivered that way."
Mrs. Andy Webb: "I'd rather have a midwife anytime as a doctor.
They know their business, and a doctor don't care. You got that, did
ya'? I ain't no hand fer a doctor. I want ya' to know and understand
it. I ain't. He might do somethin' t'help your back, and then he'll
reach out and get your pocketbook and that's all he wants. When
I get in pain and get t'hurtin' or get sick, th'midwife's th'one I go
to. That's th'only one will help anybody if they ain't got a big pocket-
book."
Mrs. Jan MacDowell: "My mother was a granny woman for about
all of th'community. They come after her 'cause she was their doctor.
People'd come after her, and she'd just always go. They just de-
pended on her same as th'doctor."
And Beulah Perry remembered one of the most vivid scenes of all:
"Most of th'old womens in those days smoked cobbed pipes. You'd
see those old ladies comin' down th'highway smokin' a cobbed pipe
and with that little black bag in her hand. Our favorite old lady
was called Aunt Haddy Corner, and we would see that old lady
comin' way off—I guess as far as from here t'th'highway. Well, if we
saw that old lady comin' down th'road with that smoke from her
cobbed pipe, we'd know that it was Aunt Had Corner, and we would
watch and wait till she got near, and we could see that little black bag
in her hand, and we'd say, 'Yonder comes Aunt Had. She's carryin'
somebody a little baby' "
Some families regarded their midwives so highly that they gave
baby girls the first name of the midwife as their child's middle name.
And there were thousands of midwives in the mountains. As Jo
Brewer told us, "Over Georgia alone, we had thousands of granny
midwives. They are dying out now, though. In the state today there

are about eighty-five granny midwiyes who are over sixty-five years of
age, and there are only 196 total. They used to be up in the thousands.
Even when I started in public health in 1939, they had thousands do-
in their part in the delivery of children. Rabun County dwindled
down to absolutely nothing several years ago as far as granny midwife
deliveries go."
We asked a few women what the old midwives carried around
with them, and the replies ranged from more elaborate midwife bags
to nothing at all. Mrs. Jan MacDowell said, "She didn't carry a
thing but herself. They was always prepared for ever what they had
t'have, and she never did take a thing." In agreement with this was
Mrs. Andy Webb, a midwife herself, who claimed she didn't carry
around anything at all. Anna Howard almost became a midwife
who carried a well-equipped bag, but she decided against it finally:
"Well, you carried packs of literature of different kinds. Th'nurse
came here t'see me and she fixed me up a bag. I give mine all back,
though. They just ran me crazy." Mrs. Lawton Brooks, on the other
hand, knew one granny woman who carried "scissors, thread, clover-
ine salve. That's about all they ever carried."
Mrs. Elizabeth Patterson, whose mother was a midwife, carried a
number of things with her whenever she made a call. A story that
Mrs. Patterson told us about her mother not only detailed the materials
she carried, but also gave some insight into why her mother was so
careful and conscientious: "She said one reason what started her to
being a midwife—she'd had children, and once she had a midwife
that really let her suffer a lot. After that, she had a good midwife—
'Aunt Lizzie' Keason* they called her. And she was such a good
Aunt Lizzie" Keason was one of the most well-known of the Rabun County
midwives. She is gone now, but when she was still alive, at eighty-seven,
Billy Dilworth wrote of her in an article for the Anderson Independent: "A
little old mountain lady who used to know every family within miles of this
peaceful but busy mountain town [Tiger] is taking on a new pastime these
days . . . spending these Spring mornings in her garden. Or watching after
several of her cows . . . 'Many's the time I left home before daylight and re-
turned after dark,' she related. 'I remember bringing nine children into the
world for one couple. I walked through snow and ice—more than two miles . . .
I didn't lose a single mother or baby in those more than 525 times. I thank God
for that.'
"She knows what poor financial conditions mean, too. 'When Harve and I got
married, he was making fifty dollars a year. That was big money,' she recalled.
'Back then, twenty-four pounds of flour and a half gallon of kerosine did us a
whole 
year.

'The little mountain lady, whose hands showed work, had built a city
of more than 525 persons—an average American small town."

midwife, Momma copied her, and said, 'Well, when she's not here,
I'll help th'ladies. I won't let'em suffer.' She said right then she made
up her mind she was going to help ttvpoor women if she could.
"Aunt Lizzie delivered me. That's who I'm named after. They
called her 'Lizzie,' but my name's Elizabeth, and that's who I was
named after. But Momma had a lot of experience and caught babies
before she kept a record of it; but then she went to a school . . . and
then she got her license out here in Rabun County at th'Clinic up
there. Momma got her a bag and always had her certificate in it so,
you know, if anybody questioned her or anything. A lot of times she
was scared. Sometimes with all you can do, even a doctor can't save
a lady. If they take childbed fever or milksick or somethin' like that
—Momma was always scared somethin' like that'd happen. Or blood
poison 'ud happen pretty much back then, and she'd carry her
license.
"And like I said, some of'em was careless and wouldn't wash their
clothes clean—wouldn't wash'em at all, hardly—and she'd carry
enough sterile clothes, you know, while th'woman had th'baby, to
put next to her. And she'd pack'em up beside that woman's bed and
tell her not to use nothin' else but that.
"And sometimes she has went to places they didn't even have a
diaper to put on th'baby, and she'd take old sheets—most of it was
linen, you know, they're good'n'soft—and she'd go and they didn't
have diapers, so she'd sit down and notch'em instead of hemmin'em.
Take her scissors and notch that baby a bunch of little diapers out of
what she'd carry."
Though some midwives were trained extensively, others had little
training at all for their job. Ethel Corn said, "It'uz a thing they just
got in by themselves. They didn't have no medical trainin' ner nothin'.
It was just their custom."
Mrs. Avery agreed: "No, she just began her work. She'd be caught
somewhere and have t'do th'work, and from then on she'd do it."
And Mrs. Andy Webb, who delivered over a hundred babies, said, "I
had no teachin' at all, and I know it'uz better then because they ain't
near as many women were dyin' then as they is now. They was
took better care of. I can't read, nor I can't write. What I've got,
God gave it t'me. And I'm proud of it, and I've saved many a life.
What God gives y'is right. I never lost a patient because I had th'Lord
with me, and I was willin' and ready t'do all I could t'save th'lives."
Our other contacts agreed that there was little, if any, formal
training before the opening of the Rabun Countv Clinic. Most remem-

bered, however, that after good training began, the picture changed
considerably. Mrs. Don Burnett said, "They didn't have t'have a li-
cense when they first began, as far back as I can remember. I didn't
know of'em havin' t'have'em until up later years. Then they got
t'where if they delivered babies, they had t'have a license. And then
they were finally just completely cut out of th'job at all. Weren't al-
lowed t'do th'job at all."
The appearance of midwives varied as much as their training. Mrs.
Lawton Brooks remembered that "they always had on a big white
apron and a white bonnet." Margaret Norton remembered them as
"looking like regular people, unless sometime they put somethin' on
th'top of their head, y'know—or put somethin' 'round their hair, and
sometimes partly around their face. But they didn't have no special
costumes that they wore. Just had on a clean apron—a white apron."
Mrs. Harriet Echols said that the midwives dressed ordinarily, "But
they had t'be clean. We didn't know anything about sterilization, but
they did know enough t'have ever'thing clean."
Curious about what kind of transportation the midwives had, we
asked Mrs. Marinda Brown, who told us that she always kept up with
what was going on, and she always knew just about when she would
be called on. Then, all they had to do was provide her some sort of
transportation (usually a buggy or a horse), and she'd be ready im-
mediately.
The others agreed, but said that sometimes they didn't even have
the buggy and horse. Mrs. Howard said she always walked, whether
it was at dinnertime or after midnight. Beulah Perry said, "Then the
granny women either walked, or they went on a wagon'r'somethin'.
Most all I can remember walked, or either there would be some-
body go get them in a buggy. There wasn't any cars in that day. And
sometimes it would take at least a half a day to get there."
Mrs. Webb showed her deep faithfulness for her job when she said,
"I went if I had t'crawl. I had no way t'go only walk. And now
th'doctors has got a way t'go but they won't go. And they lose a
whole lot more patients just by that. I know I'm right."
In advance of the birth of the child, little was done in the way
of prenatal care before the advent of public health. A few precautions,
however, were taken by some mothers. Ethel Corn remembered,
"Well, now, old midwives, when somebody was pregnant and after
they was so far gone, they would give'em sulfur and wine of cordia.
And they'd give that so they'd be nothin' wrong. You bought it at

th'drug store. It'uz nineteen percent alcohol. And it works in th'female
organs altogether. And it'll clear'em up . . . and th'baby can be
born without any trouble . . . And they'd always want y't'eat a
balanced diet. They'd try not t'eat nicknacks and sweetenin', but
they'd eat a balanced diet of vegetables and pure farm-grown stuff."
After the midwife clinic was formed, Mrs. Lex Sanders attended and
remembers, "They [expectant mothers] had t'go and take a checkup
within three months of their pregnancy. Well, this mother, if there
was any germs, y'know—certain diseases about her body—she would
take a blood test within three months of her pregnancy, and when
the baby was borned, it would be clear of th'diseases and she would
too.
You know, they'd treat her—give her shots and things. If we run
into a case like that, we had t'take an oath and not tell it t'nobody,
for th' doctor said that it would skip—I believe he said to th'tenth
generation. And he said probably a germ of this would pop up in
some honest mother, and he said they weren't allowed to say anything
about that in order to take care of our patients. To take care of honest

mothers, we weren't allowed t'get out and talk about that to nobody.
We had t'take an oath that we wouldn't say a word about that."
The time for the delivery was always a big affair. Almost everyone
we talked with agreed with Margaret Norton who said, "They'd have
women in t'hold their hand, or heat water'r'somethin'. There was al-
ways somethin' t'do. They always had four, five women plus a doctor
[midwife]."
Ethel Corn said that the old midwives didn't put towels on the
mother's head, but they held her hand. She also noted, "They had
t'have somethin' t'pull fer. They didn't have nothin', in one sense
of th'word, like they do in hospitals that they put up for'em to pull
to that'd give'em strength to bear down t'th'pains. They never did
give'em nothin' fer pain, and if th'pain stopped, they always had
t'have a doctor to start that labor back up. If th'labor stopped and
didn't come back on, they'd both be subject t'die.
"And midwives would help when they'd have pains and bear down
just like th'old-timey doctors did. They'd work down there to spread
them bones, y'know, till th'baby could be born."
Mrs. Anna Howard told us that she put towels on the patient's
head and examined her, making her sit up or lie down flat on her
back. She also said, "We held her hands and knees. They had t'be
three—one t'each knee, and one give out sometimes. And we'd hold'em
just as tight. She wasn't t'kick her feet out. We have t'set'em up and
get her feet up in bed." She also stressed washing one's hands well
before the delivery.
Mrs. Webb noted the importance of cleanliness too. She said that
she always washed her hands well with "disinfect." In addition to this,
however, she had a certain prayer that she would say both before and
after the baby was born. She would not, however, tell us the prayer
itself.
At the time the baby was born, a number of activities began. "Back
then, when a midwife went and delivered a baby," said Ethel Corn,
"they'd cut a long cord, and it'uz tied, y'know, with a string so it'd
fit. And they'd scorch a piece of cloth—put it on a shovel and put it
over a fire, and they'd scorch it right brown. And then they'd put that
next t'th'navel. They'd cut a hole in it and pull th'navel cord through.
They'd leave that on till that navel cord'ud come off. It generally took
from three, to five or six days for that. 'Course it had t'rot off.
"And then they would grease a cloth with mutton taller, and they'd
scorch th'cloth and put on it, and they'd always pin bands on it. This
day you never see a baby with a band on it.

============================================================
PAGE 285
============================================================

PLATE 340 Florence Brooks
"Baby's'ud rupture themselves, y'see, because that's a very thin
place [where the navel is], and so they'd put that on till it healed and
growed up firm. [Otherwise] if they cry hard or anything, it would
rupture'em and maybe ruin th'baby fer life. It'ud always be ruptured."
Florence Brooks told us that after the baby was born, the midwife
would cut the cord and tie it and then dress the baby. Then she'd
wait for the afterbirth [placenta, umbilical cord, etc.], carry it off,
and bury it. We asked her if there were any certain instructions as to
the care of the baby. Her reply was, "No. Nothin' only just t'keep its
navel cord greased with castor oil till it come off. And I don't reckon
they was such a thing as alcohol. We'd always put a little powder on
its navel after its cord come off t'dry it up." She also said there was no
tea given to the mother—only to the baby.
Anna Howard told us about a disease a baby could be born with
called "croupy." We asked her what it was, and she replied, "Choke
t' death. And, buddy, I've seen'em bom black as tar. Sometimes you'd
have t'pick it up and shake it. You shake'em, pull their mouth open,
and blow in their mouth . . . But we'd take them that come a'chokin'
-we'd throw'em up and blow in their mouth—I would. And then
take homemade syrup—jest a half a spoon full—and put a little water
in it and put it in its mouth with a teaspoon, and when we could get it

to swallow it, that would cut that phlegm loose and it would get its
breath."
She also told us about cutting the baby's umbilical cord: "I learned
to cut th'baby loose. You had t'cut it loose and tie its belly. You'd take
th'scissors and cut it. If you cut it right, it was all right. And that was
what scared me so bad. I was afraid I wouldn't cut it right. But I
did. I never missed it a time."
She also indicated the importance of breast feeding when she said,
"You never put a bottle on. Y'never heard tell of a bottle."
Apparently, at the time of birth, a common thing among most
babies was the hives. Mrs. MacDowell told us about her mother's
cure for the hives: "She made lots of tea. She believed in tea. She made
red alder tea for that."
Florence Brooks said, "Catnip tea, ground ivy, or red alder. It was
supposed t'break'em out and make'em have th'hives—which th'doc-
tors don't believe in now, and I don't either."
Mrs. Andy Webb told us that she used castor oil, black snake root,
and rattle weed to make teas to break the hives out. She said of hives,
"It looks sort'a like th'measles, but it ain't measles. Them's bold hives.
I've got mouse ear to make tea out of and save lives. It grows on a rock
sort'a in th'edge of water. And that'll cure th'bold hives. Right smart
a'difference. Th'bold hives works around th'heart, and th'other hives
just makes'em cramp and jump."
When we asked Mrs. Webb what she did after the baby was born,
she said, "I had t'take th'afterbirth with m'hands. I just washed
m'hands with disinfect and cre'lin (some kind'a medicine y'put in
water). I'd rather have it as t'have th'disinfect."
Ethel Corn told us the midwife would give the child catnip tea to
break the hives out and clear up the liver. She said, "They'll have'em
after they're born, and if them hives don't break out on'em—if it's
th'bone hives—it'll kill'em. You've got t'do somethin' to clear th'liver
up. And if you don't, they'll get yeller lookin'."
She also told us that when the baby was just born, the midwives
would often "feed him butter to cut the phlegm out."
Beulah Perry also agreed with the use of catnip tea. "If th'mother
didn't have enough milk, why they'd make catnip tea—go out and get
that catnip and make a little weak tea and feed those little babies
maybe two tablespoonsful till it got satisfied."
When asked what the mother was given after she had her baby,
Ethel Corn's reply was, "Always after they delivered a baby, it was a
big dose'a castor oil."

============================================================
PAGE 287
============================================================

MIDWIVES AND GRANNY WOMEN 
291
Mrs. Brooks told us the mother was given a dose of castor oil
before she had her baby, and sometimes paregoric after she had it.
Nearly all the women we talked to affirmed that a good long rest
was the best thing for the mother. Ethel, for example, said, "Well,
now before I was grown, I heard Mommy tell of'em havin' their
babv and gettin" up and goin' on to work. But now back when mine
was born, the doctor didn't allow me out of bed for nine days. And
he wouldn't allow me t'eat'r'set up in bed for three days. And you
know women had a lot better health when it'uz done thataway
than th'way they do'em now. That's one thing I think makes th'women
so weakly now when they have a baby. In one sense, it works like a cow
havin' a calf. You'll turn her out of her stall and she goes on a'pickin'.
Well, that's th'way th'doctors does now. They take'em to a hospital—
they won't go t'a home—they have t'be at a hospital. And th'baby's
delivered there. Well, in a hour's time after that baby's born, they'll
have'em up again and goin' and doin' and th'next day send'em
home. And I have knowed of'em sendin'em home th'day th'baby's
born. And they'd go back home and go t'doin' their washin' and
ironin' and all kind'a work like that. Well, that's against'em, and it's
really dangerous."
Mrs. Andy Webb agreed. "I never let my patients get out a'bed in
nine days. And now they turn'em loose th'next day. I know it's bad.
It ruins their health. I'd tell'em not t'eat no apples ner nothin' like
that that would hurt'em. I'd tell'em t'eat cooked fruit. And now
they just let'em eat what they want!"
Mrs. Brooks said, "Eat anything y'want except kraut and pickled
beans, and stay in th'bed for ten days. No gettin' up for ten days. It
sounds like a nice rest, but y'get wore out. I stayed in bed ten days
and I never had no back trouble—that was t'take care of your back."
Anna Howard agreed also: "That's th'reason women ain't stout.
They make'em get right up."
Mrs. Brewer's clinic also kept the mothers in confinement for a
long period of time. They used this period to advantage, however, as a
training period. The mother was kept seven days, and she paid two
dollars a day. The purpose of the program was to help the mother
so she didn't feel like she'd gotten into something she didn't under-
stand. "We had seven days to teach her to bathe the baby, handle the
baby, and let her learn health facts about the baby: why she should
put the baby down on the abdomen instead of on its back, for ex-
ample. Many babies can be found dead from choking on their own
milk."

============================================================

Anna Howard added some additional customs: "Now if it'uz a mis-
carriage, you could go and take apple tree bark and make a tea out
of it, and give'em a cup'a'tea. But no other time." She also told us
about washing the mother with a yellowish salve after she had had her
baby. "There weren't nary one a'mine that ever went through but
two good washin's until she got up." The mother was put on a very
light diet, but with good food to eat.
The amount of time the midwife stayed on at the home after the
child was born varied. Mrs. MacDowell, for example, claimed that
she usually stayed a week after the birth. Mrs. Echols remembered
that if the mother wasn't feeling well, "she'd be there for two weeks to
watch and see. They usually had someone else in t'do th'housework,
and th'older children could do th'other work."
Anna Howard said, "If it'uz born in th'mornin', you'd stay all
day . . . I've stayed with several—stayed a week, and then sometimes
I've stayed nine days. It was just accordin' t'how they got along."
In other cases, however, things would go along so well that the
midwife would only stay from a few hours to a day after the baby
arrived, and then go on to other jobs. Margaret Norton said, "Some-
times they'd have t'stay more than a day, or maybe they'd have
another case t'go to and have t'go and come back. I knowed that
t'happen lots'a times."
Almost none of the midwives were paid a great deal for their
services. Mrs. Marinda Brown told us the midwives were sometimes
paid in food or things they could use. Mrs. Algie Norton said that
they usually didn't charge anything. Mrs. Lex Sanders said that she
wasn't allowed to charge anything, and that it was the person's own
decision whether they wanted to pay her or not.
Mrs. MacDowell told us that people didn't pay the midwives, but
Ethel Corn said, "Yeah, they'uz paid, but it'uz just two or three
dollars. It wadn't no big prices like it is now."
Mrs. Howard claimed, "I never charged. I always was too sorry for
th'wife t'charge. They meant for me t'charge five dollars, but I never
did. But they'd give it t'me sometimes."
Mrs. Webb said, "If they wanted t'give me anything, I accepted
it. And if they didn't, why, it'uz all right. I was workin' for th'Lord—
not for th'people."
If they were paid at all, it seemed that it was seldom with money.
Few could afford that then. Mrs. Parker stated that sometimes they
would be paid with a twist of tobacco, but "they didn't have th'money
back then, and they didn't expect it."

============================================================

Mrs. E. H. Brown said, "The family gave them money if they had
a little money. If they didn't, they gave them something else. Maybe
somethin' t'eat. Half a gallon a'syrup, or a pumpkin'r'two, or some
corn, or somethin' like that."
Mrs. Echols agreed: "They usually charged about five dollars, but
a lot a'times if you had meat and molasses and anything that was
raised on th'farm that they didn't have, they'd take it in produce."
Deaths? They happened occasionally, but they seemed to be fairly
infrequent according to most of our sources. Mrs. Sanders, for ex-
ample, claims that she never lost a patient or a baby during her
career, and many of the others claim the same. In fact, many of them
believe that the patients did better then at home than they do now at
the hospitals. Mrs. Corn, for example, said, "You hardly ever heared
of one a'dyin', and you very seldom heared of one a'bein' deformed
in any way. My mother had nine children. They'uz nine of us. Most
all of'em had big families then. And they done better at home than
they do these that went and had they'rn at th'hospital. Now I had
seven, and ever' one a'mine'uz born at home!"
But superstitions regarding death were common, and certain signs
were much feared. Aunt Nora Garland, whose mother was a mid-
wife, talked at length about the "news bees" that are so common
around here: "Well, now, there's yeller ones—that's good news—and
they's black ones, and that's bad news. And you know, I hate to see
them things, too. I was in th'bed nine days before that baby was born,
and there's a little window right at th'head of my bed. And I
watched that news bee go out ever' day—that black news bee. He'd
come in and stand over my head (they go like they're a'talkin' noise,
y'know), and it'd go out th'window and go right across toward
th'cemetery. Of course, we thought we could keep that baby, and it
was a eight months baby, and there wasn't any hospitals then.
"So we lost our baby. It was buried right out here at this little
cemetery—right th'way the news bees went. So I believe in news
bees."
Other superstitions were also common. Jo Brewer talked of some
of them at length. "When a person was hemorrhaging, the old think-
ing was that if you turned an axe with the blade side up under the
bed, it would cut the hemorrhage. Now how that started, I'll never
know. I mean, it's just so ridiculous on the face of it that you wonder
how intelligent beings could believe it.
"Another thing that they believed was that if a mother was nursing

FOXFIRE 2
a baby and had to quit, and her breasts needed to be dried up, if
she would milk some milk on a hot rock, this would help dry up the
breast. Now I can see how that might have started. Expelling a little
milk gradually ivill help. But milking them on a hot rock! They could
have milked it in a towel or on the ground and it would have been as
good."
Mrs. Harriet Echols said, "If you put a knife under the pillow and
an axe under the bed, it will cut the pains. And they put a pan of
water under the bed when you had a temperature. That water was
t'cool th'atmosphere and make the fever go down."
But Mrs. Echols was quick to claim that she didn't believe them
herself—they had only been common in the neighborhood where she
had been raised. "That's just all in th'makin' because there's nothin'
to it. Because birth is a trial. It's a travail. With anything that's born,
th'mothers have t'suffer. And nothin' will prevent it until th'birth is
completed.
"Back then, those people made a livin' on th'farm. I'd stop in where
th'new babies would be born, and they'd talk about how much pain
they had until they put th'axe under th'bed . . . but that was just an
old wives' tale because it wasn't true. Nothin' that's born is born
without sufferin'. Some give you less pain than others."
Still other superstitions were those that were the result of stories
parents had told their children concerning birth. Beulah Perry, for
example, can remember vividly when parents didn't talk about such
things and would tell their children that "you went in th'woods. That's
where you'd find little babies—in th'woods."
We've come a long way since then; but still, there is something
immensely attractive and appealing about a midwife that will come
and stay and hold one's hand for as long as is necessary to make
everything all right. But perhaps more effective than anything we
could tell you about them are the stories they tell themselves.
RICHARD NORTON: I went after Doc Neville one time, ridin' a
horse. He had a Model T Ford. Well, th'roads was s'bad up here
that I come back t'his father's and got his saddle horse and took it
back [for him to ride].
They hauled lumber with wagons then, and they just kept that
road cut up till a car couldn't get up here. And then too 'cause a'that
awful cold and freezin' weather, it was just cut all to pieces. It was so

bad that th'horses would break through th'ice and th'mudholes and
just nearly pitch on their heads, y'know.
So I brought him up here on that horse. It was s'bad that we
just couldn't make no time on it then. We got here. We came right
on th'two horses; but they was really freezin' t'death cold, and they
was just wet with sweat. It'uz s'hard on them t'travel, y'know, through
that ice, and breakin' through it and fallin' and strainin' and goin'
on.
People don't know what hard times they was!
HARRIET ECHOLS: Well, y'know, honey, since th'olden days,
there's s'much about midwives—you ought t'get in on all this. The
old-time people thought that young people shouldn't know all th'facts
of life and ever'thing till they were grown. W7ell, if you're not gonna'
learn it while you're little and your parents teachin' it to y', how are
y'gonna get all this? Ever'thing about th'birds and th'bees?

she was young and took up th'practice of nursin'. And bein' a midwife
was her specialty. 'Course she took care of any kind of sick patient that
come along, 'cause as a small girl, from th'time she was eight'r'nine
years old and began t'do things, she went with her father. Said she'd
set up on th'horse and ride with him t'see patients.
And so she learned quite a bit. And she raised a family of nine,
and that midwifing was her main work t'make money. Her husband
died, and they had a farm, and th'boys worked th'farm.
Well, I learned how. I have delivered one baby, and I've helped
at a lot of home deliveries. When I delivered that baby, th'doctor
came about thirty or forty minutes after and examined ever'thing.
That is th'essential thing. You have t'have your water, wash your
hands, and you have t'examine th'mother t'know that ever'thing is
normal. You have t'see if th'baby's in th'right position to be bom
normally. And if not, then you've got t'know what t'do t'straighten
it out. And if you can't turn th'baby t'get it straightened out and it
comes feet first, then it usually dies because it strangles t'death—un-
less there's a doctor there t'take care.
It's a pretty scary affair. I wouldn't have wanted that t'be my
lifework whatever. Midwives used t'didn't have instruments. They
just had t'work with th'know-how. If anything was wrong, they
tried t'get a doctor. If they didn't, Nature just had t'do th'best it
could.
But when I delivered that baby, th'doctor come; and when he
got there, he said I did a wonderful job. And a'course I was scared
t'death. But somebody had t'do somethin', and th'other ladies . . •
they just expected th'neighbors t'come in and help.
But there's not too much t'do because it's usually over in an
hour'r'two. When Nature starts, it's a pretty tryin' time. But yet,
and still, it makes y'mighty happy when things are all right.
ANNA HOWARD [The following story unfolded when Anna How-
ard and her mother were summoned to deliver the baby of Mr. and
Mrs.—we'll call them Jones for the purpose of the story]:
I went to a family up here on this creek—they call hit the old
Curtis place. The man was a Jones, and he was married and they had
two children.
Well, when they sent for me an' Mother t'go there, he [Mr. Jones]
had got th'milksick [a disease thought to have been caused by drinking
milk from a cow that had eaten a certain plant that grows in dark
coves]; and his mother was there too.

Well it was a night—do you'n's remember way back the comet
was gonna pass? And that was th'greatest excitement that had ever
been And they come the awfullest storm that I have ever see'd in my
lifetime. And it was awful steep up there—part of th'way t'that little
log house—but me and Mother went.
[By the time we got there] the little girl'd got sick [Jones's eldest
daughter], and the old man [Mr. Jones] didn't know anything at
all. They had him on th'floor on a pallet, and th'little girl, just alive,
on th'other side of th'room. [There was a younger daughter there too,
but she had not gotten sick yet.]
So she [Mrs. Jones] was gonna have a baby. Hit was a six months
baby. His [Jones's] mother went and she got apple bark and made
tea for Mrs. Jones. That was to keep her from havin' th'baby. And
it wasn't an hour till she [the wife] took that milksick too.
[Mrs. Jones had the baby soon after she took sick.] Well, I'uz
a'settin' over in th'corner, and they gave me th'baby t'hold. His
[Jones's] mother done th'work a'takin' th'afterbirth—she just had
it t'do. My mother had t'oldest girl t'watch, and she was crazy as
she could be. His [Jones's] mother, then, had t'tend to her [Mrs.
Jones], and she'd put her head against th'headboard and she'd
climb. She'd climb that headboard and get up in spite of creation.
Well, that eldest girl died of that milksick, and my mother took her
and laid her out.
And th'man [Jones] got gone, and was nobody knowed where he
was. I'uz there and I had t'hold that baby, you know. It was
a'breathin'. It was a fully developed lookin' baby, and I'll bet you a
dollar hit would'a weighed six or seven pound. The biggest, fattest,
prettiest baby I ever saw. Well, it wadn't long till hit died in my lap.
Then I had hit t'dress, and my mother helped lay it out.
And then we got t'huntin' for th'old man, and he'd crawled off
irom behind th'stove and crawled clean around there, and he was
a'lyin' under th'bed that girl had died on. And we had t'get down
°n our knees and get him by th'feet and sneak him out. He didn't
know what he'uz doin'. He'uz crazy with th'milksick.
LA11 of a sudden they discover that Mrs. Jones and her youngest
daughter have disappeared too.] Well, when daylight come, we got
huntin' for them, and we couldn't find them nowhere. It thundered
and lightened and I don't see how she lived. We was just a'sweatin'
-me and m'mammy. And th'water goin' up th'hill and hit a'comin'
down. Hit wet us way above our knees.
And about time for sunup I said, "They've been a'loggin' in there,

and they've built a shed way down below th'house." And by gran-
nies, she'd took that young'un and went down there and stayed.
Ever'body was scared t'death.
Well, they'd sent after th'doctor, but he never come that night.
Not till th'next mornin' when th'sun'uz shinin' and hit had cleared
off. Th'doctor come and hollered "milksick" before he got in th'door.
You can smell it. Well, there was two funerals, both of'em children.
And he [Jones] lived, but he's been dead a year now.
That milksick, they'd get it from cows, y'know, back up in
th'mountains. And back here towards Mulberry there's a place, but
nobody's never found it. And they've tried all these here experiments,
and they've never found out yet how it come. It's bound t'come from
some mineral and settle on th'vegetables of a mornin' with th'dew.
But hit'll kill'em. They ain't no doubt about it.
MRS. ELIZABETH PATTERSON: [My mother, Mrs. Effie Dick-
erson] went to one place up here, and they had a boy who was men-
tally retarded, and he was grown. And they had a lot more children
besides that, and they had some other back in th'bedroom.
And they [the family] said that if they wronged him [the mentally
retarded boy] in any way, he'd get serious mad, y'know. And they
just couldn't do anything with him.
So he would come and sit and try t'watch Momma borned that
baby, and Momma just wouldn't have children'r'men around—ex-
cept she'd have their husbands—she thought that was all right t'help
if they wanted to.
But this boy just kept on, and th'mother kept on sayin', "You go
on out, son," beggin'im, y'know, and tryin' t'have her baby. And
th'baby just couldn't be borned.
So Momma, she just got kinda aggravated, and I'm tellin' you,
she got onto'im. She said she was scared to, but she knowed that
woman was sufferin' and needed to have th'baby. And she got onto'im.
And it kind'a didn't do no good, so she really got onto'im and
fussed'im out.
And she said they had old rails that they used to build fences with
just piled up out there by th'house. Anyhow, he went out there
and got an axe and went t'cuttin' them rails. She said he just cut
and never stopped.

Th'mother thought he would turn on Momma, and Momma said,
"Nah, I don't think he will. I think y'all haven't been quite hard
enough on'im. We all know you'll be sorry fer'im, but you've got
t'make them mind, y'know—even if they are a little bit off."
It wadn't long, while he was a'cuttin' them rails, th'baby was
borned. After that, she got th'baby cleaned up and th'mother, she
runned out there and called'im. She said she was afraid he would
set too exhausted—he was sickly anyway. And she called'im and
told'im to come and see his brother. . . . So he come in and was
Momma's friend thereafter. He would just see her in town and he
just loved her.
Lots of times when she went th'baby wouldn't be ready to be
borned, and she'd be hungry. She was always wantin' t'go eat. And
she'd get in that kitchen and go t'cookin' for all of th'family, and feed
th'rest of th'little children; and if it was nighttime, get'em fed and
ready for bed and out of th'way so th'baby could be borned.
And then, if they didn't go t'bed, she'd get'em fed and let th'husband
take'em someplace t'get'em out of th'way. Oh, she's seen some hard
times durin' that period of time, but she enjoyed it so we couldn't
do anything with her. After her health got t'fadin', we begged her
not to, but she went off lots of times when she wadn't able. But
finally she saw th'light, and she had t'give it up.
She told me some things they don't tell y'now—I mean, th'doctors,
y'know. I think they give you shots tryin' t'hurry you up, but Momma
said, with th'first one [baby], they always need t'take all th'time
they need. For God made'em to have that baby, and if they took a lot
of time, it wouldn't injure'em nowhere, y'know. And Momma would
make'em hold back to keep'em from tearin' when th'baby was born.
I was with her when Allen was born, and it couldn't be borned
on th'bed at all. And she'd heard tell of way back, th'midwives
put'em on the husband's lap. But Momma wouldn't do that—'fraid
it ud tear th'woman. So she made us fix quilts down in th'floor
so it would be hard. Th'bed was just too soft—mattress a'givin'—and
we needed some place hard. So we fixed it down in th'floor. And
th mother that'uz havin' th'baby, it wadn't but five minutes aftt' we
put her down there, th'baby was borned.
When she passed away [her mother], you never have seen th'flow-
ers from places she'd gone! And some of th'children would come
up to me and say, "If it hadn't been for her, I wouldn't a'been here,
y'know."

MARINDA BROWN: I was delivered by a midwife, and my younger
sister was delivered by a midwife. When my sister was born, I was right
about three years old.
We had been out. They sent us out somewhere. I seem t'remember
we used t'rake th'leaves a lot, you know, to bed our stock. And I
don't know why we'd be doin' it in June [when the sister was born],
but I've always gone through th'years with th'impression that we were
out in th'woods on th'side of th'road rakin' leaves.
And when we went back t'th'house, my sister was born: and this
midwife picked me up and helt me t'look at th'baby.
Now that is an impression that stayed with me all these years.
And I've talked t'my older sisters about it, and they say, "Oh, no!
That isn't right. That isn't right because they sent us off to th'neigh-
bors t'spend th'night."
But I've still got that impression.
MRS. ANDY WEBB: Well, one winter, I come up here t'my daugh-
ter's. And th'snow was that [knee] deep; and I had t'walk. I had
no way else t'go but t'walk. And I was might'near froze t'death when
I got there. And th'wind a'blowin'—they, my goodness!
I stood on my knees at th'poor side a'that bed and took care a'her
when I was s'numb I couldn't hardly stand up!

y'know. Russ Anders' wife, when she was borned [gave birth], it was
a awful stormy night. They couldn't get no doctor. That was my
first experience. I took care of Pearl.
Then they was a orphan girl, and none of her people would
keep her. She just stayed in town. Well, she just went up and down
th'streets ever' daytime; and ever' night, John A4ills let her sleep in

Somebody come t'me one day and said, "Why don't you keep her
till after her baby's borned?"'
And I said, "Well, I don't know."
Well, we had t'see th'Red Cross, y'know. So we went, and she had a
office there in th'courthouse. We went in there and seen her. All my
children was grown, y'know, and I didn't have any at home, so I
told them I'd take th'girl and take her t'th'doctor and see that she
was clear of diseases. And they said to take her to any doctor I
wanted to . . .
And I brought her home with me and kept her for six months.
Well, when her baby was due, she took sick. I called th'doctor
and he come and he said it was only in her head. Said he didn't
think there was a thing in th'world wrong with her—she just had it
in her mind that she was gonna have her baby [but he didn't think
she was].
Well, he left her three pills, and he told me how often t'give'em.
I give her th'pills, and just before I give her th'last'un, she was
awfully sick. I told her, "Now, th'doctor said if you took this pill
and there wasn't nothin' wrong with y', it would kill ya'."
She said, "Honey, give it t'me. I'd rather be dead than th'shape
I'm in."
Well, I gave it t'her and I waited two hours. I see'd that th'pill
wasn't goin' t'do no good, so I just [went ahead] and I delivered her.
And the next morning, well, my hands was kinda tired. I wasn't
licensed at that time. And I had this orphan girl there, y'know; and
I had t'be kinda particular about it. So I called th'doctor again,
and he come back up there. I was settin' there in front of th'fire
with th'baby in my arms, and when he come in 'at door, I said,
"Well, her mind is done delivered her!"
She had one a'th'finest baby boys that you ever looked at. And I
went t'th'Red Cross woman and said, "If they's any money in
th'treasure for that, give it t'some poor widow woman or orphan
child. That doctor's not entitled to it."
She said, "Miss Sanders, you get your license. We can't pay you.
We've got t'pay th'doctor." She said, "You get your license and you
can charge just th'same as th'doctor."
She told me I could meet her in th'courthouse, and I met her and
she granted me my license.
Well, then I'uz licensed for twenty years, but they depended on
me too much, and I got nervous sometimes . . . so I got th'doctor
t'sign for me t'have a rest. [On one occasion she found herself in a

cabin high on the side of a mountain alone with an expectant
mother, four young boys, and the mother-in-law, and no other help
in sight. She felt too much could have gone wrong.]
We was taught th'only wound there was about th'baby's body was
th'navel. And when we fixed up that navel, we wasn't allowed to
touch it. We had t'pick it up by th'cord that it was tied with, for
he said if it got infected, that'd probably cause th'death of that
baby after it was growed up.
And that, in essence, is the way Lex and others worked. Some of
their practices and beliefs have now long since been outdated, but
that hardly makes them irrelevant. By all counts midwifery was a
fascinating art that few people today realize even existed. Having read
this chapter, perhaps you were able to more fully understand the
hardships and responsibilities a midwife shouldered back when there
were no doctors. She successfully performed in an area that would
seem impossible for many of us to undertake today. For this and
more, the midwife of former days, who had the strength and courage
to do that which was needed to be done, should long be remembered.

OLD-TIME BURIALS
hen I was a child
on up till I was
grown," said Ethel
Corn, "seemed like I was drawn to go to any funeral whether I
knowed the people or not. I just had th'urge to go. What finally
stopped me from wantin' to go to funerals was when [a friend's] wife
died. And she had a baby. It wadn't but more'n a year old. And that
was th'pitifullest thing and got me the worst of anything I ever went
to. They took that baby up to see her, and when it did, it went
t'reachin' and cryin' t'save mama. And you know that backed me off
from wantin' to go to funerals."
Many superstitions and ghost stories have had their beginnings at
old-time burials and wakes and graveyards. Maybe it was the way
some of the supposedly dead people suddenly woke up, or the way the
bodies were hauled to the church for the dramatic ceremonies held
there. Nevertheless, the fascination was fact. Aunt Arie told us in
hushed tones of a neighbor who was shot during a fight and died with
his eyes open—"blared," she called it. "And you could see th'devil
in 'em—them fightin', y'know."
And Ethel Corn told us of a neighbor's wife who had to be dug
up and moved from the old family plot to a graveyard nearby: "And
she'd been dead for about twenty-odd years. They said when they
took her up and opened that lid, there was glass over it so no air
couldn't get in. And said she looked just exactly like she did when
[they buried her]. And then they raised that glass, and when they
did, said it all just went down flat to nothin'."

OLD-TIME BURIALS

Dr. Rufus Morgan, a retired Episcopal minister whose interview
ncludes this chapter, told us that it was easy for him to see how
superrstitions and ghost stories might arise in this connection. "I might
tell you one little story," he said. "Up here at St. John's Church [is
where it happened]. I was born in a log cabin the other side of the
church. One evening, my mother had been down to visit her parents
and was on her way back and was passing the cemetery at late dusk.
As she passed, she saw a white figure in the cemetery. She was rather
surprised. She stopped, and the figure just stood there. Then she
started on and the figure started after her. She stopped again, and
the figure stopped. She started on again, and it repeated the move-
ment. Finally she stopped for a longer time. Most people would have
beat a hasty retreat, but she waited and the figure came up to her. And
it was an Indian mother who had been at the grave of a child that
had been buried there.
"That's the way superstitions in regard to ghosts arise. They can
develop very easily if you are afraid.
"Another thing—my longest hike, which was something over two
hundred miles in five days, went from up above Albany, New York,
into Boston—the length of Massachusetts. I had a blanket and a frying
pan—just bare necessities—and I'd camp out overnight.
"Well, I got along toward the eastern part of Massachusetts, and I
couldn't find open space which was suitable for camping. It was
getting dark. By the time I left one town, I'd be in another.
"Finally I came to a cemetery by a church, so I said to myself,
'That'll be safe. Nobody'll bother me there.' So I went in and found
a nice place between two graves, and, wrapped in a blanket, I went to
sleep.
"Along ten o'clock or so at night, I felt something, and I couldn't
tell at first just what had waked me up. I listened and felt, and
finally I discovered it was just beginning to rain on me. So the
disturbance wasn't the ghost at all. Just the rain."
While working on this chapter, we learned to value the qualities
unselfishness and concern that people had for others in the time
of death and to appreciate the unlimited time they gave of themselves.
Showing their genuine sympathy, respect, and love for the family of
the deceased, people traveled great distances in wagons and on horse-
back to attend wakes, help dig and fill the grave, make the coffin,
wash and dress the body, and to help the family in any possible way.
And they did it, usually, free of charge. As Margaret Norton said,

============================================================

"Th'family didn't have t'pay nothin'. They dug th'grave free of
charge. Men went in together and dug th'grave. And you made
th'buryin" clothes, and you made th'box t'be buried in, and there
wadn't no payin' goin' on. Th'preacher never charged for a funeral—
for preachin' a funeral. They'll charge for funerals now, preachers
will. They're not supposed to. See, most preachers is paid by salary,
and that's one of his jobs. He ain't supposed t'charge y'. But many
of'em'll take anything."
We gained a new insight into people from seeing how they acted
during time of death and in comparing these old-time funerals with
today's, we were amazed at the differences. You'll see many of them
yourself.
BETSE WHILDEN and KAREN COX
As soon as a person died, a number of things were traditionally
done almost simultaneously: a bell was tolled announcing the death;
a neighbor was contracted to produce a casket (unless it had been
made in advance under the supervision of the person who had died);
relatives who lived away from the community were notified as quickly
as possible—sometimes by means of a letter edged with a black border;
and the body was washed and laid out in preparation for the wake
that would take place that night in the home of the deceased. The
"settin' up" was held in the home since, as Maude Shope said, "they
didn't have no funeral homes t'take'em to, y'know. If one was t'die
here last night, we laid'im out. What neighbors was already here
'cause somebody'uz sick would strip th'bed off and put'im on a plain
plank till y'got yer casket."
Most of our contacts told us that the number of times the bell
tolled depended on the age of the person who had died. Ethel Corn,
for example, said, "Quick as the news went that they was dead, why
somebody would go and ring th'bells. And then they'd toll th'bells for
however many years old they were. You could count th'bells a'tollin'
and you'd know just exact how old that person was."
Maude Shope went into even greater detail. "They'd go and ring
th'bell soon as they could—toll it. Like if I was t'die today, however
many years old I was, they'd toll it. You'd go t'countin' if you heard
th'bell toll, and if you knowed they'uz somebody sick in th'neighbor-
hood, you could count th'bells and tell pretty well who it could be."

Annie Perry described the tolling in this manner: "Slow, th'toll
of th'bell would be. Slow. 'Dong, dong, dong, dong'—however old
th'person was."
And Anna Howard said, "They tolled th'bell as many times as they
were years old. If a child were two years old, it was two; 'r if they
were eight'r'twelve'r'twenty—'r just whatever. And fer th'old'uns,
it'd toll fer half an hour. If you could count th'strikes, you'd know
how old they were, and you'd know that somebody had passed away.
Then ever'body'd begin t'try t'learn who it was."
Few of our contacts agreed on the length of time the family waited
before the burying. Florence Brooks said the person was buried two
days after he died. Happy Dowdle said the family would leave the
body out until all the family that was going to be able to come got
there.
Almost all agreed, however, that since there was no way of preserv-
ing the body for any length of time, the service usually took place
with as little delay as possible—often, in fact, the next day. And
washing and dressing the body took place at once. As Mrs. E. H.
Brown said, "Usually we waited till th'next day t'bury'em. Or we'd
wait till th'casket was ready. 'Course we'd go right ahead and get
that dressin' done as early as we could before th'rigor mortis, I
reckon they called it, set in. Y'see, after th'body'd get stiff, it was
awfully hard t'do anything."
We soon became curious about just what it was the family or
friends would do when they laid a body out. Aunt Arie said that it was
essential to work fast or the body would stiffen up and swell. She
talked about hearing arms break "in there" after the body had
stiffened. They would massage the person's cheeks to get the eyes
closed, and then put a silver coin over each eye to keep them shut
since, "lots a'times with homemade fixin' and th'jostlin', they'd come
open.' Silver was preferred because copper might turn the skin
green. In one of the most touching moments that took place in our
interviews, she revealed that when she washed her husband, Ulysses,
before his "buryin'," she found a birthmark that she had never
known was there.
Anna Howard gave us information along the same lines as Aunt
Arie:"When they died, they laid'em out and closed their eyes and
straightened'em. And if their eyes wouldn't stay shut, they'd lay a
nickel on each eye. Then they'd wash'em and dress'em at home. They
didn't have no funeral home t'take'em to."

Mrs. Lex Sanders talked about a man who had had a heart attack
and died: "He was blue—his whole body. They said th'men who
dressed him said he was layin' on his side, and his right side was
perfectly bloodshot. Well now, I'll tell you what they done. Th'old
system was they'd keep a rag layin' over their face wet in soda water.
Then they finally got t'droppin' aspirins in it. It kept their color.
It kept their face from turnin' darker."
Dressing the body, an essential part of a burial many years ago, was
also done by the family and friends. Ada Kelly revealed, "When my
parents were raising their family, they'd usually take the body back
home. They'd dress the body at home and keep it overnight. They
always dressed them in the best they had. Sometimes somebody died
and didn't have decent clothes to be buried in. Then somebody in
the community furnished them—helped out."
Aunt Arie said that shirts were split down the back to get them
on, and she echoed Ada Kelly when she said that her father had to
be buried in one of her husband's shirts because he didn't have any
good ones of his own.
In Anna Howard's community, the preacher would dress the men
("Sunday clothes—their best'uns. A white shirt, tie with a few flowers
down th'middle of it, nice pants."), and the preacher's wife would
dress the women ("in long dresses down to your ankle").
Others of our contacts, as they talked, revealed more and more
variety:
MRS. LESTER NORTON: "My mother's dress was homemade, and I
mean homemade. She already had th'cloth, but they made th'dress
after she died. She told me that th'dress would be all right t'bury her
in if she never did wear it, but we could make it and bury her in it.
So I had that done. And we carried her t'th'graveyard in a wagon—
a two-horse wagon."
MRS. E. H. BROWN: "Women was usually buried in black or white
material—and it was cheap material. It was made accordin' t'th'con-
dition of th'body. Children was usually dressed in white. Th'men was
buried in a suit."
ETHEL CORN: "They'd generally make their clothes. Sometimes
people'ud be buried in th'clothes they had. They'uz generally all
black then. When I'uz just a young'un, they'uz buried in what they
called shrouds. They'd just make a shroud, y'know, and bury'em in
it. They'd choose different colors and make'em. A shroud is similar
t'what y'see these Catholic people wear, y'know—kind of robe-lookin

with belts is what a shroud is. And they buried th'men just in suits.
They wadn't things t'choose from much, and when anybody died,
they'uz generally always buried in black. That was th'main color."
MARGARET NORTON: "They had t'ask for it t'be—if they wanted
t'be buried in blue'r'pink'r'white'r'whatever—and that was fixed for
'em-"
MRS. TOM MCDOWELL : "Sometimes special clothes were made from
cloth donated by friends and neighbors."
And sometimes, in a stroke of individuality, a person would make
the clothes for their own funeral. As Lex Sanders said, "Lord, I've
dressed so many. That was back when they used t'be no undertakers.
They was some people that had their buryin' clothes made for twenty-
five'r'thirty year. They made'em and just put'em back, and of course
I don't guess they was ever ironed'r'put on. But I know that. I know
Granny Bingham had her buryin' clothes made, and she made'em
with her fingers. And they buried her in what she had made. And they
buried Arie Sanders—she wanted her buryin' clothes made. And she
made'em and they buried pore old Arie in what she had made."
Just as there were no funeral parlors, there were also no professional
casket makers. That work, like the preparation of the body, was done
by friends, relatives, or men in the community who did it either for
free, or to earn a portion of their living. Harley Thomas, for example, a
genuine craftsman, was paid about thirty-five dollars. "I've made hun-
dreds of caskets myself. Oh, Lord, yes. Back in th'depression, I made
caskets for the county. They had t'bury a lot of people, and they give
me a job makin' caskets for'em. I had my shop right out there on
th' branch where we had a water mill t'grind corn and stuff. They paid
me t'make'em."
Others charged about five dollars to cover the cost of the handles
and a copper plate on the lid. And many others simply did it as their
contribution to the mourning family. Mr. Mize, the director of a local
funeral parlor, said, "Back in those days, they'd make their own cas-
kets. Neighbors would gather around some carpenters, farmers, and
they'd make the caskets." Mrs. Lester Norton's father made the cas-
kets for her community: "Parker made as many as six caskets for peo-
ple, and he had his lumber all ready to make his when he died. He
already had John Wilburn to make the casket—he had asked him to
make it before he died."
Caskets were made out of poplar, pine, oak, or chestnut. Their
shapes varied widely, but usually they were body-shaped—wide at the

shoulders and narrow at the feet. Ethel Corn remembers seeing some
that had a glass built in through which you could view the body. In
Lex Sanders' younger days, however, they were not as elaborate as any
of the above, being "just simple, square boxes."
Maude Shope remembers that "the lids then, they put so many
screws in it. It sat down flat on top—not bulged up like the caskets
they have now. I don't think they had any divide t'take it off. Th'whole
lid came off as I remember. And they wasn't no glass in it like nowa-
days."
Fidel Crisp talked about his father who made caskets: "My daddy
used t'make coffins when I was a little boy. And he'd make coffins for
anybody that died. And th'size—for a little bitty kid, he'd make it
smaller. And if it was a bigger, grown feller, we'd get his length and
ever'thing and make th'coffin t'fit him. We'd make it out a'lumber."
Ada Kelly's father did the same: "Seemed that he always kept some
lumber put up dry somewhere. And he'd make th'coffin; usually var-
nish it. Make it look right pretty."
Mrs. Lex Sanders told us some interesting facts about coffins for
babies. "Well, now, I've furnished cloth a many a time fer little in-
fants . . . some of'em premature. But they'd make little square boxes,
and then they'd line'em and pad'em with cotton. And then they'd
paint'em black with jet oil—shoe shine'r'shoe polish. Then they lined
th'inside with broadcloth. People used t'be so much poorer than they
are now."
Mrs. Sanders got us thinking about linings, and so we pushed the
point with the rest of our contacts. Ada Kelly remembered the coffins
she had seen as being lined with white cloth. Since it was the most
commonly used cloth in her day, she said that someone always had
some.
Florence Brooks said, "They'd take cotton and white cloth and
bleach it for th'babies and little folks, and for th'older folks, they'd
line it with black material."
Mrs. Don Burnette, on the other hand, said they used satin or white
or blue linen—whatever they could afford, and whatever they pre-
ferred most.
Mrs. E. H. Brown went into still more detail: "They padded the
coffin with cotton, and lined it with what we called plain white silk.
And then they took carpet tacks and tacked that down. It was right
pretty. It was fixed very nice. It wasn't painted; it was covered wJtn
some kind a'black material. My father was buried in a casket like tha •
And my grandfather was buried in one too. But it was his request that

313
his coffin be made out of undressed lumber. He didn't want it dressed,
and so it was made that way. That old man out yonder [pointing to a
picture] made'em. He made nearly ever'body's casket around."
Harley Thomas discussed some other ways to line one: "We lined'em
with white cloth—what y might call linen. Padded'em with shavin's.
Excelsior y'know. Sometimes they'd cover th'coffins in black. They did
lots of'em that way when I was makin'em. They'd just cover'em with
black cloth. They wouldn't even dress th'lumber. They didn't have
nothin' t'dress it with only by hand. I had a plane along then, and I
planed my lumber." He also remembered painting some of them black,
which was a lot easier because then the lumber didn't have to be var-
nished.
Anna Howard remembered the lumber being dressed with an adze
and then covered with a white bleaching. And then sometimes "they
was little things they put on th'coffin—handles, brass. It was brass, and
they were shiny—new, y'know. They had them t'sell in th'stores."
And Ethel Corn added this: "They was all homemade caskets, and
they'd cover and line'em and pack'em. They'd line'em with cloth
they called canebreak, and they'd put cotton sometimes in that. They'd
always line th'inside with white canebreak. That was th'name of
th'cloth. It'uz kind'a satiny lookin'. And they covered th'outside with
black cloth. It'uz th'same for both boys and girls and men and
women."
By the time the casket was delivered at the home of the deceased,
many of the neighbors in the community would have gathered around
those who were mourning. "They'd go spend th'night, y'know," said
Mrs. Tom McDowell. "They'd go set up of a night and sing, and
peopled come in. And when they died, somebody'd go and toll th'bell
at th'church. And that let th'community know. If we'uz workin' in
fields and somebody died, we quit and we went. Tom's grand-
other had a big old sheep horn. And when she died, they got up and
blowed that horn. Now we heard that all around. They blew th'horn
that noon, and when th'horses heard it, they all come in. People
didn't work no more till she was buried."
"The neighbors usually did everything," said Mrs. E. H. Brown,
"Ususally they'd be someone go spend the night with them the first
night. They thought they'd be lonesome or something."
The night following the death, it was customary to have a wake, or a
"settin' up with th'dead." In fact, this is often still done today. When
we asked Fidel Crisp why, he remarked, "Show your respect to

============================================================
PAGE 310
============================================================

314 
FOXFIRE 2
th'dead man is all I know. It's th'respect they have fer you after you
die. And they set up with'im on that account. But now if y'die, they
don't give a damn whether you live or walk."
Mrs. Lex Sanders told us a short story concerning wakes. "There
come an old man t'my house one night t'spend th'night, and died.
And we set up with him about three nights tryin' t'get his people, and
they never did come."
In Mrs. Lester Norton's experience, "Usually a great big bunch
come in and stay till along towards midnight. They usually wouldn't
be but one'r'two left when daylight come. But somebody stayed all
night with'em. And set up with'em."
The following excerpts from various interviews go into even greater
detail:
AUNT ARIE: "Friends would come in, stay all night, bring food.
Twenty-four or thirty stayed at Poppy's [her father]. It was a com-
fort to th'family in case they should need anything. Along about mid-
night, they'd sing some hymns soft. And they'd stay until th'body was
taken to th'church. Now they sit up all night in th'funeral parlor, but
they still stay with th'body."
ANNA HOWARD: "And then you'd have company and sit up all
night. Say th'funeral would be th'next day'r'th'next. They'd just have
ever'body come, y'know, comin' and goin'. Singin'. You had singin'.
They'd sing till they got tired. And ever'body seemed kind and good."
FLORENCE BROOKS : "And they'd lay'em out sometimes on boards
till th'casket got made. And th'people'd come and sit all night and all
day until th'funeral. Sometimes th'whole house was full. They brought
food—nothin' special. Ever'body brought some. They'd sit up all night
and sing until th'funeral. Th'night that Howard died, they'uz so many
in th'house you could stand in th'corner and sleep."
MRS. E. H. BROWN: "We called it 'sittin' up with th'corpse.' I re-
member I stayed at a place one time—me an' two more girls—we
were young. And th'mother'd passed away. About midnight, they
came in with th'coffin, and me and those girls put th'clothes on that
old lady. And th'men folks picked her up and laid her in th'coffin. And
she was put away th'next day. They got her in a wagon."
The next morning, the casket would be put into a wagon and hauled
to the church. Ethel Corn related what happened at this point: "As
they'd come up to th'church with th'corpse, they'd start ringin
th'bell, and th'organ would start playin'."
Maude Shope added, "They rung it just a slow ring when th'corpse
came in sight. I don't know if it stopped when th'corpse wagon finally
got stopped, or whether we'd take th'corpse in th'church first."

Anna Howard answered that confusion by saying, "They'd be tollin'
that bell and a'raddlin" it on till they got in th'church."
Our contacts agreed almost unanimously that the body was carried
the church in a steer wagon—either one belonging to the family or
some neighbors. If steers weren't available, mules were used.
Thev usually wore black to the service, and though the profusion of
flowers common now was rarely seen, sometimes women were buried
with flowers in their hands. The services were sometimes held in the
homes first, but more often they were held at the church, and some of
the men in the community would have already gotten together in ad-
vance to help dig the grave. All would be ready.
The services were usually simple, lasting between a half hour and an
hour, after which the body was viewed one last time, and then carried
to the grave.
As Anna Howard said, "The preacher was all there, and there was
two men who seated ever'body. They'd take it up there and set th'cas-
ket right there before th'pulpit, and th'preacher was a'settin' up there.
Sometimes, if th'person was old, the service was long. And if they
wasn't, it'ud be short. Th'preacher'ud read a chapter in th'Bible, and
then he'd pray. Ever'body went up and looked at th'coffin. And they
had a nice white silk rail—it would be a great big thing—cover from
here down t'here. They'd cover th'face. And th'one who made th'cas-
ket took it off and opened th'casket. The people would look at th'cas-
ket and then go on out. They'd bring th'family last. And then they'd
take and close it up and they'd take it out, and ever'body'd follow it
to th'cemetery."
Maude Shope said, "They opened th'coffin at th'church, and
th neighbors, they went around and looked first at th'corpse. And
th' family come around last. Th'closest relation was th'last one t'come
around t'see'em. If you was a brother and I'uz his mother, well you'd
go first and I'd come around th'last one t'see'im. Then they'd
close'em up and take'em th'way they do now.
"And all children went. Children that'uz not big enough t'look into
th' coffin. 
they'd pick'em up and say, 'That's Grandma,' or, 'That's
Grandpa.' if one o'your neighbor's children died, somebody'd take
care a her children and take'em around and show'em."
Digging 
and filling in the grave was a sacred act that was often re-
served for friends and neighbors who were close to the family. Ada
Kelley verified this by saying. 
"Friends dug the grave and filled it up af-
terwards. And some do here now. [On several recent occasions when
studentswhoattended ourschool havedied, our principal hai helped

"And then when they laid'im down, they'd put all of his things in
there. And I don't remember what they said. Then they made a link
around th'grave—a chain like, y'know. And of course it'uz'a password
of some kind that they passed from one to th'other till it went plumb
around. Then they read over'im, and then they started out th'first one
th'highest rank one. And each one'ud say, 'Ashes to ashes, dust to
dust, sleep all night here, brother.' And they'd throw just one shovel
a dirt. And that went around all th'way thataway till they completely
covered him up.
'They say if you belonged to th'Masons—a man that belonged to
Masons—if he died, the Masons would look after his family, and
they would get them money to live off of. They'd take care of'em. And
they' d help th'people of th'community that was in need a'help that
they knowed of. And they's nobody ever tell what their secrets is.
"Like th'Woodmans, now. Th'Woodmans was a lodge, y'know, that
they could belong to. And you never could get kicked out, but it costed
so much to belong to it. But then when they died, or sickness come up,
they'uz money put in t'keep th'family goin'. But I stole Uncle Bill's
book. I knew where he kep' it. I'uz just a chunk of a girl, but I wanted
t'know that password s'bad, y'know. And I got it and I tried t'read it,
and I couldn't read it ner understand a thing about it. It'uz all mum-
ble-jumble t'me. I never did let'im know I did it."

with the grave.] They used t'be a bunch a'men had tools, shovels, and
ever'thing that they needed t'dig graves. And some one person usually
had charge of those tools. Different ones in th'community would dig
th'grave. It was always very sacred. It'uz just a custom."
Mrs. Lester Norton also agreed, saying, "They'd always be plenty
there t'dig th'grave and look after that. They didn't have anybody spe-
cial back in them times. Just neighbors."
Florence Brooks added, "They'd just carry th'casket up t'th'ceme-
tery, and they'd have th'grave already dug. All th'neighbors helped dig
it. They'uz a lot a'difference back then. Seemed like people had better
feelin's for other people than they do now. Now they don't care u
y'set up by yourself all night or not."
One fascinating account of a funeral came from Ethel Corn. "I was
at one Mason funeral. Uncle Tommy Vinson, he'uz a preacher. He
belonged to th'Masons, and they buried him over here on this hill
above Earl Vinson's. And I went to it, and th'Masons buried him.
And it'uz'a beautiful funeral to be at. And they had th'flags and
things. And as they brought him out, they arched th'flags out over
th'door 'fore they come out at th'edge of th'porch.

============================================================

When the service was over, people from the community often went
with members of the family to stay a day or two. As Ada Kelly said,
"Not ever'body, but close relatives—close friends—somebody like that.
Oh, it affected everyone. We'uz close t'ever'body that died. And even-
family, nearly, had deaths. 'Course, ever'body dies sometime."
Soon after the funeral, a tombstone would be set up. Often it was a
simple, rather crude, but honest affair. Ada continued, "They usually
carved out a rock—nearly always somebody in th'community that did
those kind a'things. They'd smooth up a rock and make tombstones
out of a rock—just out of the rock here in the country. They didn't
charge anything. Ever'body did things for the other fellow then."
And sometimes the markers were of wood [some of which still sur-
vive in this county today]. Anna Howard confirmed it: "The children
would bring his horse up, and him and his wife would ride off to-
gether. Then you heaped the grave up and padded it hard. And then
they'd put up—sometimes it would be a gray rock—sort of soft. Then
they'd write on that their name and the date they died.
"And some just put up a plank and marked on it in big letters"
(Plate 349).
In an effort to find out if the burial customs were any different in the
black community in this area, we interviewed one of our favorite sources,
Beulah Perry. We found that in many ways, their way was identical to
that of the white community. Again, there were no funeral parlors, and
so the burying usually took place the next day. In addition, the burying
clothes were often made for the occasion, they were of whatever colors
the people chose, there would be a wake to which people would come
and stay all night and sing and pray, the coffins were often homemade,
the lumber was left rough and often covered with cloth at the church,
the coffins were often padded with cotton, neighbors dug the grave and
filled it in, and so on.
But there were differences, as the following excerpts from our inter-
view with Beulah show.
On care of the body: "We just kep" th'body in a cool place like on a
porch or in a back room where there's no heat. You see, you couldn t
keep th'body after they were dead where there's heat, so they'd keep
th'body in a cool place."

On tolling the bells: "Not in th'country 'cause you wadn't that close
to a church in th'country. But now in towns they would. Somebody
would toll th'bell, and it didn't make any difference what time they
died that night; why, somebody'd go an' toll th'bells maybe about
two'r'three times, and you'd know. You'd say, 'Oh, they must be some-
body dead. I hear th'church bells.' But I don't guess th'church bell
was ever tolled [where we lived] 'cause people was always so far out in
th'country. Lot a'times it was as far as from here t'Mountain City
[about seven miles] to a church. Very seldom you was real close to a
church."
The funeral procession: "Most people walked, and a lot of'em
would go on [early] to be there because such few peoples in those
days had ways t'ride. Some people'd ride with th'wagon, but th'ones
that'd walk'd go on early and be there."
On viewing the body as part of the funeral service: "After I got t'be
a big girl, they passed a law that you couldn't open a [look at] body
any more if th'body hadn't been embalmed. They passed a law that
you couldn't open a body—but then, seemed t'me like real early too.
Because I do remember, and I was very small then, when we'd go to a
funeral, and we'd wonder why we couldn't look at th'bodies. I remem-
ber they said that th'law wouldn't let you open th'body if it hadn't
been embalmed."
On what took place after the funeral: "Th'next day they'd go and
clean up and wash yer things and put out th'beds—sun an' air an'
disinfect. Y'know, back in those days, peoples was very particular
about cleanin' up after someone died'r'had a long sick spell. They
would go an' clean up with all kind a'disinfect. And back in those
days, they had lots a'lye soap, and they'd just wash and scrub up
ever'thing. And scald th'bed th'person lied on. They were more
particular back then about things like that, I believe, then they are
now. Y'see, all th'sickness was at home, and then after that person
died, they was very particular t'get ever'thing just as quick as they
could washed and boiled. Had them great big pots out in th'yard.
and ever'thing that could be boiled was boiled. And they'd even scald
th'walls of th'room where th'sick lie. Most ever'body had large
families, and they had two'r'three big pots, and if they didn't have
pots, they had big tin cans—you buy'em at th'store, I reckon. And
they'd just put'em on th'rocks and pile wood around'em and get those
pots boilin'. Just th'time one would be empty, you'd fill up another
one until that room was scalded. Walls'n ever'thing. Even th'bed.'
On clothing: "The womens would wear black, and th'mens would
wear th'black bands 'round their arms on their coat sleeves. It'uz some

============================================================

OLD-TIME BURIALS 
321
thin' like a chiffon'r'a voile band they wore 'round their arms just
on top of th'coat—pin it on. It was a piece a'crepe a couple a'inches
wide. If they was a teenage daughter, she would wear mournin'—a
black suit to th'funeral and maybe a few weeks'r'a month'r two after.
Youngsters wear white. I think when my mother passed, we all wore
white all of us girls wore white. And if it was th'mother of th'one that
died she'd wear a long veil way down t'here [across her chest]. And
she'd always wear a little veil for maybe four'r'five months."
On flowers: "It depended on what time of year they died whether
they'd have any flowers. Peoples used t'go to th'woods and get some
holly'r'cedar and make wreaths. And, y'know, back in those days,
peoples had a lot a'ribbon they wore. People's children and mens, they
wore a lot a'ribbon things like neckties an' belts an' sashes. Why,
they'd take a lot a'ribbon things and make a nice one. Sometimes
they'd make a cross out a'it."
On superstitions: "I was raised in one a'them old-time Christian
homes, and we didn't hear a'too many fairy tales like y'do now.
Peoples was too religious. They'd think it was silly. My parents taught
me th'real things. We didn't know too many fairy tales. Y'know, back
when I was a child, peoples didn't do them type a'things. But now
after I got on up in th'teenage, people began t'get stories, and they had
several sayin's: a black cat crossed th'street, you'uz gonna have bad
luck, or you better turn around and all. But nothin' like that back
in my early child days. My peoples didn't believe in those kind a'things,
and they didn't teach it. Now my grandfather would tell us that if
you go out at night and see a light, t'not watch that light because if
y'did, that light would draw y', and you'd just walk and wander and
follow that light and you never would get to it. Now I remember that
cause we all used t'go out in th'yard after night for somethin', and we
wouldn't look at a light for anything."
On death affecting the whole community: "Yes it did. Because
peoples was so close back in those days. Even th'white people. Now
my parents and th'older white people back in those days, they were
close t'gether. They was just th'same as one big family. If they was
anythingthing t'be done, they would just help out like we all was one. Very
close- So much more than we are now."

still does, despite age—he is over eighty—and near blindness. His elo-
quent and moving statements about burial customs seemed to provide a
perfect conclusion to our article.
I really wish that the same burial customs prevailed now as then.
As you indicate, the neighbors would come in during a sickness, and
then in death, and they would lay out the corpse and dress him—get
him ready for burial. And a neighbor carpenter would make the coffin,
and neighbors would dig the grave, and the coffin would be taken to
the churchyard or cemetery in a farm wagon drawn by horses or
mules. Then the remains would be buried by the minister; sort of a
very simple—and to my way of thinking, more reverent than the
present—practice.
There wasn't any idea of a metal casket or a means of preserving
the remains because, as the scripture says, "Dust thou art, and unto
dust shalt thou return." And I'd much rather think of my body as
just going back to the earth where it came from and fertilizing some
tree or the grass or flowers, than just having a metal box with me
inside preserved like a mummy. We've gotten away from the farm
wagon. We have a hearse now, and a funeral home to look after
things. Instead of the neighbors coming into the home and comforting
the mourners, they go to the funeral home the night before the funeral.
And there are other things connected with our funerals that are of
interest more and more. Many people are turning to cremation. Mostly
it was people from the outside who got it started here. People ask
me, "Do you think cremation is Christian?" I tell them I don't know
of anything against it, except that I don't want to be cremated.
They say, "Well, what about the ashes?"
I say, "Well, when the ashes are ready, I advise somebody to bury
them just as they would the body of somebody departed." The little
church up here is becoming more and more popular, and in several
instances, the people who are left behind have asked that their ashes
be scattered up here at the cemetery. They love the place—it's a nice
place. So I just scatter the ashes instead of burying them.
I had a service for one lady up near Highlands who lived up on
Bear Pen Mountain in the sight of a lovely waterfall called Highland
Fall. She wanted her ashes scattered there in sight of that waterfall
near her home, and so I did just that; and I held a service right
there on the mountain top.
Another change I've noticed is a distortion of emphasis. That is
you go into the funeral parlor and into the church, and there's a

============================================================
PAGE 319
============================================================

OLD-TIME BURIALS 
323
casket, and it's open for people to see if they want to—I don't—
and then banks of flowers all around. Well, the center of attention
ought to be the departed person instead of that. You have it all
dolled up to pretend that he isn't there—just the flowers, the beauti-
ful flowers. When I die, I want the money to be spent for something
to carry on the work that I've been interested in instead of spending
it for flowers. If the flowers are in bloom—and I love wildflowers
, I'd like for the children, or somebody that I've known, to pick
some along the way as they come. Bring them along in their hands.
If the wildflowers are not in bloom, then sprays from the hemlock
trees, or the balsam, or pine. Or, if they're in season, dogwood berries.
Or any other for that matter.
Being an old man, it just strikes me that we have changed the
emphasis for the worst. And in the way of music, I don't want any
mournful songs. Saint Paul says, "Be not sorry for those who are de-
parted." A Christian has hope and looks forward to being with
Christ. The faithful servant of Christ lives on. He doesn't just depart
and wait until the Judgment Day. I like a prayer that is in one of our
services which says, "Oh, Lord, we bless thy holy name for all thy
servants departed this life in thy faith and fear, beseeching thee to
grant them continual growth in thy love and service." That, I think,
is perfectly consistent with the New Testament idea that we're starting
our eternal life here. And if we live that eternal life, which is com-
panionship with Christ, then we don't dread the future.
I like one translation that I ran across a few years ago in a
passage from Saint John's gospel. The commentator gives us this
translation: "If any man observe my saying, he shall not notice this
until eternity." Then he goes on to explain. It's like a man sitting under
a tree reading a book. As he reads, a leaf falls on the page of the book.
And what does he do? Become disturbed? No, he brushes the leaf
off and then goes on reading. And he said that death is like that. It
had no more significance for a Christian than that leaf which falls
on the page.
When I die, I would like Easter hymns sung at my funeral because
they are so joyful. They're hopeful. They reflect our belief in the resur-
rection of the dead. They're not morbid and weeping and depressing.
I have one hymn that I very often repeat. I could sing it, but my
voice Isn't what it might be:
"Now the laborer's task is o'er;
Now the battle days are past;
Now upon the Father's shore
Lands the voyager at last. . ."

robably my earliest memo-
ries are of the times when
the power would go out
and we would have to get down the kerosine lamps. My grandmother
always used these times to the best advantage by telling ghost stories—
or "booger" tales. I don't remember the tales as such, but I can re-
member the lamp that lighted only her face as she recalled the choicest
horrors of her childhood.
That the people of these mountains should have a rich supply of
"haint" tales is not at all surprising. They had conquered the land
—but only in a small area around their doors. No matter how friendly
the woods seemed in daylight, there were noises and mysterious lights
there at night that were hard to ignore if you were out there all
alone.
We tape-recorded the following stories in an attempt to let you
share a singular mountain experience—a night of ghost tales by a
slowly dying fire.

To be absolutely truthful, most of the people we talked with did not
believe in ghosts or witches or anything of the sort. They had either seen
their fears proved false (a white dog, a flapping sheet, natural gas, or
the like), or they simply had never had to have them proved false—they
just never believed. We met many of them in the course of .our wander-
ings. Here are some of the best of their comments.

MRS. E. H. BROWN: Oh, I've heard a number of ghost stories.
They come in here and they went out here and I didn't pay any
'tention. I never have been hainted. I didn't think I'd ever done
anybody any harm that they'd bother me.
I moved t'Highlands and they'uz some people come in tryin' t'tell
me how terrible th'old Methodist Church was haunted there at
Scaly there where I lived. Well, I'uz raised there. I let'em tell their
tales. They said that you just couldn't go in that church at night—
they'uz th'awfullest thing they ever were in there.
I let'em tell their story, and I laughed at'em. I says, "Well,
I've been in that church after dark by myself and I didn't hear a
thing." I said, "I wasn't a bit afraid."
There'uz a boy that'd been murdered that's grew up with me was
buried out there, but I never done th'boy no harm, and I didn't
'spect him t'make any noise and bother me.
And then they thought they would get me. Said, "Just as sure as
you pass th'school house about midnight, you'll see a little girl and
a little boy walkin' that rock walk."
"Well," I said, "I've passed there alone many nights about mid-
night and I never did see anything." That was just a fancy someone
had told. Why, I passed that place numbers of nights. I didn't see
nothin'. I believe most a'that is imagination. I say imagination, or
maybe a guilty conscience. Then you might see somethin'. I wouldn't
be surprised. If you'd done some dirty deed or murdered somebody
or something, why I wouldn't be surprised if they wouldn't imagine
they saw something.
But I never experienced no such thing. Only thing I was ever
afraid of was a dog or a snake.
DANIEL MANOUS: No, I don't think there's anything like that.
Do you? I don't think so. I think that's th'imagination. You think
on a thing till you think it's real.
I used to hear my grandfather tell one about when he'uz a boy.
They'uz a cemetery right close to where he lived, and he could hear
a baby cryin' every night over at th'cemetery.
He'uz scared and didn't know what t'think about it and told one
of th'neighbors. Said, "I heard a baby cry over yonder at th'cemetery
every night. I didn't go about it." Said, "I'm afraid to. Are you afraid
to go over there?"
He said, "No, I'm not afraid to go over there."

Grandpa says, "You come over t'my house tonight. If that baby
cries, if you'll go over there and see what it is, I'll give you ten dollars."
So he came over then that night, y'know, and waited till seven
o'clock. Said, "All right. If you're not 'fraid t'go, now's th'time t'go."
That man just took off and went over there, and they'uz a big
basket sittin' on top a'th'tombstone, and they'uz a baby in it. Little
baby boy. He just went and picked up th'basket, went on back and
took it to him and said, "It's a baby."
He'd been a'hearin' th'baby for several nights he claimed. He kept
that baby and raised it, and it went by th'name a' Billy Tombs—after
th'tombstone. That was actually th'truth. I've heard my grandpa say
that he'd seen th'bov a many a time. Billy Tombs.
The Bible preaches that th'dead don't know anything at all. After
any person dies, why they don't know anything. They don't have any
thoughts, don't know a thing in th'world.
Well, they couldn't come back here. They couldn't come back and
cause trouble and bother th'livin' because they can't get back. They're
dead. They don't know anything.
If you don't believe th'Bible, you just as well not believe nothin'.
If it didn't teach that, y'might have somethin' t'base it on, y'see. But
since they don't know anything, how could they come back? 'Cause
they'd have t'be doin' a little thinkin'r'somethin'r'nother before they
could get back and trouble anybody'r'anything.
They's mediums that say they could talk t'th'dead and all that. I
don't believe that. That's just a evil spirit. Really, I don't believe
in'em. They's nothin' t'base it on. They's no foundation. Cain't build
a house without no foundation. Th'Bible destroys all th'foundation.
If somethin' dies, it's gone—don't know a thing in th'world. You kin
find th'stories, but there ain't no foundation for'em. That's what I call
a myth. Just not reality.
MARY CARPENTER: There's a place over yonder at Jim Branch—
they had been people said they's seen balls of fire big as these old.
timey washpots roll th'road there. I forgot who it was told me that
they'uz comin' there one night and said they was a big ball of fire.
And they said they hit Frank Kelly's field and cut out across through
th'field and wouldn't pass it.
HOYT THOMAS: I had friends treed a possum one night, and said
they seen a ball a'fire that gave enough light till they seen how t'get
that possum out a'that tree.

And then one night last winter we seen a light, but it was a weather
satellite put up in fall that was burnin' up. It just looked like a extrv
moon. It had kind of a purple-like glow around it. Didn't last but a
few minutes till it was gone. Then it trailed off in a cloud of smoke.
And one night it just looked like th'world was afire back in there.
Like a big forest fire, y'know. And it come on around, and at twelve
o'clock it went right square up in th'middle of th'sky and made a
question mark. Just as pretty a question mark as you ever looked
at.
ANNIE PERRY: I don't know nothin' about ghosts. In fact, I never
was brought up t'hear ghost tales. My daddy said not t'tell children
ghost tales. Said it'ud make'em afraid. Well, I'm not afraid, but I tell
you I had a sister that wouldn't open a door an' go out on th'porch
an' get a drink a'water at th'well. She'uz just afraid a'th'dark.
They's no such thing as a haint. It's not a thing in th'world but
imagination. They just imagine they hear these things and they don't
hear'em at all.
Now this is not a hainted tale—this is true. I'uz seven years old
when I started school. Had t'go through these woods over here, and
ever'body thought they'uz haints in th'woods.
And th'neighbors, they had lots a'big old brood sows. And if you
caught a pig'r'made a pig squeal, they'd bite you. And they'd say,
"Now, Annie, don't you get out there on th'side a'th'road (them
pigs'uz on th'side a'th'road), an' go through there or them old sows'll
eat you up."
Well, they had me afraid a'hogs.
I'd have t'go by m'self through those woods over there. I'd look
way out here and way out there. There wouldn't be a thing in
th'world. Directly I saw a thing that looked like a hog. I had t'go by
it and I was skeered. And there wasn't a thing in th'world. Not a thing.
They wasn't a hog within a mile a'there—just some old stumps a'lyin
there. But I guess it looked like a hog t'me. Imagination. That's so now.
They skeered me with hogs. And I'd look way out an' I'd see some-
thin' and I'd make a hog out of it.
Now that's th'way ghost tales get started. Ain't no ghosts.
LAWTON BROOKS: 'Bout two mile and a half out a'Hayesvillc
there kind'a in a bend in th'road is where a man was killed and j u S
shoved out onta this big old white rock by th'side a'th'road. And
died and left blood a'settin' on th'rock. That blood wouldn't wash off.

============================================================

Stayed there a long time. An' ever'body passed through there got
scared, v'know, seein' blood on th'rock where that man just fell out
and died.
'Course people got their nerves up and got scared about it and
thev'd see ghosts. Some of'em said somethin' would be gettin' on
behind their mules or horses an' ride with'em an' spook their animals
an' make'em jump around scaired and crazy like. People was really
scaired t'go by that big white rock 'cause so many people says some-
thin' would get on their animal an' aggravate th'dickens out'a'em.
I was a'courtin' up there, and I had t'come by there. 'Course I
could'a went around, but if I went around it would'a been further
out'a my way, and I decided t'go by it. It was a'rainin' that night,
and I'd just take th'near cut and go down through there.
When I got pretty close t'where that rock was, m'horse got scaired
and wouldn't budge nary an inch. Just bowed right up, front legs
stiff like boards. I teched'im wi'm'spur and he jumped over t'other
side th'road. Took a step'r'two and bowed up again, and I could
feel'im a'shakin' a little even.
'Bout that time I saw somethin' white comin' off th'bank right
down t'where that rock was at and stopped. I thought t'myself,
"You got me!" I just knowed that'd 'bout done me in.
So m'horse, I think he found out before I did what that thing was,
and he just commenced walkin' along and walked right up next t'it.
I got me a match out'a m'coat pocket—they wasn't no things like
flashlights in them days—and I struck me a match, and there set a
big white dog—big old white shepherd dog a'settin' there in a ditch.
And if I'd a'went on and hadn't a'never discovered what that was,
I'd a'always said I seen a ghost. But I found out what it was.
ETHEL CORN: They call them balls'a'fire jack-a'lanterns. It's kind
of a round-lookin' thing, an'hit'U come and they'll play up—they'll go
down low t'th'ground and high up. And they're see'd always over
here on what they call th'Chainey Hill. And some said hit was from
mineral. They's a vein a'minerals goes through there. And they'd rise
and they'd go up, and they're pretty good-sized lights, and they're
playin' all over th'bottoms down below there. And sometimes they'll
go away-y-y up and then back down.
I'd been out a'plowin', and I'uz a'wantin' t'get th'bottom plowed
out. And I plowed—hit was a dusky dark when I got in. And I went
t'put up 'horse and got th'corn and went t'feed her, and right at
of th'stable they was jest a big light rose down right at th'back
of th' stabbles in th'swamp.

============================================================

And hit kept a'goin' higher and higher. I was young—I wadn't
plumb grown—and I was awful cowardly, and I throwed th'corn
through a crack in th'stable—I didn't put it in th'trough—and I run
and I run and I never knowed what it was. I didn't take time t'see how
high it went. I run!
And Andy Burrell'uz goin' up th'branch home one night. It'uz in
th'winter time an' right cold and th'wind'uz a'blowin' right hard; and
it got t'blowin' an'floppin' his tie back over his shoulder. And he never
thought of it bein' his tie, and he run about a quarter mile up
th'mountain till he just give completely out.
And when he did, he found out hit was his tie that'uz a'doin'
th'floppin' and makin' th'rackets. He'uz scared, and he took a hard
race from it!
MINYARD CONNER: This boy that lived way back in th'woods
had t'go hunt his cows ever' evenin'. There was a big tree beside
th'road. He'd drive his cows in there and they'd be somethin' hangin'
down from th'limb up there on th'tree. Couldn't tell what it was.
He said it would just be hangin' there. Just nearly dusk.
And he had some more boy friends that lived pretty close. He told
these other boys about it. They didn't believe him. And he told'em a
certain time of th'evenin' it'ud be hangin' there. Said it wouldn't be
hangin' there when th'sun was shinin'r'anything. It would be right
late of evenin'. He told'em t'come a certain time.
Well, th'night th'boys was t'come, he went up there. He kept
watchin' that limb t'see if anything was a'hangin' there. He'd bet
some money, and he'd lose his money if they wasn't. Well, they wasn't,
so he just decided he'd get out and climb th'tree and hang down
himself.
'Bout that time, here they come around th'curve, y'know. He'uz
a'hangin' down yonder. He'd slipped down on th'limb and he'uz
a'hangin' down there.
Th'boys come up and looked around. Said, "Well, he told th'truth.
But he said there'uz just one. There's two of'em." And that boy kept
turnin' his head around, y'know, and kept turnin' his head around-
He turned around and seen that'un hangin' right beside him! He
just turn loose and here he went! And when he hit th'ground,
th'boys broke and run.
Well, he jumped up and took atter'em. He said, "Wait there, boys-
I'm one of you!"
One said t'th'othcr'n—they was a'runnin' right t'gether said, "What
did he say?"

"He said, 'Wait there, boys. I'm gonna have one of you!"
That's th'way them ghost stories gets started.
WILL ZOELLNER: I didn't think much a'ghosts then. We told a
lot a'tales—pulled off some stunts on people—done lots a'foolishness
around about that.
One time we sent a couple a'girls t'get some water—needed some
water. It was Christmas I think it was. They went out t'th'spring,
and when they got out there, there was two fellas had a bed sheet
wrapped around'em.
Well, th'girls filled their jugs—one of'em had th'jug done full and
th'other had it 'bout nearly full. Th'moon was shinin' just as bright,
and they'uz about four'r'five inches a'snow on th'ground—had been
fer several days. And them fellas just popped out acrost th'spring on
th'other side.
Those girls, they just fell down like dead. By God, I thought we'd
never get'em back t'th'house. We toted'em and ruffed'em around.
Even got a rubbin' doctor from Pine Mountain when they come to.
Gosh, they never played that game n'more. They'uz just scared
t'death. Them girls—I heard their hearts a'beatin', and they groaned
a lettle bit onct' in a while. They'uz just limber as rags!
MARGARET NORTON: They say th'best way t'keep from gettin'
scared when y'hear somethin' is t'find out what it is. Go right on and
find out what it is, and then you'll know. It's usually a animal'r'some-
thin' like that. Maybe a possum in a tree.

here were, however, a surprising number of contacts who had seen, or
whose relatives or close friends had seen, phenomena that were inexpli-
cable to them except in supernatural terms. Most believe unshakably
that haints, boogers, and evil spirits walk the land, and after hearing
their stories, one wonders.
AUNT NORA GARLAND: There was about thirteen couples of us,
and we took a notion to walk out plumb to the Mountain City Blue
Heights Church to a box supper.

============================================================
PAGE 328

332 
FOXFIRE 2
Well, we all were coming, and there was about thirteen couples
I guess, and we started back up th'mountain and in th'dead of winter.
Awful cold, but y'know we were young and didn't care much, and
we were all coupled up together, and me and m'husband; of course—
we weren't married then.
But there was a little girl there. And there was a family that lived
about a mile and a half from th'church back up th'mountain on that
old road, and they was pretty well-to-do people. And I thought strange
about them a'lettin' that child go—them leavin' that child at th'church.
So we started from th'church and this little child—it looked t'be
about four year old and it was barefooted and it had on a white
dress and a little band in it like they use t'make'em, and it had blond
colored hair and curls plumb down t'its shoulders—it walked right
at my heels every step up that mountain.
And I just thought ever' one of th'rest of'em seen it, and I just
thought these well-to-do people had just left this child in church.
Just went off and left it t'sleep there.
It kept right at my heels. It didn't walk at th'side a'my husband.
It walked right at my heels all th'way up that mountain to a branch.
And just before we got t'th'branch, why that child fell down and
spread out its arms thataway and was just as gone as gone ever be.
I said, "Lord have mercy," I said t'my boyfriend. The instant I said
that, there wasn't a thing there a bit more than nothing in this
world.
That's th'reason I believe in ghosts.
I wouldn't have found out such a thing as that if I hadn't see'd
it with my own eyes. But of course I wasn't a bit afraid, y'know,
because they'uz about thirteen couples along in front. But that little'n
had walked right at my heels ever' step up that mountain till we
got t'th'branch, and my mother always said that a ghost wouldn't
cross water.
Her and my father used t'live right on up above there in a house,
and she said every morning there was a naked baby sittin on
th'chimney. She's told us that so many times, but I didn't see that.
I'm just'a'tellin' y'what I see'd. It might have been th'same thing, but
this child was dressed in white. But I wouldn't have thought of a
ghost, and hadn't thought of one, if I hadn't see'd it with my own
eyes.
JIM EDMONDS: When my gran'daddy was a little boy, he had

aunt that died. She run a old-time loom. Worked herself t'death.
She died, and th'old man tore th'loom house down where she
worked. Wanted t'get it out a'th'way. And he was goin' a'courtin'
three weeks after she died—courtin' with another woman. Gran'-
daddy said he heard th'boards a'rattlin' just like th'old loom a'run-
nin'. Heard th'loom a'rattlin'. Said they had a big fire a'goin'—a
big blaze—and she walked up t'th'door.
Th'little baby—her baby—they had t'hold him to keep him from
goin' to her. Kept savin', "There's Mommy! There's Mommy!"
And my mother would tell them witch tales. My mother said that
her grandfather moved from South Carolina to Townes County. He
drunk a lot and weren't scared of nothin'.
They were lookin' for a place t'camp, and they asked this feller.
He said, "Go t'th'second branch. Don't stop at th'first. Can't stay
there. It's hainted."
He said he was goin' t'stay there. Weren't a bit scared. They fixed
their camp, got their supper, and went to bed; but he was up. He
was a'feelin' good. Heard someone comin'—like a wagon. Looked
down and saw it a'comin', and just like a big white sheet over
th'wagon. Just a'rattlin'.
The old man just hollered at it, but it didn't go very far before
he heard it comin' back, so he hollered at it again. He got t'hollerin'
at it and cussin' it—even got out his knife t'cut at it—but you can't
hit'em. That thing faded up and down th'road all night.
Somebody been killed. That's th'reason for it.
And old Billy Jesse claimed he was a witch. Ol'Gran'daddy couldn't
shoot a thing. Somebody put a spell on his gun. He went over to
Billy Jesse t'take th'spell off. He lived in what they call Bitter Mountain
Cove. Told him he wanted him t'take th'spell off him. Somebody had
witched his gun.
So Billy loaded that gun and went t'every corner of th'house and
shot sayin', "Hurrah fer th'Devil!" Run t'every corner and shot—
never did load it but once—hollerin', "Hurrah fer th'Devil!"
Billy then said, "Now, th'next thing you will see will be a great
covey of quail. Now don't you shoot at nothin'. Then th'next thing
you see will be a big buck. You can kill him. Just shoot nothin' else."
Gran'daddy done just like he told him, and here come a big drove
a'birds. He just held still. He went on and there was this big ol'buck.
shot and killed him. Th'spell was off his gun.
There used t'be more ghosts then than now.

LAWRENCE MOFFITT: I heard of ghosts but I never did believe.
But I lived one time down here, I'll tell you that, talkin' about ghosts.
I don't know what that was and never did know.
I moved down t'Maysville, Georgia. The man I rented from said
there'uz a house below there that was hainted—an old house—and
nobody wouldn't go into it.
Well, th'first night I moved into this house (not th'hainted one)
there'uz a racket on th'porch just like you was a'draggin' a big chain.
Well, that would come right on through that house, and there was a
side-box kitchen we called it, on th'far side. Well, that would come
through every night. Never missed a night.
I'd get up and sit on th'hearth, and had a flashlight. Never could
see anything in th'world, but you could hear it just as plain as you
can hear me a'talkin' to you.
Well, I wasn't used t'nothin' like that. I talked t'th'man I rented
from there. I said, "What's th'matter? Is this house hainted? You told
me th'lower one down there yonder was, but is this one too?"
"Well," he said, "I'll tell you. There was a man killed here. You've
probably seen th'stains there on the plank there on th'wall in
th'kitchen."
I said that I had, but I didn't know what it was.
"That's where a man was killed, and ever since, this racket has
come through th'house."
Well, I stayed there six months. There for a week or two, I couldn't
sleep. I was tryin' t'find out what it was. The minute th'light would
come on, that stopped. You didn't hear nothin'. You put that light
out and you'd hear that. It'd come every night at nine o'clock as
long as I stayed there. But I got used t'it. I got t'where it didn't
bother me a bit in th'world.
But now t'start with, if I'd had a way, I'd a'come back home!
OSHIE HOLT DILLARD: Way over in North Carolina somewheres,
they was a Indian cave when Grandpa Harkins was just a young man.
And they thought this Indian went t'th'cave every day—or at least
once a week. And they was a white man which slipped around after
him for three days and nights until he got a chance to shoot him;
and he killed him and got his waybill that was printed on a deer
skin.
And he went up there, come by this old farmer's house and wanted

============================================================
PAGE 331
============================================================

BOOGERS, WITCHES, AND HAINTS 
335
to borrow his mattock. And th'old farmer said, "If you'll wait till I
get my hogs fed, I'll go wi'ya'."
And he said, "I don't want y't'go!"
And th'farmer said, "Well, th'mattock is a'settin' out there under
th'smokehouse shed. You can just go and pick it up." And he said,
"Take good care of it and bring it back. It's all I got."
Said way over in th'evenin' after they got back from church,
th'farmer thought about th'man. Thought he might of found some
gold'r'somethin'. He'uz a'lookin' up through th'field th'way that man
had left that mornin', and said he seen somebody wanderin' around
up there. Said th'farmer went up there and said that man was just
as gray-headed as he could be and didn't have a lick of sense—didn't
even know how t'go home—couldn't even see. Said he went back and
got some help t'carry him home, and th'man lived three days and
three nights and died. He never spoke a word.
Th'farmer wanted t'go back and get his mattock—y'know, th'news
got out all over North Carolina over in there—and he had t'have his
old mattock t'farm with, so he went back up there with a whole bunch
a'people. They said, "We'll dig this mountainside down [looking for
gold]."
He said, "You can dig it down if you want to, but I'm gittin' my
mattock and gittin' out of here."
So they went t'diggin', y'know, and laid their coats off. And it
sounded like ten thousand freight trains comin' off th'bluffs. And they
was a big old locust tree standin' there, and said ever' limb and
th'bark fell off of it. And they run off and left their coats.
Grandpa said nobody had ever been back to it. Now he said that
was th'real truth.
LAWTON BROOKS: Bob Meeks was his name, and he was
a'workin' somewhere in Tennessee over there. He come through by
Benton while they didn't have th'road then, and he had t'come across
that mountain. Now I don't know whether it was Frog Mountain,
whether that was th'name or not. But anyway, there was twenty-two
mile there that there wadn't no houses on it—and steep and twisty,
my Lord.
And it was late in th'night. His wife had a'called him. Some of
his kids got sick, and he had t'come in. And he'uz a comin' along up
that mountain, and he said he come around a curve and he seen
this thing. Said it'uz th'biggest man he ever saw.
The man stepped out of a water ditch by th'sidc of th'road, and

============================================================

============================================================

PLATE 351 Lawton Brooks
said he just leaned over a little, and as he come by he just stepped
on th'runnin' board, reached down, opened th'door, got in, set down,
and looked him over. It was a old Model T, and th'way it was goin'
it didn't make much more time than a man walkin'.
And he said he looked at that thing's hands and that's what
he couldn't figure out. Says hit's fingers, one of em was as long as two
of his'n if they was put together, and as big again around. He said
he had awful big arms, and on top of his hands was just as hairy
plumb on down toward his fingers. His fingers was th'longest he'd
seen on anybody. Must have been ten inches long.
He said he spoke t'him and he never did speak back. He said he
didn't know whether he was gonna do anything t'him or not. He said
he knowed he was big enough. They wadn't nothin' he could'a done
about it. They wadn't no need a'gettin' scared because that man
could'a reached plumb around him one-handed. Big tall man—all
hairy.
Said he had a beard way down, an' face hairy, an' said he was
a kind'a'nasty-lookin' old man. Said he looked as old as th'hills.
Said he never got a sound out'a'him. He could hear him a'gettin'
his breath.
And he said he rode at least three mile with him, and he wondered
if this thing was goin' plumb t'Ducktown with him. An' he was goin'
around another curve, an' said that thing—man, what'ere it was—
he just stepped out. And said he looked back and it'uz just a'standin'
there in th'road.

Said he was th'ungodliest man he ever did see all th'days of his
life. He said people might not believe him, but he said it'uz th'truth.
Now I believe it, 'cause I don't believe Bob'd tell a lie. He was a
man never got excited about nothin'.
And after that man got out, Bob said he just kept drivin' on.
And me and Walter Coleman and George went a'possum huntin'.
Now that's th'only thing ever I did that I never found out what it
was. Now I didn't find out what that was now, I'll be fair with'y'.
We left, and it sounded like somebody a'takin' a fit. Jest like some-
body a'cryin'—hurtin' awful bad. An' it jest commenced when we
walked t'where a dog treed a possum out on th'ridge right on't'th'Hia-
wassee River.
An' we jest went out there t'get a possum, y'know, and when we
went out there, by gosh, we just walked around t'th'end a'this old
big log there—jest got a little bit past it—an' somethin' commenced.
Walter said, "Lawton?" Says, "What in th'world is that?"
An' I said, "I don't know, but," I says, "ain't that a pitiful noise?
That's somebody or somethin'r'nother hurtin'."
So we took our old lantern then and walked around th'log. Plumb
around it. Come back t'th'big old stump there where th'tree had been
sawed off. We looked at th'stump. It wasn't holler. Looked in th'end
of th'log. It wasn't holler. Well, I went up t'side of th'log with m'lan-
tern. Shined th'light along it. Couldn't see no hole in th'log on either
side of it. It still sounded like somebody a'cryin' and moanin' under
th'log.
And we started a little away from th'log to where it sounded like
it was comin' from now, and then it sounded like it'uz right back
there at th'log. And then we'd start off out t'th'log again and it'ud be
comin' from a little away from th'log. And then it commenced
there right there at th'log.
And we never did find out what it was. We left there—I mean,
we left—old George an' Walter an' me. We started off that mountain
away from all that moanin' with nary a possum—into a field (Old
Man Smith's field)—and we run right into a wire fence that we
didn't know was there. Way we went flyin', when we hit that fence
it scared th'daylights out'a us.
That was th'only thing I ever heard I never did find out what it
was. Why, I wasn't skeered s'bad, but I wasn't gonna stay and them
boys run off and leave me! They wouldn't stay wi'me, and I sure
Wasn't gonna' stay up there an' listen t'that thing by m'self.
So we didn't take time t'get any possum!

MRS. MARY CARPENTER: I've heard Mama tell about th'one
my daddy saw one time. Said that there was a preacher, and there
was a forks of a road somewhere near a church I believe it was.
And he said that hit was about ever' evenin' about sundown that
you could go there, and there'uz a woman that—she was so high up
in th'air that she looked like she was on a quilting frame—just high
up. And she had on a long black dress and she'uz just a'walkin' along,
and it rustled like leaves a'rattlin', y'know, as she walked.
My daddy and another man, they worked for Earl Hudson at a
sawmill, and they said they'uz comin' in one night and it was
a'rainin', and they was a'ridin' them mules on in home.
And that man said to my daddy, said, "Fd like t'see that preacher's
ghost tonight, wouldn't you? While it's dark and rainin'?"
Said my daddy said to him, "Well, yonder she comes!"
Said they went on—just kep' a'ridin'—and Papa said to him, "You
ride on one side a'th'road and I'll ride on th'other and let her come
between us, and we'll see what she looks like."
And so they did. They reined th'mules over and let her come
right in between'em. Said he said t'him, "Let's foller and see where
she's a'goin'."
Said it was just a'pourin' th'rain down, and said they turned
th'mules around and followed about a half a mile back out th'road,
and said there was just a curve in th'road—a little ridge. And said
she just riz and flew over that ridge and they didn't ever know where
she went.
Now is that th'kind of haint tale y'want?
Well, all right. Now there's a place down next t'my brother's
that they've seen things down there on that hill. My husband said
they'uz a'goin' out through there one night—him and Lawrence
Talley I believe it was. They'd been t'church up here t'th'Flats to a
Holiness meetin', and they was a'goin' down Mud Creek goin' back
home.
And he said they was goin' up along there, and he said he didn't
know what it was. It didn't say a thing in th'world. But somethin'
just hit them. It was as cold as ice, and he said they just begin
t'shiver and shake.
And he said Lawrence said, "Are you cold?"
And he said he was just about t'freeze t'death, and it was in
thsummertime.
And he said, "Well, I am too." Says, "Seems like there's ice all over
me!"

And John said, "Well, seems th'same thing t'me."
He says, "Let's run."
And John says, "I can't run."
He said, "I don't guess I could either."
And said it just jumped off of'em just like that, whatever it was,
and went away.
He said there's people said they'uz haints out there.
And there at my brother's right across th'creek—you've been over
there on Kelly's Creek up there where Jim Taylor lives—there's a
Mason woman lives over there. She said she'd seen a little baby out
there that was flyin'—had wings. And she said it came up out of her
garden more than once, and she'd be out there on th'back porch
up in th'evenin' doin' her night work, and she said it would rise up
with wings like a little angel—a baby.
And I know she seen somethin' one time, fer because her husband's
[Frank's] daddy lived over on Germany and he was sick—bad sick.
And so Frank—he'd went t'see his daddy. They were lookin' fer him
t'die.
And she had a hog pen out in th'woods there, out toward our
house, and she began t'scream. And Mama hollered t'me t'run over
there fer somethin's th'matter. She may be snakebit.
Well, I went a'runnin' just as hard as I could, and Dad, he went
a'runnin' over there. And you know, she'd fainted 'fore th'time we
got over there.
By th'time we brought her to, she said there was a man there at her
hog pen with a white shirt on and no head! Blood was all over his
white shirt.
Gran'pa said they moved one time—said Mama was a little girl
then. And he said they got moved all but their chickens, and he
had t'go back and catch them after dark.
So he got him some sacks t'put his chickens in and went back
t'th'place he'd moved from and caught his chickens up and tied'em
and put'em in a sack. He was ridin' a mule.
He had some slung across his saddle—some on one side and some
°n th'other—and he was comin' along, and all at once there was
sorncthiii' in th'road. Said it looked like somebody in th'moonlight.
Said he said, "Whoa" t'th'mule. Said "Is anything th'matter?"
And said it looked like a log. Said it started rollin' toward his mule,
and his mule started runnin' back'erds with'im. Said it just rolled
so far and stopped, and it rolled back up th'road.

============================================================

Said he started back up th'road with his mule—back up through
there—and said it'd come back toward him when he'd start.
Said he made two or three trips like that and decided it wasn't
goin' t'get out of th'road and let him by, and said th'mule was afraid
of'im; and so he just laid th'fence down—a rail fence—and let his
mule run through th'pasture and come back out, and laid down
th'fence again, and passed that place.
And Gran'pa said one time him and Uncle Dave was goin' home
from a dance, and as they come around there where a pond was,
why they heard something' a'sayin', "Oh Lordy! Oh Lordy!" Takin'
on pitiful.
Gran'pa said he was scared—and said he was little—and he grabbed
Uncle Dave by th'coat and said, "Dave, don't you run!"
He said "I ain't a'goin' to. I'm goin't'stay here. It's risin', whatever
it is."
And said somethin' come up out of the water with th'moon a'shinin'.
Said you could see it like a white sheet. Said it had four corners, and
it just kept a'goin' on up, and it was just takin' on th'pitifulest. Said
it was sayin', "Oh Lordy! Oh Lordy!"
Gran'pa said that his mother said that what caused that—there was
a miller there and he'd killed his wife and put her in there, but that's
been many many years ago. I don't know. It could have been. Gran'pa,
I believe, told th'truth, 'cause I never did know him t'tell a wrong.
I believe he heard it. I believe there's things for certain people t'see.
When we lived in that old house right down there, they shore
was one down there. Harv Brown owned th'place first, and his wife
was afraid t'stay there.
They'uz goin' t'sell it, so we bought it. And we could hear a horse
down there. Harv was afraid of it too.
At night he'd come, and you could be just as quiet as you want
to, but when you blowed th'lamp out (back then you didn't have
electricity in this part of th'country) you could hear that horse
—and I mean it'd come right up in th'yard just like a feller. You've
heered a feller ride a horse—what a big racket they make—and it'd
stand and stomp till you got up and looked, but when you got up
t'look and shined th'light, there wasn't nothin' there. You didn't hear
any more that night.
But it's th'truth if I ever told it—if I'm a'sittin' in this chair. I've
heard it.

And Gran'pa said one time that he went t'make music one time fer
somebody, and said he broke th'banjer string.
Thev said, "Well, we'll have t'quit. We ain't got another banjer
string."
One of'em said, "John, you run over t'Ken Muse's." Said, "He's
got some banjer strings—some extry ones." Said, "Get one over
there." Said, "It ain't late and we'll play some more."
Said he looked out. Said he wadn't afraid, but he didn't like th'idea
of goin' fer he had a big dog that'd bite—a great big ol'dog—and
said he said, "It's pretty dark out there an' I'm afraid that dog'll
get me."
"No!" he said. "I'll make you a board light." There wadn't such
a thing as a lantern or a light or a flashlight. Said they got him a
pine torch and lit it.
He said, "Now if you'll hurry along," he said—that'uz just a big
ol'pine knot, y'know, and they just keep a'burnin' and a'goin'—said,
"If you won't stay too long and hurry along, it'll last you till you get
there and back."
And so he did. He started out with his pine knot, and said he got
nearly there and somethin' just rared up on him and put his hands up
on his shoulders and pushed him back'erds and blowed his breath in
his face!
Said he reached like that t'push it off and couldn't feel nothin',
and said that he plodded on pretty fast till he got over there, and he
said to him, he said, "Is your dog loose tonight?"
He said, "No. I've got him tied up."
He said, "I thought you kept him tied at night." He said, "Now
you tell me what that was that rared up and like't'pushed me down
out here." And said. "He'uz 'bout as big as yore dog." He said it
was a big thing, "And it put his front feet right up on my shoulders
and like't'shoved me back'erds!"
"No," he said. "It wadn't my dog, John," he said. "Come here
and I'll show you. I chained him tonight."
Said he went around t'th'back of his house to his cellar door, and
that ol'big dog was tied up there. Said he never did know what that
was, but said somethin' shore pushed him back'erds. And said he
had th'light and could have seen if it'd been somethin', but he didn't
see no dog.
And I know another'n. I know one more I'll tell'y.
Gran'pa said that one time they moved t'a place, and Mama

was their baby. Th'old man that owned th'place lived off in an older
house—and his good house, he had it for rent.
Said, "Why do you reckon th'landowner lives in that old house and
rents this good one?"
And [Gran'ma] said, "I don't know."
"Well," he said, "I don't know either, but there's somethin' sorta
fishy to it. Maybe he gets more pay fer th'better house though."
Well, Gran'ma done th'milkin'. She went t'milk that evenin', and
when she started milkin' in th'bucket—you know milk in a tin
bucket'll make a racket—right out from a big rock pile a baby begin
t'cry.
Said that Gran'ma just milked on a little while, and said she just
took her bucket and went t'th'house and told Gran'pa. She said, "I
want you t'come out here and listen." She said, "When I go t'milkin',
there's a baby goes t'cryin' in that rock pile."
"Why, now," he said. "There ain't."
She said, "Come on out here and hear it!"
She poured her milk out t'where it'd make a racket in th'bucket,
and she went back and she started milkin' and th'baby commenced
t'cryin' again.
They talked t'th'man about it, and he said, "Nah. There wadn't
nothin' to it." Said, "People just imagined hearin' things."
And Gran'pa, he was a little bit afraid of it. He stayed on a while
—just milked and let th'baby cry.
Said that some of th'neighbors around there, they got t'talkin' to'im.
Said they didn't nobody ever know what become of that man's wife
and baby. Said he had a baby and a wife and they just disappeared
and nobody ever knowed where they went to.
And Gran'pa said that he didn't know, but he sorta thought they
might be in a rock pile up there. He said, "When y'go t'milkin',
th'baby goes t'cryin' out there."
A bunch gathered up t'gether out there, and they went t'milkin',
and th'baby cried. They moved a big pile'a rocks and dug down
there, and he had—he killed his wife and baby and buried'em there
and piled rocks on'em.
Gran'pa and Gran'ma, they moved away from there. But that's
why that man couldn't live in th'house. I reckon they'd come back
t'him in th'good house there.
ALEX JUSTICE: One night we just wanted t'camp out, and we
saw haints all night. All night. 'Long about ten o'clock I guess it was

th'wheat mill was down there and they'uz a old sawmill down there
somebody come ridin' a mule up, and somebody come right up
t'th'bridge, y'know.
We run out there, and it was gone as quick as we got there.
Then along about four o'clock, there was a yoke of cattle—
yoke of steers come down th'road hitched to a sled. They'd get
'bout as close from here t'th'porch there. We saw it all. We'uz just
bovs. It did scare us. There'uz big old white dogs just a'trottin' along,
and a man—he had on a white shirt and didn't have no head. Chains
a'rattlin'. Then it'ud go away, and then it'ud rise up again. Just a
bit down below us—and here it'd come. We'd grab corn stalks and
run out there, and there wadn't nothin' there.
Then I saw a sled with a load a'wood on it comin' down th'road,
and they wadn't nothin' pullin' it. I could see th'standards on th'sled,
I could.
And once my wife was sick—we'd had a dead baby and been
t'bury it that day. There'uz snow on th'ground, and somebody come
up on th'porch and knocked on th'door.
And old Aunt Katherine Adams was there, and I told some of
th'boys that worked with me, I said, "Open th'door."
And Miss Adams said, "They ain't nobody there."
It just walked up and knocked on th'door just as plain as anybody
was there, but they wadn't nobody there.
She told me, she said, "That ain't th'first time!"
CALVIN TALLEY: Back when I was a young boy—I guess I was
about ten year old—I was headed t'church one evenin', and I rode
down th'highway with my brother.
And we got out and I started walkin' up toward th'church, and all
of a sudden a somethin'—there was somethin' that come around from
th side a'this old building. And it was kindly dressed in white, and I
couldn't hardly make it out. I had always heered that this old build-
ing had ghosts, and I couldn't really understand what it was, but it
made me pick up speed!
MYRTLE LAMB: Well, it was up near Sunburst, North Carolina. It
was a house nobody wouldn't live in. Ever'body would get scared, and
you would hear all kinds a'rackets.
They said a girl had a baby, and said she didn't want it so she took it
and fed it to th'dogs- or hogs—and when it rained, on a cloudy
night, you could hear that baby cry just as plain.

Then in th'house you'd hear all kinds of things—like stockings rub-
bin' against th'wall. My mother said ever' night somethin' would come
and kick th'cover off her. And she would git up and sit up scared
t'death, and this other woman got afraid and come and stayed with
her and'ud sit and dip her snuff and talk and go on.
MRS. R. L. ELIOTT: Well my mother, y'see, she was raised in a
house 'at was haunted. She said ever' rainy night that there was al-
ways noise to be heard.
And her daddy would send'em out, y'know, 'cause a lot of nights
would be like hogs under th'floor; and he'd send'em out with lanterns,
and they couldn't see nothin'—but they could hear it. It was just like
hogs. And when you'd get around there, why you wouldn't see nothin'.
They'd just hear this noise.
And then maybe a night'r'two later it'd go like horses, y'know—jest
different noises all th'time.
And her daddy was just kept a'runnin' all th'time. They'd go just
like a big bunch a'hogs under th'house—rootin', y'know how they'll
do. I don't believe you can see a spirit. I think you can just hear'em.
And where anybody is killed, there's always a noise t'be heard.
That's really true. Now I've experienced a lot of that myself, and I
know that is true. I've been around a lot of these places, y'know, where
people has been killed.
I've lived up here at th'hotel where Mr. Ramey was killed. One
night I was up there. I was out alone—jest me an'm'son—and we
heard a bunch a'people comin' down th'highway a'cryin'. Moon was
shinin' jest as bright as day. And I stood out and listened—kept lis-
tenin'—and they kept comin' closer and closer, an' come on up
t'th'house. Seemed like th'sound jest went around th'house, but I never
did see nobody. But it went like a whole bunch a'people.
So I jest went in th'house. I got scared an' went in th'house,
y'know, and locked th'door.
Then one night across th'road from my house it looked like a little
calf out on th'side of th'road jest playin' around, y'know. And they
shot at it an'ever'thing, and it jest kept dancin' right on—playin
around—and they never could hit it'r'nothin'. Jest a spirit, y'know.
Mr. 
and his wife, they saw it too. We all saw it. Th'moon was
shinin', and hit was jest across th'road there. It was jest playin' over
there jest like a newborn calf. It'uz jest a spirit of some kind.
And my uncle, he said he lived in a house over yonder, an' after his

mother died, one night him and his brother was in th'bed and some-
thin woke him up a'chokin' him. And he said he tried ever' way t'get
his brother awake and couldn't get him awake, and he lit th'lamp.
And he said when he lit th'lamp, it looked like a big animal that had
black hair. And it was a big ol'animal. And he said it made another
dive at his throat, y'know, t'choke him again.
He never did get his brother awake, but he follered this thang in
th'front room, and he said then that thang went up jest like a
ball'a'fire through th'top a'th'house.
You see, that was a spirit. That wasn't nobody. It went up through
th'top a'th'house right there in th'room where his mother'd died.
They's been a lot a'things seen, and I believe in ghosts.
Now up here right above Rob Williams' they's a house there where
a old man poisoned his wife. They's always thangs t'be see'd there. My
mother saw a man with no head on there.
We used t'go up there an' play. They had a downstairs and a up-
stairs in it. And we—a bunch of us children—was upstairs playin', and
they'uz a baby cried downstairs—cried just like a real baby. So we
tore th'top out an' come out th'top a'that house!
And one night my aunt was comin' up t'our house and this big
ol'thang caught her in th'road and choked her like a bear. Well, hit'ud
sleep on that porch at night. They could hear it lay down on that
porch. But they never did know what it was. And her husband's
brother hit it with a axe handle one night, and hit jumped back across
th'fence, but they never did see what it was. It was a big thang like a
bear.
So I've always believed in'em m'self.
And at Miss Maggie's house they's always a noise to be heard there
at some time. She lived there for years and years, an' she'd tell us lots
a times about bumblebees in th'winter time. You never hear bumble-
bees in th'winter time, but she'd hear'em swarmin' in th'house,
y'know.
And my uncle lived in a place where some nights it would go like
ever' dish in th'cupboard would fall out. Said he'd get up and look,
and ever'thang was just like it was. Said maybe th'next night it'd go
like somebody poured out a bushel a'corn right on th'floor, and it
Wouldn't be a thang.
Now up on th'mountain, my grandfather killed a man. They was
both drunk, and he killed him up on th'mountain. They got t'fightin'
somc way over a still that was cut down on his place, and he cut his

FOXFIRE 2
head off and laid it up on a stump—cut it plumb off an' laid it up on
a stump—and then he served twenty years in prison.
Well he got rich in prison. He waited on a train robber, an' he
brought back—I don't know at th'money.
But on that mountain you can pass that stump an' you can hear
things of a night. Anybody on a rainy night, if they want t'hear'em,
ought just t'walk down that road an' they can hear'em.
I took my baby up on th'mountain one time an' was comin' back—
bringin' him in a little ol'carriage. Just as I got even with that place I
heard a singin'. You never did hear such a racket. An' bov I drove
him off that mountain in a hurry. I brought that carriage down
th'road—I got away from that place. I was scared teetotally to death!
MRS. ARDILLA GRANT: I seen'em with m'own eyes. 'Course
th'woman that was with me is dead. I couldn't bring y't'her, but if she
was alive I could. But they's a house at Hewitts—I guess you've
heared tell of there in North Carolina—there's a big house they call
th'white house up there, and ever'body that stayed there would hear
somethin', 'r hear somethin' say somethin'.
Well, one night we went out there on th'end of th'porch, and
th'lights was shinin' out th'windas, y'know; and they'uz a barn out
yonder. Great big oFbarn they had.
We'uz out there on th'porch, an' this ol'lady, she come out from un-
der that barn now. I'm tellin' y'th'truth exactly th'way we seen it.
Well, I didn't say a word, nor she didn't either. We watched her till
she just came up close t'us, an' she had her hands out like that [Mrs.
Grant puts her arms out like a sleepwalker in front of her], and she'uz
just as quiet an'th'purtiest thing. She was old, y'know, and she had her
hands out like that, an' she came up close. And this woman that was
with me, she said, "Lord, child, do you see that?"
And we run back in th'house an' we told th'men—it was a boardin'
house then—an' we told th'men what we saw, an' they got up and
went out on th'porch. They thought maybe someone had stopped out
at that barn t'camp out'r'somethin'. But they didn't find nobody. Not
a sign of anybody. No tracks nor nothin'. Now that did scare us!
And then down below there—what they call th'Mud Cut—there's a
curve in th'road, and a railroad went aroun' down there. An' down
below there you could see a man—his legs and a lantern. Y'could see
th'lantern an' his legs; an' he'd come up on that railroad an' he'd
walk down that railroad t'th'top of th'grade they called it; an' he'd
just get out'a'sight till he'd pop up right in th'same place.

That starts about nine o'clock, and I'll bet you go right up there to-
night at nine o'clock an' see th'very sight. He'd go along and disappear
a n' start right back where he started from. He'd just keep a'goin',
v'know. You could see th'lantern swingin', and his legs, and right back
down th'railroad he'd go.
Now lots'a'people seen that. Now it must a'been in time—some
timeYnother—they'd been somebody murdered there.
[At this point Mr. Grant said that he had heard that a Bill
McCathey had killed his brother there by mistake, thinking he was a
groundhog.]
Then on up th'road they was a second house that th'railroad men
boarded at, y'know. Now I didn't hear that. This is what they told me;
but now they told it, an' I think it was true: somebody—just went like
somebody'd come in an' thrown down a load a'lumber an' got t'ham-
merin'. Just like he was makin' a coffin.
Well, it just worried somebody that lived there. It was that way con-
tinually. An' it sounded like it was in th'wall, y'know, at times.
An' he went an' tore th'ceiling off and he found a little baby skele-
ton in there!
JUD CARPENTER: One night I was passin' along, th'moon
a'shinin' pretty bright. It'uz along about ten o'clock at night.
Directly I heard somethin' come scra-a-a-a-pin' along behind me. I
turned around and looked around. 'Bout that time that thing hit me
right in th'bend of th'legs. Felt just like a old dry cow hide.
I danced away, but couldn't see a thing. I stood around there a
while, kept lookin' around, but never did see nothin'.
Finally I just walked off'n'left it. Never did find out what it was.
And we used t'live in old John Sanders' house there. They'uz a
winder there at th'chimbly end—right next t'th'chimbly. And they'uz
somethin' ever'night'r'two would come there at th'winder and moan
an' groan an' make funny rackets.
One night it climbed up in th'winder—th'winder was made out
a planks, y'know. He just come up there on that winder an' scratched
and went on an' kept jumpin'n'scratchin'.
After while, my daddy decided he'd get up and see what it was.
When he got out there, it vanished away—couldn't see nothin'.
They said they'uz a man killed in there—claimed it was hainted.
They was right.
And I passed along by th'Methodist church one time. It was 'bout

eleven'r'twelve o'clock in th'night, but th'moon'uz shinin', and
th'church doors happened t'be open.
So I heard somethin' runnin'n'jumpin' across th'benches in there
an' makin' th'awfullest racket I ever heered.
I didn't have no light a'no kind'r'nothin', but I went on in'ere—
went plumb back in th'back a'th'church. That racket disappeared
then and I couldn't see nothin'—couldn't see a thing in th'world, and
th'moon'uz a'shinin' in at th'doors an'through th'winders too, so I
could see pretty well.
So I walked on down th'road a piece, an' directly I heard a li'l
racket behind me. I just turned around and looked. It'uz just like
somethin' a'draggin' a little old sheep skin'r'somethin'. But I never
could see a thing.
HILLARD GREEN: Ghosts are just th'Devil after somebody, and
they're seein' these things for some lowdown meanness that they've
done. It's in their eyes and in their mind is what it is. People will see
things where they ain't nothin'. A ghost is a spirit or something that
comes t'somebody that they've done evil to—harmed them some
way'r'other. Maybe killed somebody.
They're things that way that can be seen and heard, y'know.
Th'Bible speaks about these ghosts and witches and so on. You may
not believe in a witch, but they are, for th'Bible tells us.
I've heard of'em. I've seen'cm. I've seen people that could witch.
They can do just anything they want to.
Now I've seen an old woman down on Cowee where I lived, and
I know she was a witch. Alan, down there, he wanted t'go and plow
somebody's garden, and his mother said, "No, you're not a'gonna
plow that garden." Says, "You're gonna plow mine first or you won't
plow nobody's."
And he said, "I'm a'gonna plow over there and then I'll plow for
you."
She says, "You'll not do it."
And he went out there t'get his old steer t'go plowin'. You know,
that steer just fell over like he'uz dead nearly. And he lay there three
days and he never eat a bite ner nothin'.
Well, Alan took on about his steer, and he tried t'doctor it and
ever'thing and finally at last he says, "I'm gonna have t'kill that steer
t'get him out a'my way."
His mammy says, "Oh, you don't have t'do that. I can go out there
and lay my hand on him and that steer'U get up if you'll go out there
and plow my garden. "

He says, "Well, Ma, I'll plow it then."
She just walked out there t'that steer and laid her hand on it, and
that steer jumped up just th'same as there wasn't a thing in God's
world th'matter with it.
I've seen a lot of things that she done, and I know she could do any-
thing in th'world she wanted to that way t'destroy you. That was forty-
seven years ago when that happened. I'uz livin' right close t'them.
I seen her get mad one time and witch a baby, by gosh, till it died
'cause she got mad at th'parents. There's somethin' to it. You don't
know when it comes t'their power.
Be like old Mrs. 
over here was. Lived right over here across
th'ridge over here. She got her a book and was goin't'learn how
t'witch.
And somebody come t'her, y'know. Told her where t'go to out there
on th'ridge and set down on that log and then they'd come and learn
her.
Well, when they come to her, they said, "Now you put one hand un-
der your foot and one on top of your head and say, 'All th'rest belongs
t'th'Devil.'"
She said that she couldn't do that at all. They'uz somebody standin'
there but she didn't know who it was. And she said, "All that belongs
t'God-a'-mighty." And that person was gone and she didn't see no-
body and didn't know nothin'. She just got up and went t'th'house
and throwed her book away.
A spirit can appear to you any time that way if you'll serve
th'Devil.
In addition to the retellings of personal or interfamily experiences, we
were also told a number of pure ghost tales—tales that have been told
and retold throughout the Appalachians for years. They are a part of a
rich oral mountain tradition. And they're also among the wildest stories
we've ever heard.
ETHEL CORN: There's an old tale told; I don't know who it was,
but said there was this hitchhiker. He wanted a place to stay all
night, and they told him that he could stay in that house, but it was
hai|nted. He said he didn't believe in'em. There weren't no such thing
an'he'd stay in there.
Later on he heard cats around, an' this cat with no head jumps up

on th'bed. That feller, he jumped out of th'bed an' he started t'run-
nin' t'get away from it.
Said he run down th'road till he give out—till he thought he was
fer enough away that there wouldn't be nothin' around. He'd sit down
t'rest, and said that directly somethin' said, "We've had a hell of a
race, ain't we?"
He turned around an' there set th'no-headed cat by him!
GRADY WALDROOP: Man said, "I got a house over there on
th'edge a'town. You can stay in there all night—all winter if y'want to.
Won't cost a dime. There's plenty a'wood, books an'ever'thing in
there." Says, "I'll tell y'th'reason it's thataway." Says, "Ever'body
that's ever stayed there says it's hainted." Says, "There's a ghost
comes in there an' they all afraid a'it."
"Aw," he says. "I don't care nothin' about that. I won't be afraid-
'r'nothin'. I'll just go over there. May stay a day'r'two."
He went over an' fixed him some coffee an' lunch an' ate it. Got a
book and'uz settin' readin' when a big ol'cat come down an' went up
an' wallered in th'fire an' says, "Don't know what t'do about attackin'
y'now." Said, "I reckon I'll wait till Martin come."
Said he didn't like that much. Said he got him another book.
Directly here come another'n down th'steps. Big ol'angoran cat.
Said he got under th'forestick an' rambled around an' knocked fire
all over th'place, an' he kicked th'fire back'n said, "Y'wanna com-
mence on'im now or wait till Martin gets here?"
"Well," [the man] says, "I don't know when Martin'll get here,
but when he comes, you tell him I've been here and gone!"
JIM EDMONDS: There was a man one time—had a lot of money,
all silver. Had no greenbacks then. Had about half a bushel of silver—
sold his place out, y'know, an' was goin' t'go out west—out of
th'country. So he was gettin' ever'thing ready. Had his money he got
from th'place, y'know.
So he got this feller t'come and give him a shave as he was gettin'
all fixed up and ready t'go. Well, th'feller got him half shaved, an'
then he took th'razor and cut his throat an' killed'im. But th'feller
couldn't find th'money 'cause th'guy had it buried.
Well, they find this guy dead. They didn't know what happened
ner nothin'. Somebody killed'im, but they didn't know who did.
When people way back then would start t'go from one country
t'another an' they didn't have a place t'stay, they would just go on
an' find a empty house. Some folks came drivin' by one day lookin' fer

a place and asked a feller about it. He said, "I got a place down there.
Can't nobody live down there. Tell what I'll do. If you live in that
house fer twelve months, I'll give it t'you. Can't nobody live down
there. Don't know whether you can stand it'r'not. You can move in
th'house if y'want and live there."
They just had one child, y'know. Th'little feller, they just laid'im
on th'bed. Th'old man, he was out workin' around gettin' wood and
fixin' up—goin' t'stay all night. Th'woman, she was a'fixin' supper,
and here come a man runnin' in with his head half cut off and a
razor in his hand startin' like he was a'goin' t'th'bedroom.
That woman was scared t'death and said, "Lord have mercy;
don't kill my baby!"
He just stopped right quick and said, "Fine thing you spoke t'me.
Tell you what I've come fer. I want you t'do somethin'. You do what
I tell you."
He told her th'man's name that cut his head off. Said, "I was
fixin' t'leave here and he cut my head off t'get th'money. Tell what I
want you t'do. You go and swear out a warrant for that man and get
him to come to court for a trial. You don't need no witnesses. Don't
need no witnesses. You just have him come to court. You'll have a
witness. And I'll tell you what I'm goin' t'do. You'll have some
money. You come and foller me."
He just went down a little ways t'where a big rock was a'layin'
there. Said to move that rock, but th'woman said she couldn't. But he
said, "Yes you can."
So she reached down and that rock just turned over real easy and
there was all that money down there where he had dug th'hole. He
said, "Now you get all that. That's yours. You do what I tell you—you
have a trial and have him come t'court, and when you get ready t'have
a witness, you'll have a witness."
She went ahead and had that man arrested—got that man and
told him what he was guilty of. People didn't understand at all.
Th'judge asked him what he was charged with. "Murder," he replied.
Th'judge then asked him if he was guilty or not guilty. About that
time, here come that feller walkin' in th'courtroom with th'razor in
his hand and his face half shaved and his head half cut off.
When that man saw him, he just tumbled over dead!
MRS. MARY CARPENTER: There'uz a man one time—him and
his wife was a'travelin' along, and he said they went t'a house and
they went in. Said that it was a'rainin' and they was a'goin' t'stay all
night.

============================================================

And he told her t'stay in th'house—light a lamp and stay—and
he'd go t'th'field and see this man and see if he cares if they stay all
night in his house.
Said she went in and scrambled around and found some matches
and lit th'lamp. Th'house had furniture in it. Said there was a Bible
layin' there on th'table and she just opened it up and set there by
th'lamp and was a'readin'. She just kept a'settin' there waitin' fer
him t'come back. Said it was rainin' harder, y'know. She thought that
when it slacks he'll come back.
Her husband went over in th'field and they told him th'house was
hainted and that you couldn't stay there.
She just kept a'settin' there, and directly a great big drop a'blood
just hit th'Bible there and just splattered out on it.
She looked up and didn't see anything. She just read on. Pushed
her book up a little and read down below it.
Another drop dropped on it.
Said she just set there and read on till th'third drop dropped. When
th'third drop dropped down, said she heard somethin' a'comin' down
th'stairs and she just looked around. This haint, he just set there and
said, "Well, you've been th'only person that's ever stayed here when I
come back."
"Well," she asked him—however it was to ask him—"Well, what
do you want? Why did you come back?"
Said he was killed fer his money there but they didn't get it. He
said that they'uz a fireplace in th'kitchen, and they killed him and
buried him under th'hearth rock. He said his bones was under there
and asked if she'd take them up and get a coffin and put them in it
and bury'em in th'graveyard. Told her where t'bury'em.
Then he said, "You come back and look out there at th'gate under
th'tree and dig down so fer"—I forget just how fer. Said his money'uz
buried there and he wanted her to have it.
Th'next morning th'old man come back at daylight and asked her
if she was ready t'go. He wouldn't come in.
She said no, she wasn't ready t'go, and wanted to know why he
didn't come back. He told her th'house was hainted.
She said, "You just go along if you want to. I've got a job to do.
And she just dug that ol'hearth rock up and got him up and took him
and buried him and dug th'money up, and it was shore'nough money-
Said he had a lot a'money buried out there.
But I don't know if I could have read with that blood a'droppin
or not. I'd be afraid somethin' was upstairs hurt and would've come
a'tumblin' down!

I don't know who told me this'n. Somebody said they was a
preacher and he had a boy that was awful mean, and all he done was
hunt—fox hunt, y'know. Ever" evenin' said he'd gather up his ol'pots-
'n'pans and his dogs and his gun and go out campin'.
And said his daddy thought if he could just scare him, maybe he
wouldn't go. So he went up to th'church and left his Bible up there.
He'd hired a man t'scare him, y'know, up there at th'church.
Th'boy was a'gettin' his food and stuff up ready t'go, and he said
t'him, said, "Son, you goin' a'huntin' tonight?"
And he said, "Yeah, I thought I would."
And he said, "I wonder if you could run up to th'church and get me
my Bible before you go."
"Oh, yeah," he said. "I got plenty a'time."
So th'boy, he went runnin' up there to git th'Bible, opened up
th'church door and walked in. Said he got good'n'started, and
said there'uz somebody in behind th'pianer said t'him, "What are
y'after?"
And he said, "I come after my pa's Bible."
Said he said, "You're not a'gonna git it."
And he said, "I'll git it too."
And he said, "You ain't a'gonna git it."
Said th'boy just kept a'walkin' and went on up through there. Said
he was just a'cussin' as he went, th'boy was.
And he come on back, and th'preacher was sort'a surprised that he
got th'Bible. He said, "Well, did you git it?"
And th'boy said, "Yes. I got it." And cussed again and said, "I had
a time a'gettin' it. They'uz somethin' up there said I wadn't gonna git
it, but I showed'em anyhow. I got it."
So he laid th'Bible down and got his dog and went on and went to
a old house. He was a'makin' his coffee and fryin' his meat, and said
his coffee boiled and he set it over in th'corner. Said th'stairway come
down in th'corner there, and said they'uz a box like a big size tool
box come a'slidin' down'n slid right up on th'hearth rock right by
where he was.
He looked around and said, "That's a mighty nice thing t'set my
coffee pot on." Said he just picked it up and set it down on it.
Was fryin' his meat and th'lid began t'come up. He said, "Wait a
minute! Hold on! You're gonna spill my coffee!"
He set his coffee pot down and said somethin' come out. It was
somebody with a white shirt and no head on, and said he told th'boy
about his money. Asked if he had a sister and he said he did.
"Th'haint said, "I want you t'divide it with her. If you'll give her half

354 
FOXFIRE 2
of it, you'll never hear from me again; but if you don't divide it with
her equal, I'll be back every time when you don't want me t'be."
So he went and dug th'money up and went on back and sent half
of it to his sister, wherever she was.
Now I believe I'd run when somethin' began t'spill my coffee!
MINYARD CONNER: There was a boy that went possum huntin'
one night. Took his dog and his lantern, and he'uz a'goin' along up a
holler, and they'uz a old tiny log house up there. It was about fell
down, y'know.
He seen a little dim light in it, and he just put his light out, y'know.
And he just kept easin' up and easin' up, and atter while he peeped
through a crack, y'know.
He looked in there and he seen five'r'six oh awful pretty women in
there just a'dancin' around, y'know. Around'n'around. Just watch-
in'em.
Atter while one come up t'th'chimney, reached down and got a'hold
a'th'hearth rock and turned it up sideways. She rubbed her hand down
on th'back side, y'know, and rubbed it on her chest and said, "Up and
out and over all; up and out and over all." He said she was gone like
a flash then.
Said th'last one done that. Said when she done that, she kicked
th'rock back.
Well, he got a'hold a'that rock and he begin t'hive and hive, and di-
rectly he pulled it up—yanked it up sideways. Put his hand over there
where they had been a'feelin'—where they had been rubbin' their
hand. It felt sort'a greasy to him.
He just rubbed th'rock, y'know, and he said, "Up and out and
through all. Up and out and out through all." They had said, "Over
all," y'know.
And he give th'rock a kick and he just out th'window he went just
like a flash, y'know. Out through th'hills and briers and bushes,
y'know, just a'knockin' and bangin' and slammin' and cussin'. And he
kept goin' and goin' and he went across a big wide river and ended up
where they was havin' a dance. Big fine place, y'know. Said they was
big white horses all around there.
And said he went in and he danced with'em. Said one of'em come
t'him and said t'him, "Now don't say th'Lord's name at all!" He give
hisself t'th'Devil. Said they went up ready t'leave then.
Said they went back out and they all got on their horses and here
they went. Said they pointed to a bull calf -\nd he began t'stamp. Said,
'This is your horse"

============================================================

So he jumps on that little devil. Said here they went just a'keepin'
up with them big white horses, just a-lip-a-tee-lip tee-lip tee-lip—
goin" right on.
Said directly they come to a great big creek. Said they all jumped it
and that bull calf just laid right in there and went across with'im.
Said directly they jumped a big wide river. Said he said, "God Al-
mighty what a jump!" and he was in th'dark!

Logically enough, the kinds of phenomena described here have given rise
to a number of superstitions, many of which are still firmly held as fact
by individuals here. Ed Watkins, for example, claims that if you rebuild
or repair a part of your house with new lumber, any ghosts that are
there will leave. Others follow.
JIM EDMONDS: A witch will come t'borry somethin'. If they don't
get nothin', then they can't do nothin' to you.
I heard about a man—a witch said he'd make a witch out a'him if
he followed him. They come t'this door and th'witch said, "Hi-ho,
hi-ho! In th'keyhole I go." He went on in and got all he wanted.
Th'other feller said th'same thing and in he went and got all he
wanted—ate all he wanted.
Th'old witch came and said, "Hi-ho, hi-ho! Out th'keyhole I go,"
and went on out.
Th'old man came and thought he'd do what th'other did and said,
"Hi-ho, hi-ho! Up th'high hole I go," and fell t'th'floor!
You just had t'pay no 'tention t'witches. They can put a spell on
you, but they can't turn you into a witch if you pay them no mind.
ETHEL CORN: I was livin' in Charlotte—we lived off in th'back-
woods. There one night about eleven o'clock we looked up an'thought
th'house was on fire.
( I got up and looked out, and back in th'east it looked like th'sun
a'drawin' water—but it looked like streams a'blood a'comin' down.
And it went straight a'towards th'north and it lit up till you could'a'-
picked up a pin in th'house. I guess it'uz ten'r'fifteen minutes goin' on.
And it looked like that was blood comin' plumb down t'th'ground.
They was a lot a'people see'd it, but nobody knowed what it was. It
lit up th'whole house, and it like t'scared th'young'uns all to death,
I wasn't scared because I believed it was representin' a fulfillin' of

============================================================

PLATE 352 Ethel Corn
places in th'Bible. An' I got th'Bible and got t'readin' in Revelations
where it speaks of all these things and wonders that we'll see—it was
somethin' that God had sent. It wadn't intended fer us t'know just
what it was all about.
And before Uncle Jake Collins died, he see'd a light, and it looked
like a torch. It was just two'r'three days before he died—er nights
rather. They was a trail come from th'house down through our
swamp, and he watched hit, an' hit come on down right at th'end of
th'swamp and went up by his bee gums and come down nearly
t'th'kitchen door, an' hit went out.
It was just two'r'three days after that that he fell dead, and we al-
ways thought it was a "talkin' " of his death, because "talkin's" will be
of things t'happen like that.
Looked like somebody just a'carryin' a pine torch lit in their hand,
an' it come down t'right at th'kitchen door and it just vanished.
And another "talkin'"—we had been workin' in th'fields up be-
hind th'old Union Chapel Church, and hit went like benches and
everythin' else turnin' over in that church. And I thought there was
somebody in there who'd broke in, and I went and th'doors was still
locked; and I looked in th'winders and we never could see nothin'-
There was no benches ner nothin' disturbed.
And I went on home. That evenin' late they come and told me
Gertrude Norton was dead. They'uz goin' up there t'ring th'bell.

\L*NT NORA GARLAND: My mother and Aunt Jane—they was
voung girls then—they were a'goin' some'ere t'spend th'night with
somebody, and they were goin' together, y'know. They was t'meet in a
certain place.
Well, she waited and waited and waited there in that place, and she
never did come. And she started up th'road and she looked back and
seen her a'comin just as plain as she'd ever see'd anybody in her life.
But it wasn't her. She was dead. That was th'reason she wasn't
comin'. She was dead.
She said she'd see'd her plainer than anybody in this world, and
stopped and waited and thought that she was comin' on, but she never
did come—some kind of a vision.
And they say t'never look back, y'know. They say t'never look back
'cause if y'do, you'll be th'next t'die.
MYRTLE LAMB: I always possum hunted. We would always go on
a rainy night in these old fields. That is th'place t'go. They would al-
ways go up in a old tree that is growed where nobody lives. Go on a
dark, drizzly night. I always had th'best luck with'em.
I was comin' back, and m'shoes was hurtin' m'feet. I set down
t'pull m'shoes off. I just felt like somebody was right behind me. I
looked back, and he was just a little ways from me. He said he wanted
t'pray fer me.
I said if he wanted t'pray fer me t'stay right there. I wadn't a'goin'
with'im.
Then a night'r'two after that, he claimed he'd been to Franklin. I
believe he was tryin' t'come up Middle Creek and said he got lost.
Then he come—said he wanted a lantern.
I didn't feel like he was gone, and I went upstairs and looked out
th'window and he'uz standin'—his light was shinin' out from under
th'porch.
My mother and my brother went out and he run through th'corn
fields.
Later it was like somethin' up in th'upstairs jumpin' up and down.
1 heard it twice. People said that was a warnin', and th'next day, my
Mother got bad off with pneumonia.
MRS. MARY CARPENTER: I reckon I must be superstitiousY-
somethin', whatever y'call it. If a rooster crows of a night, th'older
people said somebody'd be sick. Or if somebody went t'bed a'laughin'
and a'cuttin' up and a'havin' fun, somebody'd be sick in th'family, or
your neighbor'd be sick'r'some one of'em dead.

One night 
and 
went t'bed a'laughin' and a'cuttin' up,
and their mama said, "Cut that out in there."' Said, "Somebody 11 be
sick in th'mornin'."
And said next mornin' 'fore they got up that somebody was
knockin' on their door. Their closest door neighbor, one of'em was
dead.
And you heard about my boy fallin' on his shotgun and gettin' shot?
Well, about two'r'three nights before—now I don't know if that had
anything to do with it or not—but that rooster crowed at midnight
and I thought it was time t'get up. They wake me up when they crow,
so I jumped up—thought it was time fer'im t'get up and go t'school.
And I got up and it was just midnight. And John, he told me that
chickens crowed anyhow at midnight, and I said, "Well, maybe they
do."
I didn't think too much about it, but it wadn't too long till I was
back asleep and they waked me up a'crowin' again. Well, I bounced
out t'see if it was time t'get up and go again, and it was between two
and three o'clock. And I knowed then. I thinks, "Well, somethin' must
be goin' t'happen t'us."
And two'r'three days after that, LeRoy, he started t'huntin'. And
there was snow on th'ground, and ice, and he stepped on a log with
ice on th'log and his foot slid and he fell off backards off th'log and
shot his foot in two.
I don't know. I guess there's nothin' to it, but I couldn't help think it
was because that rooster crowed. I killed th'rooster. Yeah, I killed that
rooster before he ever got out of Greenville Hospital. Took him off out
yonder and dug a hole and buried him.

"They'd come in and shuck m'corn, sing, and have th'best time. You've
never seen such a good time as they had! I wish you could go to a corn
shuckin' sometime."
houghts like this one ex-
pressed by Aunt Arie were
what really kindled our
interest in researching this chapter. When we got into it, we became
truly fascinated by the various community activities that people were
involved in back in the "old days." Simple things like candy pullings
and ice cream parties and singings delighted people no end—particu-
larly young people.
What really amazed us, though, was the way people took a dull, ar-
duous task and turned it into a time for fun and warm fellowship.
Corn shuckings and house raisings and log rollings became a time for
neighbors to pitch in and have the best times of their lives while work-
ing with and helping each other.
We decided that the best way to get the real feeling across would be
through the words of the people themselves. Here is what they had to
say.

CORN SHUCKIN'S
FLORENCE AND LAWTON BROOKS: We used t'have them old
shuckin's. They'd just pile up their corn in their barnyard, y'know, in-
stead a'puttin' it in their crib. And then they'd ask all their neighbors
around t'come in. And they'd always bury a drink right in th'middle
a'that pile and pile their corn on top a'it. Then we'd have t'shuck all
th'corn t'find it. We'd shuck all night t'get t'that half-gallon a'liquor.
Then we'd all have a drink and probably have a dancin' th'rest
a'th'night, if we got done in time.
God, you never seen such shuckin' corn.
Then sometimes they'd have it where th'man that found th'first
red ear got t'kiss th'prettiest girl, and sometimes he'd shuck like
th'devil tryin' t'find a red ear a'corn. Somebody'd find one generally
ever'time. It was funny because back then 'at was th'worst thing a
boy and girl could do would be caught kissin'. That's th'worst thing
you could do!
Ever'body'uz invited. Wasn't nobody skipped. They invited th'young
and old. They all come together. And you never seen such corn shucks
in your life. And if we got done at midnight'r'somethin' like that, why
we'd have a big dance from then on to towards daylight. We never
counted none on sleepin' that night. No way when we was havin'
them big corn shuckin's 'cause we knowed it'd take th'biggest part
a'th'night.
'Bout all th'way we had a'havin' fun was at them shuckin's. But I
thought it was mighty nice a'them t'have things like that. I wish they'd
have'em now back like they used to. There'uz lots a'fun in that.
WILL ZOELLNER: Sometimes th'first one that got a red ear'ud get
a ten-dollar prize. That's what they called pokeberry corn. Looked like
poke come in it. And ever' once in a while you'd get a plumb red ear.
And th'girl that got th'red ear, she chose her partner t'dance with
later.
One I went to—was about fifteen families lived over there, Ledfords
and Penlands and Duncans—whoever got th'first red ear got a Jersey
cow. Nicest thing you ever looked at. Well, we got t'shuckin' around
there, and finally got in a fight throwin' corn east and west. Somebody
socked me with a ear down th'side a'th'head and I caught th'thing,
and it'uz a blood-red ear! When it hit my head, I seen th'red corn fly.
I cracked it right quick—pulled th'shuck off—and says, "Look what
y'done! Gimme good luck!"

So I got that—'bout a two-year green-colored Jersey heifer. I sold
it—got about a hundred dollars fer't.
MRS. HARRIET ECHOLS: Used t'be all these areas in here was
big farms. Mr. Cabe would haul up wagon loads of pumpkin, water-
melons, and corn. Well, they and all their neighbors'ud get their corn
gathered in, and then they'd start'n'they'd go from place't'place—
maybe twice a week they'd have a corn shuckin' at a different place.
And all th'men'ud get in th'barn and shuck, and if there was too
many women, they'd go help shuck too. And then th'others'ud cook
supper—have a big supper just like we have goin' t'a church supper'r'-
somethin' like that.
And then they'd put th'corn in log cribs made where th'air could go
through and finish dryin' th'corn they'd gathered in from th'fields.
And they'd store th'pumpkins in a barn and cover'em with th'shucks
and th'leavin's from th'corn t'keep them through th'winter.
And, well, it's just fascinatin' how they did.
AUNT ARIE: Well, Pappy'ud raise a big crop a'corn—maybe two
hundred bushels—and put it in a crib shed. On a certain day they'd
have a corn shuckin' and get all th'neighbors from ever'wheres t'come
in here. If we had'em like we used to, we'd have ever'one a'you
younguns come down here and we'd have th'best time.
PLATE 357 
While gathering research for this chapter, we either tried or
watched others try many of these activities. We enjoyed some of them so much
we're still doing them. Every year, for example, a bunch of us get together and
go up to Aunt Arie's to plant, and then later to harvest and shuck her white corn
and popcorn . . .

They'd always come at dinner time—some of them before dinner.
Well, they'd sit down t'eat, and then they'd go on t'shuckin'. Some-
times they'd shuck till twelve at night before they'd ever get up, and
sing and holler and hoop and all th'devil! And they'd take th'shuck
and hide people in'em and do ever'thing. Why they had ever' kinda
fun in th'world. That made people love t'go to'em. If you'd been con-
trary or hateful, wouldn't a'been nobody'd wanted t'go.
When they got th'corn shucked, they'd put th'man of th'house on a
rail and carry him t'th'house and set'im down and comb his head—
comb th'lice off his head down on th' floor and stomp'em with their
feet. You know, that wadn't so, but they just done that fer th'devil-
ment and fun!
MARINDA BROWN: I always got th'biggest thrill out a'that—just
th'children and me. Just th'very smallest children would get in and
shuck corn and always look for th'red ears. Ever'body that found a red
ear had t'be kissed. I didn't like that too much, though!
They'd come all day and just spend th'day, y'know, and go up into
th'night. And then they'd have a dance. We'd have our lanterns and
lights around, y'know, and we'd shuck up into th'night and have a big
feast with tables loaded with all sorts of good foods.
MRS. E. H. BROWN: That was just a good time for us all. We en-
joyed bein' together and doin' somethin' t'help somebody, too.
HOUSE AND BARN RAISIN'S
MRS. HARRIET ECHOLS: If they was goin' t'build a new barn,
they got all th'logs t'gether, and all th'neighbor men got in and put up
th'barn. They'd build a barn in a day—put in th'sheds and stalls and
ever'thing. And if they didn't finish, they'd come back th'next day
and cover it. And they didn't have any pulleys'r'anything t'horse those
logs up. Three'r'four men'ud get on each end of a log and they'd just
come up with it.
Of course, th'kids at that time was usually at school, y'know. And
th'women gathered there and cooked, and they'd have up a quilt and
be sewin' on it.
They got all th'material t'gether and had ever'thing there, and
they'd set a certain day fer'em all t'meet, and then they went t'work.
ANNIE PERRY: This house was built that way. Th'neighbors'ud cut

th'logs and split th'logs. Then they'd cut th'notches in th'corners
t'keep'em from rollin' off. My grandma said that th'logs this house'uz
built out of was right out of our woods—cut right around in rollin'
distance. This house'uz built in 18 and 69. My grandmother moved
here in August and she didn't have a fireplace t'cook on, and she
didn't have a cookstove.
After th'raisin's they'd put th'stock in if it was a barn, and they'd
have a dance if it was a house. Called it a house warmin'.
LAWTON BROOKS: Most of'em we built was log houses, and we'd
pitch in and in a couple a'days we'd have a man a house built. Ever'-
body'd just go in and help a man. Wasn't countin' on gettin' a dime
out of it. 'Course they'd have a big supper, and when we got done we
always had somethin' at th'end—some kinda big party'r'dance in
th'house 'fore they ever moved in when they wasn't nothin' in th'way.
You take fifty men and it didn't take but a little bit t'build a dad-
blame house. It went up fast. Some done th'notchin'. Some done
th'layin' up. Some carryin' th'logs. Some peelin' th'logs. They'uz
always a job fer every bunch, and ever'body'uz on their job and they

kep' ever'thing goin', y'know. God, it didn't take long t'build a big
house. Puttin' down th'floorin' was th'biggest job in it. "Course they
didn't get matched floorin'. They just got rough plankin', and they'd
jam'em down as close as'ey could and go on about their business.
But it was lots a'fun.
AUNT ARIE: We had a house raisin' t'raise this house, and we had a
barn raisin' t'raise th'barn. We had t'go t'th'mountains and get th'logs,
and then get th'nails and whatever we needed t'have ready, and then
we asked a whole lot a'men t'come in and raise th'house.
You'd need four men with good axes, and they'd have t'know what
t'do. Each one took a corner of th'house, and th'others stood on
th'ground and got th'logs ready and rolled'em up there where they
notched'em and put'em down. Next thing y'know, they'd got up
th'square of th'house.
And somebody'ud lay them rafters off a certain way and cut
th'notches in th'rafters and nail'em t'gether at th'top and put'em up.
I've helped do all of that.
Th'house ain't hard t'raise like th'barn. See, th'house is made
out'a little logs, and th'barn is made out'a big logs. And th'barn's got
four big stalls in it—maybe more. It took eight men for four stalls. You
hardly ever got a barn raised in one day. No sir. It was too big. Too
much.
There's not many people knows how t'put a roof on that won't leak.
If y'don't get th'shingles on right, it'll leak. Now I've helped put on
shingles.
MRS. ADA KELLY: A new couple'ud start t'build them a house,
they'd have a house raisin'. Th'men all around th'community'ud go
in and get th'framin' of th'house up and all they could that day, and
then they'd have a house coverin'—meet and cover th'house and go
on with it till they finished. Then th'couple was ready t'move in.
You couldn't get anybody t'do that fer y'now, could you? But they
wasn't any vacant houses around then. My father built his house.
I'uz born in a log house. Had two rooms downstairs and two rooms
upstairs and a big old fireplace.
RICHARD NORTON: When somebody went t'build a house,
ever'body flew in and helped'em. T'get th'logs up, most of th'time they
used what we called skid poles. They'd lay up poles against th'house,
and four'r'five men'ud get ahold a'them logs and roU'em right up
them poles on th'house.

Sometimes they got'em up there first and notched'em after they
got'em up there. They generally used smaller logs, and they'd turn'em
up and notch'em and then turn'em back over t'fit.
QUILTIN'S
MARGARET NORTON: People'ud work all fall piecin' quilt tops,
and when they got'em all pieced, they'd invite in all th'neighbors and
have a quiltin', and that quilt'ud be for th'person that invited'em in.
And whoever they had th'quiltin' for furnished all of'em dinner. If
it'uz at your house and it'uz for you, you'd furnish th'whole dinner—
even if they'uz twenty women there.
They could quilt one out in a day easy. Lots a'times we've had
quilts out at breakfast and quilted two.
MARINDA BROWN: People used t'get t'gether and they'd just put
up one. They could make as many days out of it as they wanted to.
They'd piece one fer one family, set in and draw another one fer an-
other family, y'know; just kind'a kept it goin'.
PLATE 361 
We went to several quiltings. This one was on Betty's Creek where
a lot of our contacts had gotten together to make two Poplar Leaf quilts for
their Home Demonstration Club. For this quilting, each lady had pieced one
square at home. When they were done, another lady gathered up the squares
and sewed them together with borders to make the two tops. Then they all got
together for the actual quilting.

ANNIE PERRY: They had quiltin's, but I never could quilt. My
stitches were s'long you'd have t'keep your toenails broke off t'keep
from gettin'em hung!
People were neighbors. They all helped each other t'do things. If
you got anything t'do now, y'do it yourself or you let it go undone—
whichever y'want to.
PEA THRASHIN'S
LAWTON BROOKS: Ever'body planted these old clay peas. I ain't
seen'em in over twenty years. Th'seeds of'em's about t'run out. People
used t'always plant'em in their cornfield.
Well, they'd go and pick'em and carry'em and pile'em up in great
big ol'piles. Put'em on big sheets, y'know. Then we'd all cut us a pole
t'beat with and you'd just beat, then you'd stir up a while, and then
you'd beat again. Th'hulls'ud pile up on top. Then you'd stir t'get
y'some more up that hadn't been hit, y'know. Then you'd beat'em
again.
They'd grow lots a'them back in 'em'days. They'd grow'em and sell
th'things. You could buy'em fer nothin' nearly a bushel. But still, that
was a way a'gettin' some money. You had t'do th'best y'could. They
growed them peas, and what they didn't eat, they sold. And they'd get
out there and we'd thrash'em out fer'em. Thrash'em old peas out—
have th'goodest old time y'ever seen.
SINGIN'S
MARGARET NORTON: When you'd have a singin', you'd usually
have a group of people get together and sing and have refreshments
like tea and coffee and ice cream, y'know. They'd gather at different
persons' houses, or at th'church—whoever had a pianer'r'organ—
and they'd play and sing just like any other get t'gether.
Usually y'sung religious songs, but sometimes they'd have like a
sports party where you'd just sing sports songs. But usually it was reli-
gious songs, and we'd sing for two'r'three hours and have a few re-
freshments and go home.
And then sometimes they had'em all night long. You'd start at
eleven o'clock and then go th'rest of th'night. As fer me, I'm not a
good hand t'set up till all hours. I'd go t'sleep!
HARRY BROWN: They'd have'em in their houses, and then some-

times they have'em up there at Andy Cope's fish farm. He's a great
singer, and this fella' from Lakemont—Horace Page—all them go up
there and sometime they sing all night.
I'd just go t'listen t'it. I never did sing. They used t'have old-time
songs, y'know, like, "Walkin' in th'King's Highway," but they don't
sing anymore. Oh, and, "They're Namin' th'Prophet, That Honora-
ble Man," and, "On Down t'th'River Jordan." But th'songs they sing
now is different from when I'uz growin' up.
And sometimes at th'church we'd have what they called an "all
day singin' an' dinner on th'grounds." That was good too.
FLORENCE AND LAWTON BROOKS: Lord, yeah. People used
t'have singin's at their houses. Sometimes we'd walk ten miles t'one.
They'd have songbooks, y'know, with gospel songs, and th'house'ud be
full a'people. They used t'do that lots—move all over th'settlement.
When me an'Florence was married we done 'at fer a long time. Fer
years after we'uz married we went nearly ever'night. Lots a'times peo-
ple'ud have t'walk four'r'five miles, but they'd go. They'd be there.
They'd all go.

FOXFIRE 2
That was about th'only thing that went on durin' th'week, and
that'ud give th'young people a place t'go, and they'd always go. If a
old boy got him a girl, he'd have her come t'th'singin', y'know. Had a
nice time. Always had a nice time. No joke about it—it was nice. I
think there ought t'be lots more. Wouldn't be half as much meanness
done.
But they quit all that now, I reckon. Don't hear tell a'that no more.
LOG ROLLIN'S
LEX SANDERS: In log rollin's, you'd go all over th'community and
gather up maybe twenty-five men. Then they'd cut logs and clear land
and do a whole lot a'work in a day.
It'uz like th'old workin's. Lot a'th'women'ud come t'th'workin' and
get dinner. And as a general thing, when they had a log rollin', they'd
be eight'r'ten women there that'ud have a quiltin' too, and maybe
make one'r'two quilts while th'men'uz cuttin' and rollin' th'logs.
RICHARD NORTON: They had log rollin's when they cleared
th'land. I remember when they'd go t'what they called "new ground"
and they'd clear it off, y'know. Then they'd have big log rollin's, and
they'd pile all them logs up and burn'em. Th'women'ud always cook
dinner, and they'd be twenty-five men maybe, and they'd clear a big
field in a day—roll it up and burn it, y'know.
CANDY PULLIN'S
MRS. ADA KELLY: When they made syrup, th'last run of th'syrup
they'd cook up a whole lot of, and they'd cook it down till it got real
thick. And just along toward th'last before it got ready t'take up,
they'd put some soda in it. I really don't know what that did to it, but
it seemed t'make it get whiter or something.
And a boy and a girl would usually butter a dish and cool it off some
and then get it up in their hands, y'know, and work it till they could
get it in a ball. Then th'boy would get at one end and th'girl at
th'other, and they'd pull backwards and forwards till they got it so it'd
pull out in great long pieces.
Then they'd divide some of it and pull it out in long pieces sort of
like stick candy and lay that out on a platter'r'something. When it got
cold, you could just take a knife and crack it all, and it'd be sort'a like
yellow stick candy. It was real good.

And they always had boys and girls doing it together. That was all
th'fun there was in it. Just invite th'young folks in t'make syrup candy.
WILL ZOELLNER: Y'grease yer hands with lard so it don't stick on
yer hands. If y'ain't got no lard on yer hands, it gets all over yer hands
and gets warm.
And y'go out there and get yer partner and cut that syrup out in big
pieces, and then y'pull that and keep a'pullin' around and around till
it gets plumb yella'.
Sometimes we'd go and have a corn shuckin' and candy pullin' and
a all-night dance on New Year's. Dance th'old year out and th'new
year in, and have stuffed turkeys and have a midnight supper. Then
we'd have a drink outside. Had all kind'a cider where we were there.
And once in a while had some blackberry wine—take a little swig
a'that.
MRS. E. H. BROWN: They'd have those candy pullin's, and they'd
have it all braided and in all kinds of shapes, y'know. They'd get it
t'where they could pull it out and shape it any way they wanted to.
MAUDE SELLERS: Oh! I've pulled candy till I had blisters on my
hands!
CANDY BREAKIN'S
MRS. E. H. BROWN: They'd have a dishpan fulla stick candy broke
up into little pieces, and they'uz different colors, y'know. And th'pan
was covered. And a girl and boy would pair off and go and reach un-
der there and get a piece a'candy. If they each got a piece alike, why
they could keep it, but if they didn't, they had t'put it back.
Last one I believe I remember ever bein' at was at my husband's
home, and he carried me home that night after th'candy breakin'.
RICHARD NORTON: We'd just buy this peppermint candy—all
kinds a'candy. Somebody'ud take a dishpan and cover it up and you
had t'reach in there. If you and your partner didn't get th'same
kind'a piece, you had t'pay it back, but if you did, you kept it.
There'd be twenty-five, y'know, sometimes; and it'd circle 'round
and 'round, and you'd see who got th'most candy—who was th'lucki-
est, y'know. And boy would they have fun when y'had t'put your
candy back!

sugar and flavorin', and it's delicious; but where y'put a lot a'eggs in
it, it's s'rich y'can't eat much of it). And we'd get about five ice cream
freezers and invite th'youngsters in, and we'd get in th'parlor and get
around th'organ'r'piano and sing and play games. See, we didn't have
anywhere t'go. And that's what we did for our recreation was our par-
ties.
And we had our singin's, and we'd meet during th'week and we'd
go t'prayer meetin' on Wednesday night and sing and practice songs
fer th'choir and fer church on Sunday. And then on Saurday nights
we'd have our ice cream supper—and in th'wintertime a candy pull-
in'. And we'd gather nuts and have a nut crackin' t'make our candy if
we wanted t'make fudge'r'anything like that.
And three'r'four of th'girls would get t'gether and make five'r'six
cakes, and we'd have cake and ice cream.
And we went t'dances in th'wintertime, and we'd have apple bob-
bin's, and we just had th'best time. We never went to a dance with-
out our parents, and we'd just roll back th'rug if they had a rug; and
if they didn't, we'd put meal on th'floor. And th'band would come in
from th'little town. There was several of th'old men could pick a guitar
or banjo or fiddle. And, well, we just had a good time!
MARGARET AND RICHARD NORTON: People used t'help each
other kill hogs, too, when they had hogs t'kill. Th'neighbors'ud come in
and help. Ever'body got a mess a'meat and went back home. You had
four'r'five hogs t'kill, and half a dozen'r'more'ud come t'help y', and
they'd do it for a combination and a mess a'meat.
R.: We just give'em a mess a'meat a lot of times. Me and my uncle,
we'd gather together and kill big hogs. We'd always dress one out
then, and then we'd kill two'r'three more for th'other feller, and
two'r'three more for th'other feller till we had'em all killed and dressed
out. We could get it all in one day.
M.: We had square dances, too. They'd get all th'furniture out of
th room, and had somebody a'callin' and somebody a'pickin', y'know.
R.: We always had Bill Lamb play th'fiddle, and had some banjo
and guitar pickers, too, y'know. They was a lot a'young people around
here then.

This fall we helped Clark Norton and Jerry Ayres slaughter,
dress, and salt down two hogs. Here we try to help scrape the hair off after
scalding the hog with hot water. They got a lot of laughs at our clumsy attempts
to help, but we tried—and enjoyed just being together.
M.: We had th'whole place covered up with young people. They
hadn't got this crave then t'go up t'Atlanta'r'some big city. They just
stayed on and helped farm in th'summer time and then go t'school in
th'wintertime and have fun.
M.: Had barbecues, too.
R.: We just dug out a square place and piled it full'a hickory wood
and burnt it down t'coals. Then we'd take poles and gather that hog—
'course his innards took out and ever'thing, y'know 
and we'd run'em
through his hind and shoulders. Th'poles'ud be long enough t'reach

across that hole, and we'd put him down over it and we'd have t'turn
it ever' so often. Cook'im all night.
M.: They'd sit up all night, and next mornin' th'stew'ud be made—
th'Brunswick stew.
R.: We cooked generally two sheep and a hog.
M.: Th'other people'ud bring th'vegetables and th'bread and
th'things that went with it.
And we used t'get in t'gether and have bean stringin's and pea shell-
in's, too. We did that here last summer.
R.: We pile up a big pile there on a paper on th'floor and we all get
around it, y'know.
M.: And ever'body gets'em a pan and a chair and a place t'put their
hulls. First thing you know, you're finished.
And at Christmas time here we have a Christmas tree for all our
children on Betty's Creek. Th'women all come and we fix up th'pres-
ents there. So that's a get-together. We still do that. And we have got
together and preserved strawberries.
R.: All th'old people used t'double up like that. One'ud need some
work done, and they'd all just pitch in.
And even that doesn't exhaust the list. In addition to the above, peo-
ple grouped together for box lunches (each girl filled a cake box with a
picnic lunch for two and decorated its exterior. The boxes were then
auctioned off, and the boy with the highest bid shared the lunch with
the girl who had made it); wool cardings and spinnings; and workings
(when a man was sick, the neighbors would gather to plant or tend or
harvest his garden and do his chores until he was well again). And
that probably isn't all, either. The sense of community and interde-
pendence was so highly developed that there was simply little people
didn't do together. That amazes us now, but it also attracts us in some
mysterious way. Perhaps that interdependence is the source of part of
our nostalgia for a simpler time.
MRS. E. H. BROWN: I believe people enjoyed themselves more.
They didn't have very much for entertainment, y'know, and when we
did have some little something, we really enjoyed it. And ever'thing
was nice. Ever'body behaved themselves. I used t'go to country dances,
too. I never went t'a public dance in my life. It was always t'some
neighbor's house. And ever'body had better behave themselves. If they
didn't, they was invited t'go home.
My daddy was always th'fiddler. I've often told people I cut my
teeth on a fiddle bow.

Kenny Runion is a craftsman. He makes everything from laurel
wood rocking chairs to belts to wooden necklaces bespangled with
dime store jewels. He loves his work, he loves people, and he loves to
talk.
Kenny has always lived in the mountains and sometimes spends
hours each day tramping through them for his own enjoyment and in
search of old wood, rocks, and relics to use in his craft work. We
asked him how he learned to make such a variety of things: "Well, I
just studied it out. I'm about a third Indian and it just comes to me.
That belt there was hard to figger out. See, I'd never seen nary'un. I'd
never seed anything like that." He just uses his imagination.
Kenny lives alone in a tiny frame house. We interviewed him a num-
ber of times, and he was always ready and willing to talk—even if he
was in the middle of carving a chair leg. He'd pop up his hand in a
friendly wave and, grinning, say, "I'uz wonderin' when you were goin'
t'come see me again." Then he'd begin to talk about anything from
witchcraft to "whuppin's." Kenny's conversation is as well spiced with
wit and serious philosophy as his carving is with ingenuity and imagi-
nation.

People now's a'havin' a good time. Now whether it'll last . . . I'm
a'feared it ain't. They'll be somethin' happen. People ain't thankful no
more. They don't 'preciate what they got.
And ever'body's in a hurry. Where they goin'? Where they goin'?
Back then you could meet an ol'feller with an ol'ox wagon and he'd
stand there a half day if you wanted t'talk. Stand as long as you'd talk.
You meet a feller now, he'd run over y'. Where's he goin'? Just ain't
got no patience.
Yeah. Back then he'd just stop his two oxen in th'road and git off.
Talk as long as y'wanted t'talk. Maybe he'd give y'a drink a'liquor.
But now people's a'gittin' there fast, ain't they? People now, they go
more in a week then they went in a year back then. They go more
places now then they did in a year. They go more'n'more ever' week.
They's people raised around here—old people—never seed a train.
And now they're ever'where, ain't they? If they'd seed a airplane,
they'd run in th'house and shet th'door.
People made their livin' back there. They had a woods full'a hogs,
sheep, and cattle. Chestnut trees bent with chestnuts. All they had t'do
was go out in th'fall and go t'killin' hogs. Bring'em in just as fat as

thev got'em. They seen a good time, but they didn't have th'cars and
money. You'd see fellers goin' up and down th'road 'fore tax-payin'
time tryin' t'sell three bushel a'corn for a dollar.
We got fifty cent a day—or my pa did. I didn't get that; I was just
voung, y'know. Fifty cent from sunup to sundown. It was a lot a'hard
work. We got th'hardest jobs in th'world. Why, times then was tough.
You know what snuff is? You could get three box for a quarter.
Y'could buy you a big fried chicken fer fifteen cent. Dozen eggs fer a
dime—all y'wanted. Th'stores wouldn't buy'em. There wadn't no de-
mand fer'em. And all that stuff was as cheap as nothin'—but you
couldn't git nothin' fer your labor.
Buy you as good a cow as ever milked fer fifteen dollars. I'm talkin'
'bout th'best now. Git all th'liquor y'wanted fer a dollar a gallon.
Good corn liquor. Corn, fifty cent a bushel.
I guess it was better back then. A dollar ain't worth more'n a quar-
ter now. Back then, if you got a'hold of a dollar hit'd buy y'somethin'.
You'd git twenty pound a'meat fer a dollar.
I learnt how t'build fences, split wood, hoe corn. Worked just as
hard then as I do now. I was raised poor and still poor. Me and my
daddy'd work just anywhere we'd get a job. And we had fun. You had
people meet up, y'know, and drink and dance and have all kind'a fun.
No fights much. You could go down th'road in broad daylight with
five gallon a'liquor on your back and not be bothered. Shore you
could. You could go down with a five-gallon jug on your back and
never be bothered. It was twelve mile t'th'sheriff and there wadn't no
phone. Had t'walk it, and wadn't nobody goin' t'do that, y'know.
They'd just let y' go on.
Ever'thin's different. Ain't nothin' now like it was then. You didn't
go ever' time you sneezed then to a hospital. There wadn't nary'un.
Back yonder, th'doctor made a twenty-four-mile trip. He'd come here
and stay with y' about an hour. Doctor y' and give y'ever what you
needed. And when he got ready t'go and y'asked what y'owed him,
said five dollar. Five dollar. And what would that cost now? Cold or
hot, he'd come. He'd come cold or hot. He'd have a big gray horse
and a big bird dog'ud come lopin' right in with him.
And sometimes if y'got sick they'd have old granny doctors'at'ud
come see y'. Doctor y'up. If y'had th'flu—they called it th'grip then
they'd go out and get some boneset, some penny royal, and put a
big ol' pot on. Had fireplaces. They'd fill'er about half full; boil'er
down and give y' a teacup full of it and put y' in th'bed. You'd just
wet a sweat up. Few minutes and you'd be knocked out. You've took
quinine, ain't y'? 'At ol' bonesct's as bitter as it. Those old'uns would

come and doctor y'. Wouldn't cost you a dime. They'd stay all night
with y'.
And I never heard tell of 'pendicitis till I was growed. I watched ol'
Doc Lyons operate on a woman in Towns County fer one. I didn't
know there was such a thing. People called it th'cramp colic. They'd
lay down just as close t'that fire as they could get and bake that place.
Almost burn it.

Biggest thing they had was what they called dropsy. Yer feet go
t'swellin' down here and it just goes up. Other words, yer blood just
goes t'water is th'best way I can explain it t'y'. But la-a-a-aw, there's
ten t'heal y'now when there wasn't nary'un then.
If y'got yer leg broke, they'd know just what t'do. They'uz a feller
ridin' on a wagon and he'uz settin' down on th'couplin' pole. Don't
know what he meant 'less he'uz drunk. And his feet was just about 'at
fer from th'ground [about a foot], and he hung his foot there again' a
stump and broke his leg square in two. Just broke it. Way they done
when 'at happened, they just rolled his breeches leg up and go out
there and split some wood pieces and commence right here around yer
leg. They'd place it back th'best they could and go plumb around yer
leg with them little pieces. Then they'd tie it with a rope or a good

stout string and there you'd set fer about twelve month. And that's
what y'got. No doctor medicine. Didn't have no doctor medicine at all.
It'uz just pull and take it. No dopes. No dopes at all. No shots. No
nothin'. You'uz just there in trr chair.
Same way with yer arm. They'd take them little strips and go
around yer arm there. Then when they got plumb around it, they'd
tie it. Didn't need no sling. Couldn't get out'a there nohow fer them
strips. Now that's th'way they done with that cripple business. Law.
People back then shore didn't get it good. Wadn't a thing in th'world.
Not even asprin tablets.
Times are different now—great goodness, I reckon! They used t'be
an ol' Indian doctor come t'stay with us a long time. If I ever hear
anything, I've got her. I'll remember it. Said that poke root, it's as
poison as strychnine. You dig up th'root of it and roast 'at stuff like a
sweet 'tater, lay it down on somethin' like a clean cloth and cut it up
and put it t'th'bottom of yer foot. If you got a risin' here anywhere,
hit'll draw her out. I don't care how black yer foot is; when you pull it
off it's as white as cotton.
If y' had t'have a tooth pulled, you come in to a feller name of J.
Garrett. Say, "Lay down on 'at floor, feller." You'd stretch out here on
th'floor. He'd put one knee here [on your chest] and catch you just
like 'at [around your head]. He'uz stout, too. He'd put one of'em
homemade pullers in there and give her 'at [yanking]. If it broke off,
'at's all it wrote. If it broke off, he couldn't get it. But if it didn't
break, he'd bring it. You couldn't get up. He'd have one knee here [on
your chest]. Caught y' with his left hand and got in yer mouth. Take
his pocket knife and cut around it 'bout that deep [about a half inch].
Little blade of a knife. You could just hear that a'squrshin' in there.
Sometimes his pullers'ud slip off. Great goodness! You'd hear all
kind'a racket in your head. Just like bustin'. He'd say, "Oh. My pull-
ers slipped off." They'uz old homemade'uns from th'shop. Sometimes
they'd get slick and slip off. Great goodness! Might'nigh bust yer head.
He'd go back again. Keep on till he got it, unless it busted off.
But now when all 'at was over, you didn't owe him a dime. Didn't
owe him a thing. Didn't charge a dime. He'd pull half a dozen fer
each one of us. Not a cent. You had t'hold yer mouth wide or prop it
open with a stick. After it'uz pulled, you'd fill your mouth full'a salt.
You know how 'at hurt now. Washed yer mouth out and th'next day
it'uz feelin' good. You didn't go around with yer lip swellin' down here
with 'at old poison, y'know. Just looked like y'always did—if he
didn't bust it. If he busted it in yer mouth, then he'd have t'pull it
out by pieces. You didn't have many shots, either. Now boys, you had

t'have th'nerve. That tooth'ud ease about th'time you got on his porch
it'ud scare >' so blame bad. Then you might start home and it'ud start
hurtin' 'fore you got home. Hit'uz just pull it or let it hurt. Just suffer
on or he'd get it out. Now it's five bucks t'pull'em, ain't it?
[We asked Kenny to tell us the best advice his father ever gave
him.] Stay out of meanness. He raised me right. I've never been ar-
rested in my life. Never been in jail except goin' t'see my folks. Never
been locked up. Yeah. He raised me right. My mother, of course, was
tight on me too. I don't drink. Don't cuss. Don't do none a'that. If I
see I'm goin' t'meet bad company, why, if I have t'go by, I just say,
"Howdy," and go by. I don't fool with'em. Bad company'll get you in
trouble. "Course, I ain't a'feared when I get mad. I ain't scared of'em.
But I'd rather stay out of trouble.
Kids today do as they please. You know that? Mother'll tell'em
t'bring her a bucket a'water. Says, "Ain't goin' do it. You go get it
yourself." Boys, when I'uz raised up, my daddy told me t'do somethin'
and I done'er. I done'er. I tell'em now that a hick'ry don't hurt like
it used to. It don't hurt now.
I used t'get more whuppin's than anybody. Boys, I'm tellin' you
th'truth. Back then, people had their children under control. One
word and you'uz gone. My daddy used t'whup me and Gus fer fightin'
back when we was six, seven'r'eight year old. He didn't whup me with
a second handed hick'ry. He'd go out and get two. Now when he got
through with us, we'uz dressed out. And it wouldn't be long till we'd
get'er again.
I had a teacher in school. He'uz a fine feller. He sat in a new cane-
bottom chair sort'a in th'corner a'th'house. Guess he had twenty-five
hick'rys there. He'uz blame lazy when he whupped y'. He wouldn't
even get up. No, he wouldn't get up. But now you'uz dry cleaned
when he got through with y'. Boy, that'uz a mean teacher. About six
foot high and stout t'go with it. I couldn't whup nobody in a chair,
could you? He'd bring 'at hick'ry around 'at'a'way. Mankind! He'd
whup girls. It didn't make no difference. Anybody 'at'ud come up
there and disobey or didn't have their lessons.
But in a way, hit'uz worth somethin'. It'uz worth somethin'. Man-
kind, you had t'have 'at lesson. Ever' time you'd have—examination, I
call it—we all get in them seats plumb across. Not a dadgone book.
Nothin' but a tablet. And when they'd get askin' y'somethin', you had
t'put'er down. You had t'put'er down. You didn't have no book t'go
by, and you couldn't ask nobody, cither.
You had t'buy yer books. They didn't get y'nothin'. Had t'buy yer

books, yer pencils. We used a slate lots. Ever seed a slate? Then they'd
put out a pencil with that. Use that. Went t"school "bout eight hours
a day. In at eight and give us an hour at dinner and got off at four.
You didn't skip nothin'. You took it from th'floor up. After school'uz
out, if you could complete th'seventh grade you could teach school.
But I want you t'know, 'at old Sanford workbook was a bad'un. 'At
old speller. 'Bout that thick. I guess you've seed'em. Words in there 'at
long.
[Kenny has much longer hair than many of the people we inter-
view, so we asked him what he thought of young people wearing long
hair.] I think it's nice. Other words, it's hippie-like, ain't it? I believe
we ought t'be good to'em, don't you? I shore do. I like t'see'em with
long hair. My folks is all again' me wearin' it. I'm th'only one that
wears it. I've got a brother—he shaves ever' mornin'; has his hair cut
ever' week. 'At's his pride. Want t'look good, y'know. Look pretty.
Well now, 'at's what it's for.
You ought t'seed me. I cut my beard off. 'At beard was way down.
You wouldn't'a'knowed me if I'd a'come in th'street. It got t'botherin'
me—people a'laughin' at me, y'know—and I just cut it off. Yeah. I
really ought t'have some beard with m'hair t'look good. Long mus-
tache. Back when I was a boy, you never seed a man but what he
didn't have a beard way down t'here, or a mustache one. And long hair
like mine. Ever' one of'em. I don't believe it's wrong t'wear it. I've got
pictures down there at home of Jesus and his hair's way down here
hangin', fallin' 'round on his shoulders. That's what I told my folks.
Said, "Look 'at picture. You believe that?" I said, "It's not wrong.
Christ wore it, didn't he?" And Samson wore it till he cut it off, and
what'd he get into when he had his hair cut off? Makes y'stouter. It
does!
I don't think it makes much difference what y'wear. If y'want
t wear shorts, mini-skirts, or wear your hair long I don't think that
bothers y'. Do you? I ain't again' none of it. I've had big arguments.
People said, "Runion, you'll just argue anything."
I said, "I think it's nice."
I don't think it makes much difference what y'wear ner nothin'
'bout it. It's how yer heart is.
Yeah. Why, I ain't again' a hippie. Why, he's just a man just
wearin' his beard. I ain't again' him. But now, people'U talk. Some-
times when I go through Clayton I can hear'em back behind say,
"There goes another ol'hippie." They don't know me hardly.

Yeah. I ain't goin' have mine cut no more. I can't marry nohow,
and I'm just goin' t'let my hair grow.
[We knew Kenny had been married before, so we asked him why
he didn't feel he would ever marry again.] Scared I'll get in trouble.
Scared I'll get up in th'mornin' and she'd hit me with a stick'a'stove-
wood! Well, it's all right t'have yourself a woman, but I've stayed with
myself many a day. I've got used t'it. If I want t'get up at midnight, I
can. If I want t'lay to ten o'clock, I can. When I go in of a night, I
wouldn't mind havin' one. But it's ten or eleven o'clock 'fore I get
through sometimes. Trouble of it is, I might have t'go in and cook her
supper!
It'd be better if women stayed at their homes. I believe in a woman
stayin' at her home. I may be wrong, but they're really needed at home.
There's a lot t'do about a place, you know that? She's got a job t'keep
her house up. 'Course I don't keep my house up, but I keep it in
th'best shape I can. Housework's a job. Man don't know what a
woman goes through with. Beds t'make up. Dishes t'wash. And th'yard
t'sweep. Time you get that done, why it's just about ready for dinner
and all t'do over again. Woman's got a job if she keeps her house goin'.
If you marry twenty-five times, you'll study about your first wife.
It'll be on your mind in spite a'all you can do. You know how long it'll
be on it? Five long years. Five years y'can almost imagine her. And
you're liable t'mistreat your wife; say, "You ain't as good as my first'un
was. I'm sorry I married y'." First thing you know, you'll leave her.
Now you know if you ever marry, an' I guess y'will . . . anybody 'at
marries ought t'study a whole lot before they marry. Now I'm a'tellin'
y'th'truth. You get married, of course you can get a divorce, but that
ain't worth fifteen cent. It shore ain't. It ain't worth fifteen cent.
That'll loose y'from th'law, but it won't do yer mind no good. You'll
still worry 'bout that woman.
And y'get out there in court tryin' t'get a divorce, and you'll say,
"Well, she'uz t'blame." And she'll say you'uz t'blame and it'll take
forty lawyers t'tell who's right. But they will listen to a woman more'n
they will a man. They will now. Woman's got way yonder better a
chance, and a man don't stand none. Man'll speak and sell y'a line.
Says, "Well, she wouldn't stay at home with me or cook for me ner
wouldn't do a thing." Shoot y'a line.
She'd get up there and say, "Well, he mistreated me. Hit me with a
stick'a'stovewood 'fore breakfast." 'At'll pass [the jury will believe
that]. 'At's A number one, see?
[Knowing Kenny to be a religious man, we got on the subject of re-
legion and what proof there was for him of a God.] Well, it's right

here a'fore your eyes. You can see things a'happenin' ever'day. Dif-
ferent things. I was sittin' here th'other day and a ol'hen was comin'
through here that had chicks. She'd go a little piece. Then she'd cluck.
Now what cause her t'do that? I studied about that. Just sat here and
watched. She'd go a little piece; then she'd cluck again. Now what
makes her do that? 'At's Nature. 'At's Mother Nature.
And they'll sit there on those eggs three weeks, and 'at's Mother Na-
ture. Three long weeks. And they'll stay there, too. Well, there's some-
thin' behind that some'ers, or she'd get off and leave. There's some-

Why, you know that there's a power if y'just look out. Now they

[he points], and th'next mornin', it's here. Plumb across th'world.
What d'y'think about that now? And when it goes, it's dark nights.
And when it starts up, it's a bright light thing. It's little and gets big-
ger and bigger. What changes that? They's somebody—somethin'—
behind it. It'll change. Then it'll get fuller and fuller till it's a full
moon.
There's a whole lot to study about in this world, boy, when y'get
right on t'th'business. Shore is. Some says when y'die, if you're a sinner,
you'll go t'Hell and burn forever. Some says you won't do it. You'll
just burn up like paper. So that's another question. Well, I kindly be-
lieve you'll suffer. You just got t'take all'em old things and figger'em
out. Figger'em out.
[Kenny is a devout believer in keeping the Sabbath. He gave us
many reasons why the Sabbath should be a day of rest.] Now I don't
know fer shore if they's anybody in this world that keeps th'Sabbath.
If you read th'BiWe, it's pretty close. It says t'do nothin'. What is
nothin'? Now do you know what nothin' is? I believe it's wrong t'drive
a car on Sunday. Now I may be wrong. I'm just tellin' y' my belief
about it. I asked as good a mechanic as ever lived in this country, I
said, "I have arguments on drivin' cars on Sunday." I says, "Hit
work?"
He says, "If 'at ain't work, 'here ain't none."
'At's th'reason I say mighty few keeps th'Sabbath. I don't believe in
workin' then. I can say somethin' very few men can say. I never
worked fifteen minutes on a Sunday in my life. I never have. I tried
once and my brother jacked me up. I took a lot a'this stuff down
t'th'road t'sell it, and boy, he come down on me! He said, "Why,
Kenny, don't you know better'n'that? Today's Sunday, man." I took
t'th'house and never did come back n'more.

Yeah. You know way back then, they wouldn't even cook. They'd
have ever'thing cooked and lay it back t'eat on Sunday. No cookin' at
all. They'd have ever'thing ready.
I've hit tough luck. I know that's a self-learnin'. Fella' come up one
Sunday when I lived up yonder. I'uz fixin' t'go t'church. He'uz old—
about eighty-two year old—and said he wanted t'go back yonder
where he was raised. Well, I didn't want t'go. He said, "I'll have
y'back again before th'singin's over."
Well, you know when we come back we was in a wreck and just
both about killed. I just drawed plumb over. Couldn't even straighten
up. Three months 'fore I got good breath. We passed two churches
goin' over th'mountains, and he had a twelve-hunerd-dollar pickup
and it wouldn't a'brought fifty dollars. Tore it lit'raly all to pieces.
I tell y'now, you gotta notice. Lotta folks say, "Well, now, if I don't
work I'll lose m'job." That ain't a'gonna he'p you a bit. It didn't he'p
ol'Eve none when she eat that fruit. She said that ol'serpent got her
t'eat it. Did that he'p her? No. Didn't he'p her. And because his wife
told him t'eat it, that didn't do him no good and they was both drove
out of th'Paradise. Excuses has been from that day t'now. Excuses.
Lotta folks now, they mebbe say, "Well, I got a good excuse; th'car
didn't run right," or somethin'. But now you take it on this here latest
business. I don't believe that will he'p you a bit in this world. Yer ei-
ther right or wrong. Am I right or wrong?
[The Bible is one of Kenny's favorite topics of discussion. He has
his own colorful version of many stories, such as this one of Samson.]
Now a preacher argued me that Samson just had one wife. He ar-
gued me down, but he had two. They burnt.
After his first wife, he decided he wanted another one a'them oP Phi-
listines, and he went down and got'im another'n. And that's th'one
that had his hair cut. She kept on and on and then cut them seven locks
off and he wasn't more'n just a boy in strength then.
Then he went t'work pullin' a syrup mill. You ever see how they
grind cane? All kind'a jobs like that.
But it passed on and he got revenge. He didn't ask fer revenge in
only one thing: said he wanted revenge fer his two eyes. They
gorged'em out. It's a side a'rich people, I guess, t'have big times; and
ol'Samson, I'm satisfied he'uz up there in prison chained. "Come on
around! Go up and git Samson! Go up and git'im!"
'Course th'lad, he went and got'im. I'm satisfied he led'im with a
chain; brought'im back down. Sit around awhile and said, "Let's walk
out around th'buildin'."

Walked out there and Samson said, "Would you mind me a'stoopin'
down?"
'Course that lad, I reckon, told him yes. But when he reached down
he got aholt of each one a'them pillars and over she went. Killed him
and thousands. Five thousand on top of it.
Now you know it took strength and power t'do that. But he got re-
venge fer his two eyes. That's all. This whuppin' and beatin' and
dealin', he didn't rest w'that. He just revenged his two eyes. Them
ol'Philistines—they'uz rough.

[Out hiking with Kenny on several different occasions, we noticed
his keen communication with and love for nature. We asked him why
he liked to live out in the country.] 'At's where ever'thing's quiet.
Ever'thing is quiet. I hardly ever do go t'Clayton. You never see me
in Clayton hardly; unless I go a'ter some material fer m'job. I don't
like a town. Why, if Fuz t'go t'Atlanter, I could get a good job. Them
womens come up a'ter me from Floridy. But I just can't stand a town.
I'd ruther be in th'woods. I get t'feelin' funny'r'somethin'. I don't
feel right. I go t'town and I don't stay but just a little bit.
If I had children, I'd raise'em like this. In th'back woods. Sure is
better. Sure is. Stay out a'towns all y'can. Stay out a'towns.
[We asked him what he thought the difference was between people
who lived in the country and those who live in the city.] Well, I be-
lieve they get along better, and seem like they're more different. You
meet'em—they'll speak howdy to y\ You take these big towns, they
just go on by y' like you was a mile post. They're a lot more kinder.
More kinder.
A big town, they won't speak hardly at all. 'Course, I never saw a
stranger in my life. I go t'Atlanter, I talk t'somebody. But th'people in
th'country is more friendlier'n they are in town. They can't see so
much meanness goin' on.
You take like this here now, it's perfectly quiet. We hardly have
anybody t'come up here. But you take Atlanter. Gosh it's rough! Too
many cars bumper t'bumper. This world's full a'cars, you know it?
What you goin' t'do with'em? If they'uz all piled up, they'd be a
hunerd miles. Higher than trees!
I believe we'd live longer if we'd go back. We'd go slower, y'know,
and study as we go along. Back then, you could meet a man with a
yoke a'steers and they'd stop and talk t'you a hour at a time. Long as
you wanted t'talk. We couldn't do that now. She's too fur gone. No.
They's no hope.
[Relaxing in a rocker on his old front porch, Kenny looks across a
field of grazing horses toward a clear pond.] Me? I'm just goin'
through this world th'best I can. Don't bother nobody. Don't bother
nobody. I work out what I get; just gettin' through th'best way I can.
I don't claim t'be good, but I'm just doin' th'best I can. 'At's about all
anybody can do, ain't it?

3. BASKETS AND HAMPERS: A FRIDAY AFTERNOON
Only a few generations ago, a close and strangely beautiful inner
kinship existed between the people of this region. Neighbors were
friendly, reliable, and eager to help and teach each other. Times have
changed, though, and apparently so have people. Now such warm
traits are rarely found, but sometimes it still happens.
In The Foxfire Book (pp. 119-27), Aunt Arie and Beulah Perry
each showed us how to make different kinds of white oak split baskets.
Not long after that, Beulah said she wanted to try her hand at making
one of Aunt Arie's baskets, so we all got together at Aunt Arie's for an-
other lesson.
The day held its share of fun and confusion. Aunt Arie had another
gigantic meal to cook. Beulah struggled with splits too big and rough.
A car got stuck in the mud. And three copperheads showed up. Yet
Aunt Arie's meal was as delicious as ever, Beulah good-naturedly
yanked and pulled and laughed while we tried to resplit the splits, we
pushed the car out, and the snakes didn't bite. Beulah and Aunt Arie
made a basket and became friends. A lot of working, learning, and
laughing went on that day, and somehow that old tradition of friendli-
ness, kindness, and respect reappeared.

4. A CORDED BED
This photograph illustrates the rope wrench used to tighten the
ropes on a corded bed (Vol. I, pp. 139—41). You can make a dupli-
cate easily for your own corded bed. To tighten the ropes, simply fol-
low the path the man used who wove the rope through the bedframe
in the first place. Work with the loops that appear on the outside of the
frame. Start with the first loop the rope makes, "foul" the forked
wrench in the loop, twist until the first length of rope is tight, drive the
wooden peg into place in the hole in the bedframe to hold that first
rope length tightly in place; then move to the second loop at the op-
posite end with the forked wrench, twist the second length of rope
tight, have your helper free the wooden peg from the first hole and
bring it up to you to be driven into the second hole to hold the second
length tight while you move to the third loop down at the opposite end
of the bedframe, and so on until the whole web is the desired tension.
Retie the knot at the end of the rope that holds the whole web in place
so that you won't lose that tension, and you're in business.

6. SOAPMAKING
Martin Pilgrim's family has an ingenious method for testing soap
which we have just learned about. As the melted fat was mixed with
the boiling lye [Vol. i, pp. 155-58], a feather would be stirred briefly
in the mixture. If it ate the bristles off the feather, there was still too
much lye in the mixture. Fat would be mixed in slowly until the solu-
tion could no longer damage a feather. At that point the liquid was
ready to pour out into a container to harden into a jelly-like soap.
Millard Buchanan's recipe for soap is as follows: Use five pounds of
grease, one box of Red Devil Lye, three tablespoons of borax, two ta-
blespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of salt, one-fourth cup of am-
monia and one-half cup of boiling water.
Mix the lye in a pan with a quart of hot water and stir until the lye
is dissolved. Let it cool, and add the lukewarm, dissolved grease. Mix
the borax with a half cup of boiling water, and add it along with the
other ingredients. When all the ingredients are dissolved and well
mixed, pour the solution into flat, shallow pans to harden into soap.
When hard, the soap can be cut into bars for use.
7. RECIPES
AUNT ARIE'S RECIPE FOR LEATHER BREECHES BEANS—
—Take good, full green beans ("If they're nothin' but slabs, they ain't
fit t'eat"), and string them on ten or twelve spool thread and break
off the ends. Don't hang them out in the open air or they'll mold.
Aunt Arie hangs them from the rafters in the warm, still dark air of her
attic. She doesn't like to put them in the sun for fear it will make them
brittle and tough.
To cook them, she takes down as many strings of beans as she needs
and soaks them overnight. In the morning, she parboils them for an
hour on the wood stove, with a little soda added in to soften them up.
She doesn't use over a teaspoon of soda as too much makes them yel-
low.
When they've parboiled for an hour, she takes them out, washes and
rinses them, puts them in a pot with clear water and several large
chunks of fat meat (pork) and cooks them for two or three hours more
until they're soft and done.

ADA KELLY'S RECIPE FOR CORNBREAD 
Cook one quart
of corn meal mush until thoroughly done. Salt to taste. Remove from
heat and add cold water until you can bear your finger in it. Then
add 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup lard, and meal enough to make stiff as corn-
bread. Set aside until it ferments (overnight). Add meal to make
medium batter. Bake in well-greased pan in slow oven. Remove from
pan when cold.
Margaret Norton's pickling recipes (Vol. 1, pp. 176—80):
ICICLE PICKLES 
Use two gallons of cucumbers, one pint
coarse salt, one gallon of boiling water, one walnut-sized lump of
alum, two quarts of vinegar, four quarts of white sugar, one grain of
saccharine (one tablet), one tablespoon of pickling spice, two table-
spoons of celery seed, and two tablespoons of cinnamon buds.
Split cucumbers lengthwise, no matter how small they are. Add the
salt to the boiling water and pour it over the cucumbers. Let it stand
one week.
Then drain, cover with boiling water again and let stand twenty-
four hours. Then drain, dissolve the alum in boiling water and pour it
over the pickles. Let stand twenty-four hours.
Then drain the pickles and take two quarts of vinegar and four
quarts of sugar and all the spices and boil them together and pour them
over the pickles. Do this for four mornings, each time pouring off the
liquid, reboiling it, and pouring it back over the pickles again boiling
hot.
Then seal them in a can. (They will also keep in an open jar, but
most people seal them for the winter.)
LIME PICKLES 
Use seven pounds of cut-up tomatoes (green)
or cucumbers to make seven quarts. Also use three cups of builder's
lime and two gallons of cold water.
Let all soak together for twenty-four hours. Then let the pickles soak
in clear water for four hours, changing the water every hour.
Then make a syrup of three pints of vinegar, five pounds of white
sugar, two tablespoons of pickling spice, and bring it all to a boil. Add
the cucumbers and let them stand overnight. Then boil them for one
hour, pack them in glass jars, and seal.
SPICED GRAPES 
For this relish (used with meat, bread, etc.),
use seven pounds of grapes (Concord or wine grapes), one cup of fruit

============================================================
PAGE 397

APPENDIX 
401
vinegar, two teaspoons of cinnamon, five pounds of sugar, one teaspoon
of cloves, and one teaspoon of allspice.
Wash, stem, and pulp grapes. Put pulp with seeds over fire and
cook until the seeds come free. Add skins and pulp together, and also
add the sugar, vinegar, and spices. Cook until thick and can.
PICKLED GREEN TOMATOES 
Wash and quarter green to-
matoes. Pack them raw into pint jars, adding to each jar two—three
small whole pods of hot pepper and one quartered pod of bell pepper.
Make a brine of two parts vinegar, one part water, and one part
sugar and heat it until the sugar melts. Pour into the packed jars leav-
ing a half-inch at the top. Put on the lids and rings and process fifteen
minutes in a water bath.
PICKLED PEACHES OR APPLES 
Peel apples or peaches,
quarter, and put in a pot. Make enough brine of two parts vinegar,
two parts sugar, and one part water to cover the fruit. Add ground
cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to taste, and cook until tender. When
done, lift the fruit out and pack into jars. Keep brine simmering and
pour into jars over the fruit leaving one-half inch at the top. Seal im-
mediately.
Others:
AUNT ARIE'S RECIPE FOR EGG CUSTARD (cooked on a
wood stove) 
Line a small pie pan with plain biscuit dough rolled
thin. Then, in a separate bowl, mix up one egg (beaten well), one cup
of sweet milk, a handful of flour, a teaspoon of nutmeg, a half a tea-
cup of sugar.
Mix it all up well, pour it into the crust, and, using just a little
wood so the fire won't be too hot, bake it slowly until it "sets." It
will "blubber up"—or bubble, and then the bubbles will settle.
At this point, it is ready to eat. Serves four.
SWEET POTATO PUDDING 
Mix together two cups of cooked
and mashed sweet potato, one-half cup brown sugar, one cup sweet
milk, two eggs, one teaspoon vanilla, and one-half cup each of raisins
and grated coconut. Bake in a casserole dish in a moderate oven for
about a half-hour, or until firm. Serve hot or cold.
IRISH POTATO DUMPLINGS 
Peel and quarter about a

quart of potatoes. Put them in a pot, cover with one and one-half to
two quarts of water, add salt and pepper to taste, a tablespoon of but-
ter and a cup of sweet milk. Boil until the potatoes are tender.
Roll biscuit dough out one-quarter-inch thick, cut in two-inch
squares and drop into the rapidly boiling water the potatoes are in.
Cook dumplings about one minute, take the pot off the heat, and the
whole thing is ready to serve.
PEPPER SAUCE 
Use fourteen large onions, one dozen green
bell peppers, one dozen ripe bell peppers.
Chop ingredients up fine, pour boiling water over them and let
stand for five minutes, and then drain. Put back in a kettle and pour
on more boiling water, let boil two minutes, drain, and then put back
in kettle again.
Add two—three pints of vinegar, two cups of sugar, and two table-
spoons of salt and boil for fifteen minutes. Then can.
JAKE WALDROOP'S RECIPE FOR BLACKBERRY WINE
Gather six to eight gallons of wild blackberries, wash them well,
and put them in a big container. Mix in five pounds of sugar, and
then cover the top of the churn or container with a cloth, tied down
so air can get in but insects can't. Let the mixture work for eight to
ten days.
Then strain the mixture through a clean cloth, squeezing the pulp
so that all the juice is removed. Measure how many gallons of juice
you have. For every gallon of juice, add one and a half pounds of
sugar. Let it work off. When it stops (when the foaming and bubbling
has stopped on top), strain it again, measure the juice, and again add
one and a half pounds of sugar to each gallon of juice. When it
finishes working this time, it is done and can be bottled. Jake keeps
his in an earthenware jug with a corn cob stopper.
He makes grape wine the same way.
8. CURING PORK
Recently Jake Waldroop told us of a method of curing pork that
was quite different from any that we had published so far (see Vol. i,
pp. 199-201). It is as follows:
"The way we used t'do it, m'daddy an'all of us. Fer years an'years,
we'd salt it down an' let it git cured out good, y'know. We had a big
smokehouse an' it never had no floor. It'uz just dirt. Just on th'dirt.

"Well, he'd save his ashes all winter. He wouldn't bum nothin' but
hickory wood. An' if he seed anybody spit in that fireplace, why he'd
kick their hind end nearly. He wanted them ashes kept clean.
"An' he had'im a big ol'tub of steel, kind of a iron tub of a thing in
under his shed. He'uz just as careful. He'd take them ashes out
yonder an' he had'im a big ol'sifter. An' he'd sift them ashes through
there an' if they's any coals'r'anything, he separated'em; but them
ashes went down in that.
"Along up in th'spring 'bout last o'March, first o'April, why he'd
put'im down a layer of them ashes an' he'd put down a layer o'that
meat. Then he'd cover that first layer of meat with ashes, on thataway.

it would be salted down well. Then the pieces would be put into individual
cloth bags, tied shut, and hung from the rafters of the smokehouse. Here Eddie

th'summer you wanted t'git that an'they wadn't no strong edges. It'uz
just as good an'sweet bacon as any breakfast bacon y'kin buy now.
Better. Oh, it was real good. Put it up in hick'ry ashes."
We were also able to get Martin Pilgrim's method demonstrated
recently. His family (from Lookout Mountain, Tennessee), immedi-
ately after slaughtering, made a mixture of brown sugar and salt.
They used two cups of brown sugar to every cup of salt. The hams
would be disconnected at the last joint, and all joints packed with
salt to keep them from souring down inside the meat. Then the pieces
of meat would be rubbed down thoroughly on both sides over a
period of several days with the sugar/salt mixure. When they were
well saturated, they would be wrapped individually in brown paper,
sewn up in handspun cloth, and hung from the rafters by wires to
keep them safe from rats.

PLATE 386 Cracklin's.
In the spring, to keep skippers out, Martin's family would rub the
meat with a mixture of boric acid, salt, sugar, black pepper and red
pepper. Martin also said they would boil the backbones down with the
liver and some onions. When the meat loosened off the bones, the
bones would be removed and the mixture boiled again with sage—
then canned.
We also are now able to offer photographs of rendering lard im-
mediately after slaughtering. The scrap pieces of fat from meat and
intestine are boiled down into liquid form in an iron pot (Plate 385).
When the fat is all melted, Nelson Cabe dips it out of the pot and
strains the liquid through several layers of white cloth into the con-
tainers in which the lard will be kept. As the lard is strained, the
cloth catches hard, granular pieces of cooked skin and meat (Plate
386). These are the "cracklin's." They are set aside to mix up in
dough for cracklin' bread.
