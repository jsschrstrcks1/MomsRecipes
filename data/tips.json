For quick chilling, place bottles/cans in a deep tub of ice cubes. (3) Expect 3 oz wine per drink - about 8 drinks from a 750ml bottle. For bigger parties, buy 1.5-liter bottles. (4) Offer nonalcoholic options like eggnog, punch, or homemade soda pop. (5) Keep punches cold with ice rings made in ring molds. For decorative ice rings, line mold with citrus slices, berries, or melon balls, add water to cover fruit, freeze, then fill and freeze again. (6) You only need two types of glasses: 10-12 oz all-purpose glasses and 9-10 oz stemmed wineglasses. Disposable plastic glasses work well for large parties.",

Knead the dough to the stiffness called for in the recipe. Kneading develops the gluten of the flour, which determines the final structure of the bread loaf. To knead, fold the dough over and push down with the heel of your hand, curving your fingers over the dough. Give the dough a quarter-turn, then fold over and push down again. Continue this fold-push-turn procedure until the dough is smooth and elastic.",

      "tip": "With a little help from your microwave oven, you may be able to significantly shorten the time it takes to proof (raise) your yeast breads. Before you begin, check your owner's manual to see if proofing is recommended. Or use the following test to check your oven: Place 2 tablespoons cold stick margarine in a custard cup in the center of your oven. Micro-cook, uncovered, on 10% power (low) for 4 minutes. If the margarine doesn't completely melt, your microwave can proof yeast dough. But if the margarine does completely melt, your microwave will kill the yeast before the bread has a chance to rise. If so, you'll have to raise your yeast breads conventionally. If your oven passed the test, here's how to proceed: While kneading your dough, place 3 cups water in a 4-cup measure. Cook on 100% power (high) for 6\u00bd to 8\u00bd minutes or till boiling. Move measure to back of oven. Place kneaded dough in a greased bowl, turning once. Cover with waxed paper and place in microwave oven with hot water. Heat dough and water on 10% power (low) for 13 to 15 minutes or till dough has almost doubled. Punch dough down; shape as directed. Then place shaped dough in 8x4x2- or 9x5x3-inch loaf dishes. Return to microwave with hot water. Cover with waxed paper. Heat on low 6 to 8 minutes or till nearly doubled. (For round or long loaves that are shaped on baking sheets, or rolls that are shaped in muffin cups, you'll have to do the second proofing step conventionally.) For rich yeast breads (those with eggs and a slightly higher proportion of sugar), proofing times will be slightly longer. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for the first proofing time, and 10 to 14 minutes for the second proofing time.",

Brush with melted margarine or butter. Use the dull edge of a table knife to make an off-center crease in each round. Fold each round along the crease so the large half is on top.

Before dipping candy, chop the coating and melt it in a heavy saucepan over low heat. Semisweet chocolate and milk chocolate also can be used for dipping. But these products usually need to be tempered (melted and then cooled to the correct dipping temperature). Without tempering, the chocolate often speckles or develops gray streaks as it hardens. This speckling is called blooming and affects only the appearance, not the quality or flavor, of the candy. If a small amount of speckling doesn't bother you, go ahead and use untempered chocolate for dipping. To learn more about tempering, see a candy-making cookbook.",

For rolled cookies, chill the dough before rolling it, or freeze it just until it's firm enough to roll. With a standard mixer, start mixing on low speed so you don't sling the flour out of the bowl.
