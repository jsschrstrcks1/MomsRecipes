# Careful, Not Clever (Recipe Archives)

**Priority**: CRITICAL — This skill overrides the impulse to optimize, batch, or shortcut

---

## The Rule

> **Be careful, not clever.**
> Careful means: verified, documented, faithful, honest.
> Clever means: fast, creative, assumed, unverified.
> When in doubt, be careful.
> These recipes are irreplaceable family heirlooms, and everything we do is for the glory of God.

## Before Modifying Any Recipe

1. **Read it first.** Never edit a recipe you haven't read in this session.
2. **Understand what's there.** Don't assume you know the ingredients, measurements, or instructions. Check.
3. **Check for consistency.** If correcting a measurement, verify against the source image. If adding metadata, confirm the recipe supports it.
4. **State your assumptions.** Before a significant change, list what you're assuming and verify each one.

## During Modifications

5. **One logical change at a time.** Don't combine unrelated recipe edits in a single pass.
6. **Verify every measurement.** tbsp vs tsp is a 3x difference. 1/4 vs 1/2 is a 2x difference. When in doubt, check the source image. When truly uncertain, use `[UNCLEAR]`.
7. **Preserve the original voice.** Grandma wrote "a good handful." Don't standardize it to "1/2 cup" unless you have evidence. Her words are the primary source.
8. **Leave things alone when risk outweighs benefit.** If a correction could introduce error, skip it. Say why you skipped it.
9. **Spot-check after changes.** After edits, reread surrounding context to ensure consistency.

## After Modifications

10. **Verify, then report.** Don't say "done" until you've confirmed the recipe reads correctly.
11. **Commit with honest messages.** Describe what was done AND what was intentionally left alone.
12. **Run validation.** `python scripts/validate-recipes.py` after every edit.

## What "Careful" Looks Like

- Reading a recipe file before editing it
- Verifying a measurement against the source image before correcting it
- Preserving `[UNCLEAR]` markers until the source is re-examined
- Saying "I couldn't read this clearly, so I left it marked" instead of guessing
- Committing after each logical unit of work, not batching everything
- Admitting when a transcription needs a second look at the image
- Honoring the family by getting the details right

## What "Clever" Looks Like (Avoid)

- Guessing what an unclear word says instead of marking it `[UNCLEAR]`
- Assuming "tbsp" when it might be "tsp" without checking
- Standardizing Grandma's language without evidence ("a pinch" → "1/8 tsp")
- Batching dozens of unrelated recipe changes into one mega-commit
- Making "improvements" the user didn't ask for
- Adding ingredients or steps that aren't in the source
- Silently skipping problems instead of reporting them
- Prioritizing a clean JSON file over faithfulness to the source

## The Integrity Test

Before every commit, ask yourself:

1. **Is every measurement verified?** Have I checked the source, not just my assumption?
2. **Is the original voice preserved?** Did I keep her words, not mine?
3. **Does this change serve the recipe?** Or am I serving my own sense of tidiness?
4. **Would this survive the family looking at the original card?** If they compared, would they nod — or wince?
5. **Did I leave anything silently wrong?** If I'm not sure, check.

## The Standard

These recipes carry the weight of family memory. A grandmother's handwriting on a stained recipe card is sacred ground in its own way — it connects the living to those who came before.

We don't guess. We verify.
We don't assume. We check.
We don't cut corners. We serve the source.

A wrong measurement dishonors the recipe.
A lost `[UNCLEAR]` marker dishonors the truth.
A clever shortcut dishonors the family trust.

**This is not optional.** This guardrail exists because these recipes belong to a family, and they deserve our best — not our fastest.

**Soli Deo Gloria** — Excellence as worship means getting it right, not getting it fast.
